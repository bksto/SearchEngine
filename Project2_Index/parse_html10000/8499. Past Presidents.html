At University of The Pacific in Stockton, Calif., Moore served as dean of students and later provost of Callison College, and was appointed president of Mankato State University in Minnesota in 1974.

Dawson left the University in January 1978. George Henry Armacost 1945-1970 Assuming the presidency in 1945, 40-year-old George Henry Armacost began his 25-year career at Redlands. Armacost graduated from Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, where he majored in chemistry with minors in physics, history, and social science. He earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1940 and subsequently taught and served as an administrator at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. During Armacost’s tenure the University experienced substantial growth. The student body increased from just over 1,100 students to more than 1,700, and the campus itself grew, with 21 buildings constructed during the period, including Watchorn Hall for the School of Music, Hornby Hall for science, and residence facility Cortner Hall. Study abroad and the Salzburg Semester, a hallmark of the University’s program, began in 1959-60. Johnston College, envisioned as a collateral college within the University, and its entire structural complex of East Hall and West Hall (now Williams Hall) and Orton Center, was born out of societal changes in the 1960s. George Armacost and his wife Verda continued to be actively involved in the life of the University after his retirement, and Armacost Library is named in his honor. Elam Jonathan Anderson 1938-1944 Elam J. Anderson was born in Chicago, Ill. in 1890. He earned his A.B. degree from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa in 1912, a master’s degree from Cornell University in 1915, and his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1924. He served as professor of education and music at the University of Shanghai in China from 1918-1926 and was principal of the Shanghai American School from 1926-1932. Following his service in China, he became president of Linfield College in McMinnville, Ore., and was selected to be president of University of Redlands in the spring of 1938. President Anderson ably led the University through the end of the Great Depression and during WWII and was instrumental in Redlands becoming a site for the U.S. Navy’s V-12 training program. Students during the period developed the chant “kneel and pray with Elam J.”, a reference to his strong Christian principles. President Anderson died in August, 1944. Clarence Howe Thurber 1933-1937 Clarence Howe Thurber was born Sept. 18, 1888 in Guilford, Vermont, and completed his undergraduate degree at Colgate University in N.Y., achieving membership in Phi Beta Kappa. He then taught at Phillips Andover Academy, Wabash College, and Purdue University, and in 1920 began graduate study at Columbia University, completing his Ph.D. in 1922. He then went on to teach at Syracuse University, and in 1930 was hired as dean of the faculty, director of the educational program, and head of the department of education. Upon ascending to the presidency at University of Redlands in 1933, Thurber brought more than a decade of university administrative experience as well as a new philosophy and teaching methods to the school. President Thurber and his family left the University following the end of the spring semester in 1937. Victor LeRoy Duke 1914-1933 Victor LeRoy Duke earned his A.B. degree from Shurtleff College, a Baptist school in Alton, Ill. in 1897, followed by a master’s degree in 1903. At Shurtleff he taught mathematics for 12 years after completion of his undergraduate degree. In 1909, President Field hired Duke to teach math at University of Redlands. In addition to his role as professor, Duke played on men’s athletic teams during the early years of the school in order to ensure enough players on the field. He was promoted to dean of the University in 1913 and was appointed president in 1914, serving in that capacity until his death in 1933. During Duke’s presidency, the University experienced remarkable growth both in the student body and the campus itself, with such notable buildings as the Hall of Science (later renamed in his honor), the Hall of Letters, Currier Gymnasium, and Memorial Chapel constructed in this period. Jasper Newton Field 1909-1914 Jasper Newton Field was born in 1855 on a farm in rural Ohio. Ordained in 1878 by Union Regular Baptist Church in Union County, Ohio, he earned a bachelor of science degree from Denison College in 1883. He went on to earn a bachelor of divinity degree from the Baptist Union Theological Seminary of Morgan Park, Ill. in 1888. During his career as a minister, he served in Urbana, Ohio; Canton, Ohio; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Fort Wayne, Ind. before becoming the minister at the First Baptist Church of Redlands in 1906. He quickly became involved within the community and was appointed chairman of a commission to establish a Baptist college in Southern California the same year. The young town of Redlands was selected as the site for the school, and Field became the first president of University of Redlands on March 1, 1909. Following the appointment, his alma mater Denison University conferred upon him the degree Doctor of Divinity in honor of his new position. He served as president of the University until 1914. Two of Field’s daughters numbered among the earliest graduating classes of the University. After leaving the presidency, he and his wife Adelaide moved to Los Angeles and then to Cleveland, Ohio. The Fields returned to Redlands in the mid-1920s, and in 1926 he became the minister of Calvary Baptist Church in San Bernardino, where he served until his death in 1929.
