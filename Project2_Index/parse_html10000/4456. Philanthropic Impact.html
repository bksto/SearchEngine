Raising funds for scholarships is one of the primary goals at the University’s Annual Gala. Watch the inspiring stories of perseverance and achievement told by three of our students—Scott, Anderson and Brittany—who are pursuing their dreams with the help of donor support. Scott Rice B.S. Business Administration, 2015 Recipient of the Men's Soccer Scholarship Growing up in Southern California, Scott fell in love with soccer at a young age. His knack for the sport and positive presence on the field were immediately felt on the CSUSM squad. As a freshman Scott was named MVP after leading the Cougars to their first conference title. In 2013 he was named NAIA All-America Honorable Mention and was one of the team's highest scoring athletes. Passionate about serving the community, Scott helped develop a new reading program at Paloma Elementary School, teaching students about character building and the importance of education. Poised for his best and final season with the Cougars this fall, Scott plans to pursue a professional career in soccer after graduation. Anderson Gould, Jr. B.A. Visual and Performing Arts, 2015 Recipient of the Veterans Support Scholarship, Charlene Smylie Scholarship and the Navajo Nation Scholarship After high school, Anderson followed the rich tradition of his Navajo tribe and joined the U.S. Marine Corps. While supporting his family, serving his country and coaching his son's many sports teams, Anderson always held onto his dream of being the first in his family to graduate college. When his son entered high school, he decided to pursue his passion for the digital arts. This fall he will lead the American Indian Student Alliance and continue to share his talent as one of CSUSM's official student photographers. After graduation, Anderson plans to earn his master's degree and start his own business in video and audio design. Brittany Forester B.A. Human Development, 2014 Master of Social Work, 2017 Recipient of the ACE Gap Scholarship Brittany was eight years old when she entered foster care. In and out of more homes than she can count, her resilient spirit kept her determined, inspiring in her a desire to change the foster care experience. While earning her degree at CSUSM, she applied her studies by working with at-risk youth at North County Lifeline, a local not-for-profit. When unexpected medical expenses nearly halted her educational dreams, the support of CSUSM's ACE Scholars Services and the help of generous scholarships kept her in school. In May, Brittany became the first in her family to earn a bachelor's degree. This fall she will begin CSUSM's Master of Social Work program and take her next step toward her goal of becoming a legislative advocate for foster youth and neglected children.
