Home / Online Classes / Are Online Classes For Me? Succeeding in online courses depends on a student's self-motivation and self-discipline..... Each student's learning style is as unique as her or his own personality. Some people thrive while working independently on assignments; others may need more guidance to complete their tasks.   Is online learning for you? Here are some questions to see if you’re ready for an online class: Are you good at prioritizing workloads and staying on schedule? Can you get the work done without continuous supervision? Can you understand and interpret written materials? Does your work and home life allow you flexibility? Do you have access to a computer and the Internet? Are you familiar with opening and sending emails or how to copy and paste a document?  If you answered yes to most of these questions, you’re ready for online classes!  Browse All Online Classes Succeeding in Online Classes Computer Requirements & Support Online Courses Access (UAP) Handbook for Online Students International Students and Online Classes Blackboard Access & Information Are Online Classes For Me?
