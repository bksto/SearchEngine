How do I get a second opinion outside of my HMO medical group? California law allows for a second opinion consultation when you have questions about a diagnosis, want more information about a treatment plan or if you are not satisfied with the results of treatment you have received.  If you’ve seen a specialist in your medical group (e.g. Sansum Clinic, Santa Barbara Select IPA, Seaview IPA), you may request a second opinion consultation with a physician outside of your medical group from your insurance plan (e.g. Health Net, Kaiser, Anthem Blue Cross).  See the requirements by plan listed below. The consulting physician must be a provider for your insurance plan.  The approval will go faster if you know which specialist you wish to consult for the second opinion. Second opinion referrals are for consultation ONLY.  The consulting physician will not be able to order tests or provide any treatment unless that level of care is pre-approved in the referral authorization. You should provide the second opinion specialist with all relevant medical records and test results for review - take them with you or send them to the specialist prior to your appointment. (Make sure you request your records well in advance of the appointment.) You pay your normal office visit copay. Call your insurance plan to request a second opinion consultation.  The member services representative will ask you a few questions to clarify your situation: what is your diagnosis the name of the specialist you consulted in your medical group the name of the physician you wish to see for the second opinion consultation The insurance will confirm the consulting physician is in the HMO network. Once the consultation is approved, the insurance will send both you and the consulting physician a written authorization explaining the limits of the consultation. 1-800-539-4072          Health Net Member Services 1-800-464-4000          Kaiser Member Services 1-888-209-7975          Anthem Blue Cross Plus Member Services _____________________ Requirements by Plan: Blue Cross Plus – In-Network (HMO): Blue Cross Plus members must FIRST ask their HMO physician for an authorization to see a physician outside of their HMO medical group for the second opinion.  If that request is denied by the physician or the medical group, the member can call Anthem member services to request a second opinion consultation.   Tell Anthem Member Services that you wish to use your in-network benefits for the consultation.  Ask Member Services to refer the request to the Transition Department for review. You can select from Anthem Plus and Anthem PPO providers for the second opinion.

A Lead Worker is an incumbent that functions in a “lead” capacity for a group of employees working on a project or a specific assignment basis. The Lead Worker does not have full formal supervisory authority for staff assigned to projects; however, in order to complete projects/assignment must be able to schedule and control the daily working arrangements for a specified group of employees. A Supervisor is an incumbent that customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more career employees working in a department/unit and has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring or firing and as to the advancement and promotion or any other change of status of other employees will be given particular weight. Compensation My supervisor assigned new duties to me. Do I have to perform them if they are not on my job description? Yes.  Your supervisor has a right to assign new duties to you and you are expected to begin performing them upon receipt of the assignment.  If the new duties make up 20% or more of your position, your supervisor should add them to your job description and submit the job description to Compensation for review. OACIS-Why can't I find an employee's job description in the JD library? The job description may never have been input into OACIS; or the job description may have accidently been used to create a requisition for someone else; or you may not have access to it if it's in a different department code.  If the Employee is in the same Department Code as you are, then you should be able to access the Job Description Library to view and print the job description.  Convinced you input a job description but still can’t find it?  Contact your Compensation Analyst directly for assistance. Are employees appointed to the Managers & Senior Professionals personnel group allowed to hold dual employment? Delegation of Authority 2070 states that dual employment may only be approved if the employee is appointed to a position in the Professional & Support Staff personnel group (see 2.a. above). Consequently, employees appointed to the Managers & Senior Professionals personnel group are not eligible to hold dual employment. OACIS-How do I search for job descriptions in the Job Description Library? Log in to OACIS, click on Job Description Library on the left navigation bar, then search by the employee’s name.  Note: When using the search options, you do not have to fill out all the fields.  For instance, if you want to find all descriptions of employees in your department with the first name of “Nancy”, you would only type in “Nancy” in the First Name field. You only have access to job descriptions in the departments for which you have OACIS access. How do I handle an employee who is close to or at the salary range maximum? The system will allow you to merit an employee up to the range maximum only, so it may revise your original entry. MERIT - What determines an employee’s eligibility for a merit increase? Eligibility requirements will vary according to the contract or policy. Please refer to the guidelines and procedures for the specific merit population. What is a "Desk Audit" and can I request one? A desk audit is an “interview” by a Compensation Analyst with the incumbent of the position in order to gather more information to aid in the evaluation of the position. Desk audits are not done by request. They are only conducted when a compensation analyst feels it is necessary to gain further information or clarification about the duties and responsibilities of a position that has been formally submitted for reclassification. Who is responsible for printing and retaining signed job descriptions? Supervisors are now responsible for printing out an employee job description and obtaining wet signatures after the employee has been hired, the job description has been updated, or a reclassification has been approved. It is also their responsibility to give a copy of the signed job description to the employee for their records and retain the original signed copy in the department's personnel files. They do not need to send the signed job description to Human Resources. If a non-exempt employee works overtime without obaining prior approval from his/her supervisor, is the department obligated to compensate premium overtime? Yes. Regardless of whether or not the overtime was authorized in advance, the department is obligated to pay unauthorized overtime. Corrective action may be appropriate against the employee for not following department procedure. Ultimately it is the Supervisor's responsibility to know and be aware when an employee works overtime and to address unauthorized overtime in a timely way. DUAL EMP - Is dual employment allowed under policy? Dual employment is only allowed in certain circumstances. Delegation of Authority 2070 (July 29, 1996) authorizes Chancellors, the Laboratory Director, the Executive Vice President–Business Operations, and the Vice President–Agriculture and Natural Resources to approve dual employment if all of the following criteria are met: a. The employee is appointed to a full-time position in the Professional & Support Staff personnel group; b. The additional work is in another department or in a different classification in the same department; c. It is impractical to employ another person; d. The additional appointment will not exceed a total of twelve calendar months; e. The time worked in the additional appointment will not have a negative impact on the employee’s performance; and f. The employee’s full-time department head agrees to the arrangement.   Locations may have local procedures with additional restrictions to those listed above. Otherwise, PPSM 30, Section K. states that an employee with a 100% appointment can only receive additional compensation from the University for: • Overtime earned by non-exempt employees, • Teaching regularly scheduled University Extension courses, and • Administrative stipends.   An employee who receives additional compensation for any of these reasons does not have dual employment.     How long does the reclass process take? Generally 30-45 days, however, if a desk audit is needed or union notice required, the process may take longer.  Other delays may occur as well due to variables in the Compensation Unit such as workload, staffing and other special projects. DUAL EMP - Can an employee hold dual employment or work over 100% without any restrictions if the additional appointment is at another campus? No, the restrictions in PPSM 30 and Delegation of Authority 2070 apply to all appointments an employee holds, regardless of location. In addition, an employee who works at multiple locations is limited to 100% total per Accounting Manual P-196-38 (Interlocation Transfers and Appointments). MERITS - How do I get my own merit entered, if I’m the department preparer? Please make every effort to have someone else enter your merit rating and salary increase. “Someone else” can either be another preparer in your department, a department chair with an account, or a control point. If it is absolutely not possible for another person to enter it, then you may enter your own, but you should follow through with documentation to your control point. An example of documentation could be an email to the control point with a copy going to the department chair. Your control point may give you further instructions on this topic. Note that all “self-updates” are marked with a flag in the system and will be reviewed at the end of the process. Can exempt employees work part-time? Yes, but the part-time employee must also be compensated on a salaried basis. For example, if an exempt employee has a 50% appointment, they would be paid at 50% of the established monthly rate. The workload should be adjusted as appropriate. OACIS-How do I print a Job Description? To print an employee’s job description, log in to OACIS, click on “Job Description Library” link on the left margin.  Search for the employee’s job description on the next screen, then click on “Get Reports List” underneath the employee’s name.  Click on “Generate Report” to see the printable PDF version of the employee’s job description. Can a supervisor be non-exempt? Yes. DUAL EMP - What is dual employment? Dual employment is the term used to describe additional time worked by a staff employee in a second appointment when he/she also holds a 100% appointment. Dual employment occurs when the employee performs the additional work repeatedly, rather than on a one-time or sporadic basis. How do I inquire about the status of my reclass? Employees should consult with their immediate supervisor regarding the status of their reclassification. Supervisors may consult directly with the Compensation Unit regarding the status of the reclass review. FLSA - What happens if an employee holds multiple appointments with different FLSA statuses? These situations require consultation and review by Human Resources, sometimes in collaboration with Academic Personnel. Please contact Compensation for assistance. When will the Supervisor know that the Compensation Analyst has finished reviewing a job description? After the Compensation Analyst has reviewed the job description, they will approve it and submit it to the Job Description Library.  When this happens, the Supervisor will receive an auto-generated email. MERITS - What do I enter for the performance evaluation rating and date? Performance ratings are entered as 1, 2, 3, 4 or X. 1 = Demonstrates a high degree of expertise and mastery in all aspects of the position in a professional manner. 2 = Fully performs the entire range of duties in a professional manner. 3 = Generally performs essential duties satisfactorily. 4 = Does not perform essential duties in a satisfactory manner. X = No written performance evaluation has been done. Date format is MM/YY, and it cannot be later than the current month. If using “X” as a performance rating, enter the current month (MM/YY). NOTE: Performance evaluations should take place sometime during the twelve months prior to the merit effective date. What is a non-exempt employee? Non-exempt employees are defined as employees who, based on duties performed and manner of compensation, shall be subject to all FLSA provisions. Because of hourly pay practices, an employee appointed to a per diem position shall be treated as a non-exempt employee subject to FLSA minimum wage and overtime provisions. Non-exempt employees shall be required to account for time worked on an hourly and fractional hourly basis and are to be compensated for qualified overtime hours at the premium (time-and-one-half) rate. Non-exempt titles are identified in University wide title and pay plans.   Does my job have to change by at least 50% to be reclassified? No. The “50% rule” implies that at least 50% of your duties should be classifiable at a higher level in order to be eligible for an upgrade (a.k.a. upward reclassification).  Your position may already have a blend of levels in it and only need to change by 30% to cause a shift in the balance of the classification level. OACIS - Who is responsible to enter an employee's job description into the system for the first time? The Supervisor. If a Supervisor has employees reporting to him/her, the Supervisor should be set up in the system as a "Submitter". Contact Human Resources at x4664 to set up an account. Can I request a reclass on my own? If you have made a reasonable effort to work with your supervisor on the review of your position and you strongly disagree with their assessment of your job, you may contact a Compensation Analyst in HR for advice on how to submit your own reclassification. FLSA - What happens if the employee’s appointments have different FLSA statuses (one appointment is non-exempt and one is exempt) in a dual employment situation? These situations require consultation and review by Human Resources, sometimes in collaboration with Academic Personnel. Please contact Compensation for assistance. OACIS-Why am I not receiving emails when an action has been submitted to Compensation? The decision for Reviewers to receive or not receive emails for different “action status changes” is made at the time your user account is set up. To make changes, contact Human Resources at x4664. RECLASS - How do I handle an employee with a temporary reclassification or stipend? Only the permanent position can be merited during the web merit process, although both will appear on rosters. As long as the temporary reclassification or stipend shows up on a separate roster line, you’ll be able to delete that temporary line from the roster without disrupting the permanent position (this is an example of an appropriate use of the delete function). Keep in mind that the two lines may appear on two different departments’ rosters. Later, follow your usual process on requesting rate increases for temporary reclassifications and stipends (if appropriate) – request control point approval, then contact HR Compensation with the approved request. What is an exempt employee or position? There are three categories under which an employee may be considered exempt.  They are administrative, executive, and professional.  These categories generally define an exempt employee as one who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgement in the performance of his/her duties.  Exempt employees must pass a Salary Basis Test, i.e., they must be compensated at a minimum salary that is at least $455/week (or $27.63/hr for exempt computer employees). The Administrative exemption is for non-manual or office work directly related to management policies or general business administration.  Positions customarily and regularly exercise independent judgment and discretion more than 50% of the time.  Work is performed under general supervision and may require special training, experience, or knowledge.  The Executive exemption is for positions whose primary duty is management of a department or subdivision in addition to exercising independent judgment and discretion more than 50% of the time.  Under the executive exemption, positions must directly supervise 2 or more full-time employees and have the ability to make employment and disciplinary decisions. The Professional exemption is for work that requires an advanced degree and that is original or creative in nature.  Independent judgment and discretion must be excercized in these positions more than 50% of the time.   In addition, certain computer professions may be considered exempt under the Professional exemption when they meet certain criteria and are paid on a salary basis or an hourly basis that is at least $27.63/hr. Exempt employees are defined as employees who, based on duties performed and manner of compensation, shall be exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) minimum wage and overtime provisions. Because of hourly pay practices, an employee appointed to a per diem position in an exempt title shall be treated as a non-exempt employee subject to FLSA minimum wage and overtime provisions. Exempt employees shall be paid an established monthly or annual salary and are expected to fulfill the duties of their position regardless of hours worked. The workweek for full-time exempt employees is normally considered to be 40 hours, and for part-time employees the proportion of 40 hours equivalent to the appointment percentage; however, greater emphasis is placed on meeting the responsibilities assigned to the position than on working a specified number of hours. Exempt employees are not eligible to receive overtime compensation or compensatory time off. Generally speaking, exempt employees are expected to be present at work during their scheduled work times in order to perform work that is essential to the unit’s operations. They are also expected to arrive at a certain time in order to assure that the workplace is properly staffed for business. Management should discuss with their exempt employees how their expectations of work relate to time spent at work. Management can ask exempt employees to inform them if they will not be at work during some hours of a typical work day. It is not only common courtesy, but it is necessary so that others who need to coordinate with that employee can be informed of the change in work schedule for the day. Exempt titles are identified in the University wide title and pay plan, located on TCS. Does time worked at another UC campus count towards the limited appointment clock? Limited appointment employees are restricted to working under 1000 hours in any rolling 12 month period - including hours worked at another UC campus. RECLASS - How does Compensation determine the appropriate classification? Your position has been classified based on the majority of work being done in the position and an analysis of compensable factors.  Most jobs include a variety of duties, spanning a variety of levels and job series.  The Compensation Analyst is responsible for evaluating the duties based on compensable factors and determining if more than 50% are classifiable at a higher level. The most common compensable factors are complexity, freedom to act, consequence of error, scope (variety of duties), supervision, accountability for resources, and level of communications. Here is an example of a clerical position and how a Compensation analyst might break it down: 25% Budget Assistance (__Assistant III) 30% PPS/Payroll (__Assistant III) 20% Conference Coordination ( __Assistant II) 10% Department Reception ( __Assistant I)            10% Travel (__Assistant II) 10% General Clerical Assistance to Manager (__Assistant II) 5% Other  ------------------------------------------------- Overall Classification level  = __Assistant III (55% of duties -> majority) If you have evaluated all the functions and duties of your position, and you believe that the majority of work factors out to a higher level, then contact your Supervisor to let them know that you believe you may be working “out of class” and would like to have your job description submitted for reclassification. If your supervisor agrees with your assessment, then they would need to follow the on-line classification procedures for submitting a reclassification.  If your supervisor doesn’t agree with your assessment, they should give you an explanation.   Are departments required to pay premium overtime to "non-exempt" employees who work over 40 hours a week, or do departments have the discretion to provide compensatory time off? For Non-Exclusively Represented Staff (PPSM): At the time overtime work is assigned, managers/supervisors need to discuss the method of compensation prior to authorizing the overtime. Management may offer either payment or Compensatory Time Off (CTO). The employee selects the method - payment or CTO. For Exclusively Represented Employees: Please consult respective contracts for current practice. See "Hours of Work/Overtime Guidelines" for more information on Compensatory TIme Off and election forms. I normally log in to OACIS as a Reviewer, but now I need to submit a reclass. How do I do that? You need to “switch hats” for a session and become a Submitter.  Log on and click on Change User Type on the left side of the page.  (If you don’t see this as an option on the left menu, contact HR.)  Click the user type Submitter for that session and click Change Group.  Make sure the top of the page now says "Submitter", that your left menu options have now changed, and the top of your screen indicates your revised "group name” of ‘Submitter’.  The next time you log in, it will revert to the last group name you chose, so you’ll have to repeat the steps above to become a Reviewer again. RECLASS - What is the difference between a promotion and a reclass? A promotion is the assignment of an employee from one position to another position, by way of an open recruitment, wihich is in a class having a higher salary range maximum. A reclassification is the change of title of an employee's current position to a title of a different class having a higher salary range maximum. How do I know if my job should be reclassified? If you feel that your position has evolved to a higher level due to a significant change in duties, additional duties being added, or if the way you are now expected to perform the majority of your duties has evolved to a new level, then your position may be eligible for reclassification. STIPENDS - What are stipends awarded for? An administrative stipend is a form of compensation used to pay an employee who is temporarily assigned responsibilities of a higher level position. Please refer to "Temporary Job Changes" for more information on how to request approval for a temporary stipend. DUAL EMP - Which DOS codes should be used to pay an employee with dual employment? The following DOS codes must be used to pay an employee with dual employment: a. DEE – For dual employment at a fixed dollar amount (exempt employees). b. DES – For dual employment at the straight-time rate (non-exempt employees). c. DEP – For dual employment at the premium (time and one-half) rate (non-exempt employees). Using these codes will ensure that employees are paid appropriately and will allow the University to track and report on these appointments. The same codes will be used in the PeopleSoft system to pay and track dual employment appointments after the University transitions to UCPath; however, they will be called Earnings codes rather than DOS codes. OACIS-How do I submit a Reclass if I'm normally just a reviewer? You need to “switch hats” for a session and become a Submitter.  Log in to OACIS, then click on Change User Type on the left side of the page.  (If you don’t see this as an option on the left menu, contact HR.)  Click the user type you want to be for that session, Submitter, and click Change Group.  Make sure the top of the page now says "Your Current Group: Submitter" and that your left menu options have now changed.  The next time you log in, it will revert to the last group name you chose, so you’ll have to repeat the steps above to become a Reviewer again. MERITS - When should I delete an employee from the roster? Deleting an employee from the roster should be a rare occurrence. If an ineligible employee appears on the preliminary roster, you may need to correct some data fields in PPS to ensure that employee does not appear on the final roster. If an ineligible employee still appears on the final roster, then it might be appropriate to delete the employee from the roster. Otherwise eligible employees who are not receiving a merit increase (e.g., due to an unsatisfactory performance rating) should remain on the roster so that funds generated by their presence are left in the pool of available dollars. This is important for balancing the total amount spent against the overall control figure. What is red-circling? Red-Circling is when an employee's pay rate is approved to be above the established salary maximum for that position. Hence, the employee is usually not eligible for further base pay increases until the range maximum surpasses the employee's pay rate. OACIS-How do I change a job description with an appt type of limited to career? If the Limited appointment position was recruited for via OACIS.... Start an Update on the Job Description. On the Job Details tab change the appointment type to “Career”. On the Action Justification tab explain the purpose of the Update. Fill out any internal approvals on the Approval Steps tab. Submit to Compensation for review and approval. If the Limited Appointment position was NOT recruited for via OACIS..... Complete steps 1-5 above. Once Compensation has approved your Update create a Requisition from a Job Description. Fill out the necessary Waiver of Recruitment paperwork and attach it to the requisition on the Attached Documents tab before submitting to Employment. Once Employment reviews the requisition they approve a Hiring Proposal, which creates a Job Description in the JD Library. EQUITY - What is an equity adjustment? Equity adjustments are salary changes outside of the normal salary programs (promotions, reclassifications, merits, etc.) to remedy salary issues such as external pressure in high demand areas, internal salary compression, and/or retention considerations. Equity adjustments are not granted to reward performance. For specific information on use of equities please consult the Compensation unit or our Equity Guidelines. OACIS - What is OACIS (Online Application and Classification Information System)? OACIS is UCSB's online system for administering employment and classification functions, such as, submitting and posting job requisitions, reviewing applications, administering details of the recruitment, creating job descriptions, updating job descriptions, and requesting reclassifications. What is a range adjustment? A range adjustment is an across-the-board salary increase affecting individual employees' pay and their relative step-based pay structure. What is a confidential employee? A confidential employee is an employee who is required to develop or present management positions on collective bargaining, or whose duties normally require access to confidential information that contributes significantly to the development of management positions on collective bargaining. How should pay and overtime be addressed when an employee holds dual employment? Pay and overtime should be addressed in the following ways for dual employment situations: • If the employee is non-exempt, the employee must track all of the hours he/she works in each appointment and be paid overtime at the premium rate (1½ times the regular rate of pay) for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek (except for Police personnel, Hospital employees, and Firefighters – see PPSM 32 (Overtime), Section III.C.1-3). • If the employee is exempt, the employee does not track his/her hours and is paid a percentage of his/her base salary for the second appointment. The percentage will be determined based on the value of the work performed in the second appointment. MERITS - What do I do if someone is missing from my roster? During the preliminary roster stage, departments should determine whether an eligible employee is missing from the roster and make the necessary corrections in PPS, before the final roster is created. See the previous question/answer above to help determine what fields may need to be adjusted in PPS. If an employee is missing from the final roster, you will not be able to add him to the roster. Wait until the web process is completed to enter his new rate to PPS manually, using Action Code ‘04’. Along with processing this action in PPS, an email or memo must be sent to Human Resources stating the employee’s performance rating. What is an open range salary system? A salary structure with a minimum and maximum value to the pay range for a job. An individual progresses through the range based on performance or equity. OACIS-How do I process a lateral transfer or lateral reclass? A Lateral Transfer is when one employee moves into another position of the same classification and level, usually a different budget provision.  A Lateral Reclass is when an employee moves into a different position with a different classification but same level (same salary max), and they usually take their budget provision with them. Processing a Lateral Transfer- The supervisor/manager submits an Update for the Job Description the employee is moving into.  They will need to fill out the Briefly explain the basis for updating this Job Description: field on the Action Justification tab, explaining the purpose for a Lateral Transfer. They will also need to send an email to the Employment Manager explaining what they are doing. Compensation will approve/deny the Update. Processing a Lateral Reclass- 1. The supervisor/manager submits a Reclass for the job description. 2. The Compensation Analyst follows the procedures for denying or approving a Reclass (no employment involvement is needed). Is the FLSA status, (exempt/non-exempt determination), considered final or can determinations be appealed or changed based upon management comment? The FLSA status has been pre-determined for each title within a classification series. However, individual positions or performance may require further analysis by Compensation to ensure that the position is assigned to the appropriate classification. As always, positions must meet the classification specifications in order to be reclassified. Positions will not be reclassified for the purpose of avoiding overtime payments. COMP - What is the total value of my compensation? To determine the total value of your job, plus the value of your benefits, go to the Total Compensation Calculator on the UC systemwide website:              Total Comp Calculator (http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/applications/total_comp/index.php) How do I save my work in OACIS? There are two ways to save your work in OACIS. The easiest is to click on the “Save and Stay on this page” button at the end of each page. This will save your work and allow you to stay on the page you are currently working on.  An alternate way is to click on the “Preview Action” button at the end of the page, then choose the "Save" or “Save – Draft in Progress” option.  Be sure to save often!  The system automatically logs you out after 2 hours of inactivity.  If you have to step away from your computer for a moment, it’s a good idea to click “Save and Stay on the page” before you leave just to be on the safe side. what is a step-based salary system? A salary structure with standard progression rates established within a pay range for a job. Employees may progress from step to step on the basis of performance or other negotiated reasons. OACIS-If I am creating multiple job descriptions that have exactly the same duties, do I have to enter each one separately? You have to create a new Job Description for every individual employee, even if their job description happens to be exactly the same as another employee’s.  However, the system makes it easy for you to copy the duties from one job description and paste them directly into another employee’s job description.  In the “Search Duties to Copy” tab, you simply search for the employee’s job description you want to copy and click the “Select and Continue” button.  One caveat:  The employee whose job description you want to copy must already have an approved job description in the Job Description Library for this to work correctly.  HR advises that Supervisors with multiple, identical job descriptions enter the first one into OACIS then contact their Compensation Analyst to request an expedited review.  After the Compensation Analyst reviews the first job description and sends it to the Job Description Library, the Supervisor can then copy this employee’s duties in to the remaining job descriptions DUAL EMP - Is an employee allowed to have multiple part-time appointments that together add up to more than 100%?   Delegation of Authority 2070 does permit an employee to hold multiple part-time appointments that together add up to more than 100%, but only if the following criteria is met: a.     The additional work is in another department or in a different classification in the same department; b.     It is impractical to employ another person; c.     The additional appointment will not exceed a total of twelve calendar months; and d.     The time worked in the additional appointment will not have a negative impact on the employee’s performance.   MERITS - How can I determine why an employee is included in the roster? On the roster screen, click on the employee’s name in order to see what data was present in PPS at the time of the roster “snapshot”. An employee is selected for the roster based on the data present in a number of fields on PPS. Important fields in PPS that are used in employee selection include: Screen Field Data needed to indicate merit eligibility EAPP Appointment Type ‘2’ (Career) or ‘7’ (Partial-Year Career) EAPP Distribution End Date At least one distribution needs to end on or after the merit effective date EPER Next Salary Review Date Needs to be the merit effective date or earlier EPER Next Salary Review Type Should display ‘2’ or ‘3’, as appropriate EPER Employee Relations Code Needs to reflect appropriate code What is the 25% Increase rule? The 25% maximum increase rule is a system-wide policy located in PPSM Policy 30, Compensation and applies to non-represented employees only. It states: “An employee's total salary increase in a single fiscal year (including, for example, merit, promotional, and equity increases, but not including incentive awards) shall not exceed 25 percent of base salary, unless an exception is granted by the Chancellor." Our fiscal year starts on July 1st and goes through June 30th of the following year.  If you add 25% to your June 30th salary, that would indicate the maximum allowable salary you can achieve in the upcoming fiscal year.  For example: June 30th salary = $45,000 + 25% = $56,250 max salary. The only automatic exception to this is if an employee is being moved into another classification with a higher minimum salary that requires more than a 25% increase. OACIS-How do I check the status of a reclass review? Log into OACIS and click on Pending Actions. Find the Employee’s record and see what it says in the ‘Status’ column. This will indicate what stage the review is in. MERITS - How do I download my merit roster? At the bottom of the roster screen, click on “Select Download”. Select the appropriate download and click on the “Go” button. “Roster” and “Deletes” will be downloaded into Excel. “Roster Pdf” will create a PDF file of the roster. What is premium overtime? Premium overtime is time and one-half for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. Am I a represented or non-represented employee? (union vs. non-union)   Some of the staff positions at the University of California, based on job title classification, are organized into collective bargaining units that are exclusively represented by a union or employee organization. California's Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) gives UC employees the right to decide whether or not they want to unionize and have collective bargaining as the sole means of determining their wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.  There are thirteen collective bargaining units (CBU) on the UC Santa Barbara campus.  More information about HEERA and the collective bargaining process is available on the Office of the President’s collective bargaining web pages and at the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) web site.  PERB is the state agency responsible for oversight of HEERA and the collective bargaining process between the University and employee organizations/unions representing our employees. When you were hired, your hiring supervisor or the employment recruiter should have informed you if your position is part of a collective bargaining unit and represented by a union.  If you are uncertain, please ask your supervisor, department personnel coordinator or business officer.  You can also search the Salary Scales by job title classification to determine representation.  The Salary Scales indicate whether a job title classification falls into a specific unit by code. (The campus often uses these codes as an informal reference for the bargaining units, e.g, CX, SX, TX) If a position is not represented by a union, the job title/position is non-exclusively represented (often referred to by the code "99") and is covered by  Personnel Policies for Staff Members. OACIS - Is the OACIS system secure? Yes. The site uses the latest encryption technology to ensure that the information is secure. However, it is still important that all users log out after they use the system to ensure proper desktop security. In addition, if you are stepping away from your computer for a moment, we advise that you lock your workstation so others can not see your screen or access the system information. Is there any kind of bonus or incentive award program at UCSB? UCSB does not have any kind of bonus or incentive award program at this time. When do I submit a reclass versus an update? If you think that an update action on a job description might result in a change of title (be it lateral, upward or downward) please speak with your Compensation Analyst before starting any action. With any action it is important to consult your Analyst before submission, however, this situation is uniquely important due to the way the system is designed. Compensation does not have the ability to change the payroll title within an update action. The analyst's only option with an update is to continue the Job Description at the same title. If you do submit the Job Description as an update and the analyst determines that there should be a change in title the analyst will have to return the action to you for cancellation and you will then need to enter a brand new reclassification action instead. So the bottom line is, if there are any questions in your mind whether or not an action will result in a change of title, please speak with the analyst before you start an action. Can detailed time reporting records be kept for exempt employees for purposes other than compensation or salary? Yes, detailed records to the quarter hour can be kept for employees who charge a percentage of their salary to various grants or who are working on a number of accounts and the work charged to each account varies, or for other purposes, such as management reports, as long as the recording of time does not relate to pay. What is the difference between dual employment and multiple appointments? Dual employment occurs when an employee holds one 100% appointment and a second appointment. Multiple appointments occur when an employee does not hold a 100% appointment, but rather two or more appointments that are each less than 100%. How can I get a pay increase? Career employees may be eligible for a pay increase when: 1. their position gets reclassified upwards; 2. a significant inequity in salary exists (see Equity Guidelines) and the department chooses to rectify it (not required); 3. they are promoted (via recruitment) to another position on campus; 4. there is a campus merit program; or 5. there is a union negotiated increase. OACIS-How do I change the department code on a job description? The home department Begins a New Action (update, reclass, etc.) for the employee who’s job description needs a new department code. The home department saves the job description. The home department calls Human Resources (x4664) to change the department name. The OACIS administrator changes the department code. The OACIS administrator calls the new department to let them know they now have access to that job description and can finish performing the action on it.  Note:  Both departments need to agree to change the department code because once the department code has been changed the home department will no longer have access to that job description. The job description will still have the history associated with it.  However, as mentioned previously, the home department will not be able to perform actions on it nor have access to it.   How do I handle an employee who is at the salary range minimum? The web-based merit system will allow employees to receive a below-range merit, even if they continue to be below the minimum after the merit is applied. If this occurs, it is very important to remember to bring the employee to the minimum of the range after the web merit process is completed. Use action code ‘33’ (Manual Range Adjustment) when you process this action in PPS. OACIS - How do I obtain an OACIS Submitter or Reviewer account? Once you are logged into your OACIS account, click Create User Account on the left navigation bar under the heading USERS. Fill in the user’s employee ID number in the first field and also in the password field and confirm password field (this will prompt the user to change his/her password after logging in for the first time). Fill in the other fields on the form. Indicate in the Notes section what user type you are requesting. Click Continue at the bottom of the page. Click Confirm. Disability If an employee is on leave without pay the day before or after a holiday, does s/he get paid for the holiday? In general, a full-time non-exempt employee must be on pay status the day before the holiday and the first scheduled work day after the holiday to be eligible to receive compensation for the holiday.  An employee on an approved leave of absence without pay on the day before or the first scheduled work day after the holiday is considered to be on pay status and is eligible for the holiday pay.  Non-exempt employees who have been suspended for disciplinary reasons for a period that includes or immediately precedes or follows a holiday is not eligible for holiday pay for that holiday.  Non-exempt employees who have an unauthorized absence immediately preceding or following a holiday is also not eligible for holiday pay for that holiday.  Please consult PPSM Absence From Work or the applicable collective bargaining agreement for more information about holiday pay for full-time and part-time non-exempt employees.  Full-time Policy-covered exempt employees are eligible for holiday pay if they are on pay status during the week in which the holiday occurs.  Please consult the applicable collective bargaining agreement for information about holiday pay for represented exempt employees.  How do I apply for Liberty Mutual Disability benefits?

Once an employee mentions that they are taking leave for their own, or their family member's, serious health condition, the Supervisor or Department Representative should start the FML process. For the step-by-step process, forms and more information, please see the FML Supervisor/ Dept Duties section. How does FML benefit an employee? FML leave entitles eligible employees to take unpaid, job-protected leave for family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Job protection, continuation of the UC contribution to your health benefits for up to 12 weeks. Employees are also entitled to return to their same or an equivalent job at the end of their FML leave. Why do I need to provide the employee with FML if they have sick leave? Why is FML important? FML and sick leave run together. FML is the (unpaid) leave entitlement and sick leave is used to receive income.  UC is required by federal law to designate a qualifying leave as FML. Does an employee need to provide diagnosis of his/her serious health condition? No. Medical diagnosis is personal and private information. If someone voluntarily shares this information with you, it should be kept confidential. Are in-laws, step-parents, aunts, uncles or other extended family members covered by FML?

The Transitional Work Program (TWP) is a proactive approach to providing assistance to Academic, Staff and student employees who remain working or return to work when a medical condition or disability interferes with the ability to perform job duties.  Although employees with injuries and illnesses may be unable to perform their regular jobs, they can often do alternative productive work while recovering fully from injuries and illnesses. Oftentimes this alternative work simply involves a temporary restructuring of the employee's regular job. The TWP may provide temporary alternative work to employees who have suffered a work-related or non-industrial injury or illness that is consistent with the medical restrictions prescribed by their treating physician. When are you eligible for TWP? Employees with temporary partial disabilities, recovering from an industrial (work-related) or non-industrial injury/illness, are eligible for TWP assignments when they obtain written medical clearance from their treating physician who will specify  the employee's work restrictions. Where is the TWP Assignment? The Transitional Work Program Coordinator will try to place the employee in their home department by modifying the employee's job duties or providing alternate work. However, if a department is unable to provide work for an injured employee that is compatible with his/her restrictions and skills/abilities, the alternate assignment may be in another department. How do I get paid while on the TWP? If your transitional work assignment is full-time, you will receive your regular pay and benefits during your transitional assignment.  If you are on a reduced schedule (i.e. part-time), please see the Partial Disability: Stay at Work/ Return to Work Factsheet. How long is a typical TWP? Generally, a transitional work plan and/or agreement is for 30 days and are typically not longer than 90 days, however, TWP assignments are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may be extended if appropriate. What are my responsibilities as an employee requesting a reasonable accommodation? An employee's responbilities are to: Inform your supervisor of any difficulties you are having in performing your essential job duties because of a disability; Request a reasonable job accommodation; Provide medical documentation of your functional limitations and restrictions; Participate in the interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation. Please visit the Reasonable Accommodation section of the Disability website for more information. What happens if the reasonable accommodations don't work? If all the efforts to provide an employee with all other types of reasonable accommodations are unsuccessful, transfer or reassignment to another position that is open and vacant will be considered as an accommodation option.  This is called Special Selection, also known as the 90-Day Alternate Job Search. Who pays for equipment or other expenses required by a reasonable accommodation? The employee's department is responsible for these expenses. If the department is having difficulty defraying the expense, please contact the Disability Services Manager for options. What does "essential job functions" mean? Essential job functions are the basic job duties that an employee must be able to perform, with or without reasonable accommodations. What should an applicant for employment do to request a reasonable accommodation? Please contact the Employment Unit to request a reasonable accommodation. Does an employee have to use all of their sick/vacation days before being eligible for disability? No. Depending on your waiting period, if you have them you may be required to use up to 22 days of sick leave. You do not have to use vacation, but you can choose to do so during your waiting period to remain at full pay. My employee is on Liberty Mutual, what code should be entered in PPS?

FLSA - What happens if the employee’s appointments have different FLSA statuses (one appointment is non-exempt and one is exempt) in a dual employment situation? These situations require consultation and review by Human Resources, sometimes in collaboration with Academic Personnel. Please contact Compensation for assistance. I applied for a job but did not receive a confirmation number or my status is "incomplete". How can I confirm that I've completed the application process? Log in to OACIS with your user ID and password. On the Application Status screen, find the listing for the incomplete application. In the status column, beneath “Incomplete” click on the link that says Complete. Check for any required fields that are not filled in with an answer or with “N/A” (if the question does not apply to you). On the last page of the application make sure that you’ve checked the box certifying that all of the information in your application is true. Check the job posting to see if there are any required documents that you need to submit, such as a resume or cover letter. What happens when an employee completes probation? At the conclusion of the probationary period, the employee may receive written notification of the successful completion of the probationary period using the Probationary Period Report Form. The employee should receive a copy of the completed Probationary Period Report form. The original form should be filed in the employee’s departmental personnel file. (Human Resources does not retain a copy centrally.) Typically, new employees should also receive a written performance review at the mid-point and conclusion of the probationary period. Does time worked at another UC campus count towards the limited appointment clock? Limited appointment employees are restricted to working under 1000 hours in any rolling 12 month period - including hours worked at another UC campus. I have completed my application, and I've clicked "Apply for this Posting" for a specific postiion. Why is the "Submit" button not active? Check the job posting to see what additional documents are required, such as a resume and/or cover letter.  If there are required documents, you will need to attach them and then the Submit button will be active. DUAL EMP - Which DOS codes should be used to pay an employee with dual employment? The following DOS codes must be used to pay an employee with dual employment: a. DEE – For dual employment at a fixed dollar amount (exempt employees). b. DES – For dual employment at the straight-time rate (non-exempt employees). c. DEP – For dual employment at the premium (time and one-half) rate (non-exempt employees). Using these codes will ensure that employees are paid appropriately and will allow the University to track and report on these appointments. The same codes will be used in the PeopleSoft system to pay and track dual employment appointments after the University transitions to UCPath; however, they will be called Earnings codes rather than DOS codes. Why is OACIS not allowing me to advance to the next page of my application? Check that all of the required fields (designated by a red asterisk to the left of the field) have been filled in with either an answer or with “N/A” if the question does not apply to you.  OACIS will display a highlighted yellow column next to a required field that is blank,and there will be a message saying, “This is a required field. Please complete field before continuing.” How is an employee's probationary period calculated? In general, the probationary period ends six months from the starting date of employment.  The probationary period is based on actual days of work, so any holidays, sick, vacation or unpaid absences taken during the probationary period do not count towards the probationary period.   How should pay and overtime be addressed when an employee holds dual employment? Pay and overtime should be addressed in the following ways for dual employment situations: • If the employee is non-exempt, the employee must track all of the hours he/she works in each appointment and be paid overtime at the premium rate (1½ times the regular rate of pay) for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek (except for Police personnel, Hospital employees, and Firefighters – see PPSM 32 (Overtime), Section III.C.1-3). • If the employee is exempt, the employee does not track his/her hours and is paid a percentage of his/her base salary for the second appointment. The percentage will be determined based on the value of the work performed in the second appointment. How do I know that I've completed the application process? After submitting your application a confirmation number will be displayed on the screen. If you do not receive a confirmation number, your application was not submitted successfully, and you will not be considered for the position.  How long does the probationary period last?  Generally, a career employee is in a probationary status for the first six months of employment at UC Santa Barbara.   (Police Officers are on probationary status for one year.)  In some cases the probationary period may be extended up to three months.  Once an employee completes probation, s/he is a regular career status employee.  A career employee will not serve another probationary period unless s/he is re-hired after a break in service from University employment.  OACIS-How do I process a lateral transfer or lateral reclass? A Lateral Transfer is when one employee moves into another position of the same classification and level, usually a different budget provision.  A Lateral Reclass is when an employee moves into a different position with a different classification but same level (same salary max), and they usually take their budget provision with them. Processing a Lateral Transfer- The supervisor/manager submits an Update for the Job Description the employee is moving into.  They will need to fill out the Briefly explain the basis for updating this Job Description: field on the Action Justification tab, explaining the purpose for a Lateral Transfer. They will also need to send an email to the Employment Manager explaining what they are doing. Compensation will approve/deny the Update. Processing a Lateral Reclass- 1. The supervisor/manager submits a Reclass for the job description. 2. The Compensation Analyst follows the procedures for denying or approving a Reclass (no employment involvement is needed).

Are employees appointed to the Managers & Senior Professionals personnel group allowed to hold dual employment? Delegation of Authority 2070 states that dual employment may only be approved if the employee is appointed to a position in the Professional & Support Staff personnel group (see 2.a. above). Consequently, employees appointed to the Managers & Senior Professionals personnel group are not eligible to hold dual employment. Labor Relations What factors are consider in determining the need for a layoff or reduction in time? Layoffs and/or reductions in time for employees in career positions are implemented when there is a lack of funds or lack of work, including lack of work due to reorganization. What is an Unfair Labor Practice Charge or ULP? An Unfair Labor Practice charge or ULP is a charge filed with the California Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) that either the University or the exclusive bargaining agent (union) has violated the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA).  Where can I get more information on Collective Bargaining? You can find out more about the processes for elections, decertifications and the history of collective bargaining in the FAQ's on the UCOP Labor Relations Web site. What is a Tentative Agreement or "T.A." in contract negotiations? If an agreement is reached in collective bargaining negotiations between the University and the exclusive representative for a group of employees (aka union), it is called a Tentative Agreement or T.A. because it is not put into effect until each side has ratified (or voted to approve) it.  The Regents of the University of California ratify for the University and union members (generally voting rights are only extended to dues paying members of the union) vote to ratify for the union. Can an employee's probationary period be extended? An employee’s probationary status may be extended by an additional three months. Probationary employees must be advised, in writing, of the reasons for the extension before the probationary period ends.  A decision to extend probation requires review and approval by Employee & Labor Relations prior to implementation. What is a typical collective bargaining negotiation process? After a union is elected to represent a collective bargaining unit, the University and the union engage in a negotiation process to reach an agreement (or contract) on the terms and conditions of employment for represented members of the unit. Every agreement has a duration period, meaning that the agreement expires after a specific date and the parties have to negotiate a new agreement. This next negotiation process is called "successor" bargaining because the parties are negotiating for an agreement that will succeed the current one. In some cases, agreement includes a provision called "re-openers." This means that the parties have agreed that they will re-negotiate only certain portions, or Articles, even though the agreement does not expire until a future date.   What is impasse? If the University and the exclusive representative for a group of employees (aka union) are unable to reach an agreement through collective bargaining, negotiations may be declared at an impasse. This means that neither side is willing to compromise further on any of the outstanding issues. The State of California's Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) verifies whether or not the parties are at impasse and, if so, the State Mediation and Conciliation Services appoints an independent person to mediate between the parties.  If the mediator is unable to persuade the parties to compromise, then a fact-finding panel is created. Each party appoints one person to serve on the panel and PERB provides a list of independent arbitrators from which the parties mutually select one to chair the panel. This panel hears presentations from each side and then issues a fact-finding report.  However, the report is only advisory. If the parties are still unable to agree after the completion of fact-finding and the report is issued, the University is permitted to impose or unilaterally implement terms and conditions of employment, as long as such terms were “reasonably contemplated’ with the University’s last, best and final offer. Is a laid-off employee eligible for unemployment insurance? University employees are covered by unemployment insurance. Contact the California Employment Development Department for a determination of eligibility. What is PERB?   The State of California's Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) is the administrative agency charged with implementing and overseeing the provisions of HEERA. PERB makes determinations about which units are appropriate for collective bargaining; conducts elections to determine whether employees in a given unit want to be unionized and engage in collective bargaining; and investigates, holds hearings, and makes decisions on whether or not unfair labor practices have been committed.  What is the "sunshine period" in the collective bargaining process? After the University and exclusive representative for a group of employees (aka union) submits a notice of intent to bargain and exchange initial proposals, the initial proposals are made available for public viewing at a stated time and place prior to the start of negotiations.   This allows the general public an opportunity to review and comment on initial proposals.  What is HEERA?   California's Higher Education Employee Employer Relations Act (HEERA) is the law passed by the California State Legislature that governs labor relations between public institutions of higher education and their employees.  HEERA gives UC employees the right to decide whether or not they want to unionize and have collective bargaining as the sole means of determining their wages, hours and working conditions. What are "initial proposals" in the collective bargaining process? The exclusive representative for a group of employees (aka union) and the University develop and present initial proposals to each side prior to the start of collective bargaining negotiations. The initial proposals are generally changes or new contract provisions that each side would like to achieve through negotiations. What will happen with accumulated sick leave when an employee is laid-off? Accumulated sick leave will not be paid. If the laid-off employee has preferential rehire and recall rights and is re-employed during the preferential rehire period, all accumulated sick leave from prior service is reinstated upon rehire. If the employee does not have preference and recall and is re-employed after a break in service of less than 15 calendar days, all sick leave from prior service is reinstated. If the employee is re-employed after a break in service of 15 calendar days or more, but less than 6 months, up to 80 hours of sick leave are reinstated. What happens when an employee completes probation? At the conclusion of the probationary period, the employee may receive written notification of the successful completion of the probationary period using the Probationary Period Report Form. The employee should receive a copy of the completed Probationary Period Report form. The original form should be filed in the employee’s departmental personnel file. (Human Resources does not retain a copy centrally.) Typically, new employees should also receive a written performance review at the mid-point and conclusion of the probationary period. Who must pay an agency fee? If a position is covered by an exclusive representative (union) and the represented employee is not a registered member of a union to which s/he pays union dues, the employee is required by law to pay an agency fee. What is Collective Bargaining? Collective bargaining is a bilateral decision-making process involving direct negotiations, in which the University and the exclusive representative of the employees (usually called a “union”) determine wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment for all employees in the bargaining unit.  During this process, the parties meet and exchange proposals and counter-proposals.  Pursuant to the Higher Education Employer Employee Relations Act (HEERA), the parties are required to meet and negotiate in good faith (fairly consider the proposals of the opposing side and not dismiss them outright) and prohibits the parties from engaging in regressive bargaining (making their proposals or counter-proposals worse than prior proposals).   What is a collective bargaining agreement or union contract or memorandum of understanding? Collective bargaining agreement, union contract and memorandum of understanding (MOU) are all terms that refer to a written, mutually binding agreement that results from direct negotiations between the University and the exclusive representative for a group of employees.  The agreement, contract or MOU sets wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment for an agreed-upon period of time. What will happen with accumulated vacation leave in a layoff? Any accumulated vacation earned through the last day of employment will be paid upon separation. What is the difference between "Fair Share," "Agency Shop" and "Agency Fee?" There is no difference.  Fair share, agency shop and agency fee are the same thing. PERB has adopted  the phase "Agency Fee" to refer to a represented employee's obligation to pay representational costs to the union where the employee declines to become a dues paying member of the union. What is the effect of layoff on other UC benefits such as AD&D insurance, short-term disability and UC Retirement Plan (UCRP)? For information pertaining to these benefits, review Indefinite Layoff - UCnet Resources or the Benefits Checklist: Temporary Layoff.  For information about your health and welfare benefits.  Contact the Benefits Office if you have additional questions (805-893-2489). How is an employee's probationary period calculated? In general, the probationary period ends six months from the starting date of employment.  The probationary period is based on actual days of work, so any holidays, sick, vacation or unpaid absences taken during the probationary period do not count towards the probationary period.   What is "Agency Fee?" The phrase "Agency Fee" refers to the union's ability to collect money from employees to pay for things such as negotiating a contract and representing employees in grievances and arbitrations, and lobbying activities to foster collective bargaining negotiations or secure advocates. What does 'status quo' mean for collective bargaining units?  Generally, when a collective bargaining agreement expires and no new agreement has been reached, the University is required to maintain the status quo for terms and conditions of employment affecting represented employees in that unit.  “Status quo” is a legal term for the University’s obligation to generally maintain the same wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment that existed prior to the agreement’s expiration.  Thus, once an agreement has expired, the University usually cannot make changes to terms and conditions without giving notice to the employee’s union and potentially negotiating the change.  Management actions that may require a notice/negotiation obligation include: reclassifications, transfers, involuntary changes in employee’s hours, changes in departmental procedures related to ability to accrue comp time in lieu of overtime, scheduling overtime, vacation, taking sick leave, and other work rule changes.        Notably, not everything related to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment is subject to bargaining or to “status quo.”  However, departments planning to make changes affecting employees in bargaining units now in status quo should contact the appropriate Employee and Labor Relations Specialist to review plans and coordinate any required notices prior to implementing any such changes.  What is the effect of layoff on an employee’s medical, dental and vision benefits? For information pertaining to these benefits, review Indefinite Layoff - UCnet Resources or the Benefits Checklist: Temporary Layoff.  For information about your health and welfare benefits.  Contact the Benefits Office if you have additional questions (805-893-2489). How long does the probationary period last?  Generally, a career employee is in a probationary status for the first six months of employment at UC Santa Barbara.   (Police Officers are on probationary status for one year.)  In some cases the probationary period may be extended up to three months.  Once an employee completes probation, s/he is a regular career status employee.  A career employee will not serve another probationary period unless s/he is re-hired after a break in service from University employment.  What is an out-of-seniority layoff? In some situations, less senior employees (determined by amount of service with the University) in the affected classification may be retained based upon special skills, knowledge or abilities that are not possessed by other employees in the same classification and that are necessary to maintain the operations of the department.  Requests for out-of-seniority layoff must be reviewed and approved by Employee & Labor Relations. When is an employee on probation? Generally, a career employee is in a probationary status for the first six months of employment at UC Santa Barbara.   (Police Officers are on probationary status for one year.)  In some cases, the probationary period may be extended up to three months.  Once an employee completes probation, s/he is a regular career status employee.  A career employee will not serve another probationary period unless s/he is re-hired after a break in service from University employment.  How is seniority calculated for the purposes of a layoff? Seniority for the purposes of a layoff is calculated by full-time equivalent months (or hours) of University service in any job classification or title. Employment prior to a break in service (separation from employment status) shall not be counted.  What is a collective bargaining unit or CBU? Under the California Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA), a collective bargaining unit is a group of job positions/job titles with a sufficient "community of interest" that a union can reasonably represent the employees in the unit - particularly the negotiation of the employees' terms and conditions of employment.  HEERA provides that, with some exceptions, collective bargaining units at the University are organized into systemwide units. This means that all employees in a specific collective bargaining unit, across all the UC campuses, are considered to be one unit. Other units (Skilled Crafts units for example) are considered a local, single campus unit.   If an employee elects severance, does this affect the right to recall and preferential rehire rights? In general, represented employees may elect either severance or right to recall and preferential rehire rights.  Non-represented employees may elect right to recall and preference for re-employment in lieu of severance. Contact the Employment Office at 805-893-4662, to determine what effect the election of severance will have on an employee’s right to recall and preferential rehire. Will I lose pay if I'm simply absent from work during a strike? If an employee does not report to work as assigned during a strike, UC will presume — absent prior authorization or medical certification — that her/his work absence during a strike period is strike related. Employees who are absent from work without authorization during a strike will not be paid for the absence. As is always the case, authorization for an absence from work (e.g., vacation leave or compensatory time) may or may not be granted, depending on operational necessity and without regard to the employee's reason for the requested leave. Am I a represented or non-represented employee? (union vs. non-union)   Some of the staff positions at the University of California, based on job title classification, are organized into collective bargaining units that are exclusively represented by a union or employee organization. California's Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) gives UC employees the right to decide whether or not they want to unionize and have collective bargaining as the sole means of determining their wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.  There are thirteen collective bargaining units (CBU) on the UC Santa Barbara campus.  More information about HEERA and the collective bargaining process is available on the Office of the President’s collective bargaining web pages and at the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) web site.  PERB is the state agency responsible for oversight of HEERA and the collective bargaining process between the University and employee organizations/unions representing our employees. When you were hired, your hiring supervisor or the employment recruiter should have informed you if your position is part of a collective bargaining unit and represented by a union.  If you are uncertain, please ask your supervisor, department personnel coordinator or business officer.  You can also search the Salary Scales by job title classification to determine representation.  The Salary Scales indicate whether a job title classification falls into a specific unit by code. (The campus often uses these codes as an informal reference for the bargaining units, e.g, CX, SX, TX) If a position is not represented by a union, the job title/position is non-exclusively represented (often referred to by the code "99") and is covered by  Personnel Policies for Staff Members. What is the difference between a right to recall and a right to recall or preference for re-employment? In most cases, an employee who has been laid off or indefinitely reduced in time shall be recalled in order of seniority into any active and vacant career position for which the employee is qualified, when the position is in the same class and the same department at the same or lesser percent of time as the position held at the time of layoff. Preference for re-employment is generally applicable to any active and vacant career position at the same campus, the same or lower salary grade, and at the same or lesser percent of time, provided the employee is qualified for the position.  If I join a strike, will I lose pay or benefits? You will not be paid if you fail to report for work as scheduled.  In additions, your benefits may be affected depending on the percentage of time worked in a particular pay period.  Please refer to the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. What is an investigatory leave?   In certain serious circumstances, an employee may be placed on an investigatory leave to allow the University time to review or investigate the allegations without the employee in the workplace.   The purpose of the leave is to allow the University time to investigate the allegations or secure the worksite during an investigation.  Potential allegations of misconduct warranting an investigatory leave include but are not limited dishonesty, theft or misappropriation of University property, fighting on the job, insubordination, acts endangering others, or other conduct which warrants removing the employee from the work site. In general, employees must be informed in writing of the reason and the expected duration of the leave.  If you have questions about investigatory leave, please contact  Employee & Labor Relations .      Is severance provided to employees affected by layoff? Refer to the Personnel Policies for Staff Members (PPSM) or the applicable collective bargaining agreements to find out whether severance pay is available. Contact Employee & Labor Relations at 805-893-4119 if you have additional questions. If my union calls for a strike, am I obligated to strike? No employee is ever obligated to strike. Unions are legally prohibited from threatening or coercing members in other ways to keep them from coming to work. Some unions can fine dues-paying members (but not non-members) for working during a strike. A union member who does not want to strike may contact her/his union directly to inquire about possible fines. UC will not deduct fines from an employee’s paycheck. How do I cancel payment of union dues? If you no longer wish to pay dues or have been transferred or promoted out of a bargaining unit, you will need to complete the Membership Payroll Deduction Authorization Form  Union dues will continue to be taken out of your paycheck even if you are no longer in a represented title unless you submit the signed form canceling payment of dues.  Please complete the requested information, mark the section under "Cancel" and mail the signed form to Debra Martin, Human Resources, Mail Code 3160.  If you are still in a represented title, you will still have to pay agency fees even if you elect to stop paying union dues.  More information about dues and fees is available here.  Is reduction in time considered a layoff? Yes. If a career employee’s time is involuntarily reduced, it is considered a layoff, and the employee is entitled to layoff rights. What is a strike? A work stoppage by a group of employees intended to express a grievance, enforce a demand for higher wages or for other changes in conditions of employment, obtain recognition, or resolve a dispute with management. I noticed recently my employee is often late and/or is frequently taking sick days. What should I do? Talk to your employee about what you have observed. If the employee is eligible, inform him/her of their right to take Family & Medical Leave. Do NOT ask for diagnosis. If they continue to take frequent sick days and have not provided medical documentation, contact Disability Services and/or Employee & Labor Relations. PPS + UC Path How do I handle an employee who is close to or at the salary range maximum? The system will allow you to merit an employee up to the range maximum only, so it may revise your original entry. MERIT - What determines an employee’s eligibility for a merit increase? Eligibility requirements will vary according to the contract or policy. Please refer to the guidelines and procedures for the specific merit population. MERITS - How do I get my own merit entered, if I’m the department preparer? Please make every effort to have someone else enter your merit rating and salary increase. “Someone else” can either be another preparer in your department, a department chair with an account, or a control point. If it is absolutely not possible for another person to enter it, then you may enter your own, but you should follow through with documentation to your control point. An example of documentation could be an email to the control point with a copy going to the department chair. Your control point may give you further instructions on this topic. Note that all “self-updates” are marked with a flag in the system and will be reviewed at the end of the process. MERITS - What do I enter for the performance evaluation rating and date? Performance ratings are entered as 1, 2, 3, 4 or X. 1 = Demonstrates a high degree of expertise and mastery in all aspects of the position in a professional manner. 2 = Fully performs the entire range of duties in a professional manner. 3 = Generally performs essential duties satisfactorily. 4 = Does not perform essential duties in a satisfactory manner. X = No written performance evaluation has been done. Date format is MM/YY, and it cannot be later than the current month. If using “X” as a performance rating, enter the current month (MM/YY). NOTE: Performance evaluations should take place sometime during the twelve months prior to the merit effective date. Does time worked at another UC campus count towards the limited appointment clock? Limited appointment employees are restricted to working under 1000 hours in any rolling 12 month period - including hours worked at another UC campus. RECLASS - How do I handle an employee with a temporary reclassification or stipend? Only the permanent position can be merited during the web merit process, although both will appear on rosters. As long as the temporary reclassification or stipend shows up on a separate roster line, you’ll be able to delete that temporary line from the roster without disrupting the permanent position (this is an example of an appropriate use of the delete function). Keep in mind that the two lines may appear on two different departments’ rosters. Later, follow your usual process on requesting rate increases for temporary reclassifications and stipends (if appropriate) – request control point approval, then contact HR Compensation with the approved request. How do I get an account to enter merits for my department? Use the "Request for Access to PPS" form on Accounting's web site: http://accounting.ucsb.edu/Forms/view.cfm?form=cs-pps-access-request For specific access account questions, please call LoAn Piela in Accounting at x2880. MERITS - When should I delete an employee from the roster? Deleting an employee from the roster should be a rare occurrence. If an ineligible employee appears on the preliminary roster, you may need to correct some data fields in PPS to ensure that employee does not appear on the final roster. If an ineligible employee still appears on the final roster, then it might be appropriate to delete the employee from the roster. Otherwise eligible employees who are not receiving a merit increase (e.g., due to an unsatisfactory performance rating) should remain on the roster so that funds generated by their presence are left in the pool of available dollars. This is important for balancing the total amount spent against the overall control figure. MERITS - What do I do if someone is missing from my roster? During the preliminary roster stage, departments should determine whether an eligible employee is missing from the roster and make the necessary corrections in PPS, before the final roster is created. See the previous question/answer above to help determine what fields may need to be adjusted in PPS. If an employee is missing from the final roster, you will not be able to add him to the roster. Wait until the web process is completed to enter his new rate to PPS manually, using Action Code ‘04’. Along with processing this action in PPS, an email or memo must be sent to Human Resources stating the employee’s performance rating. MERITS - How can I determine why an employee is included in the roster? On the roster screen, click on the employee’s name in order to see what data was present in PPS at the time of the roster “snapshot”. An employee is selected for the roster based on the data present in a number of fields on PPS. Important fields in PPS that are used in employee selection include: Screen Field Data needed to indicate merit eligibility EAPP Appointment Type ‘2’ (Career) or ‘7’ (Partial-Year Career) EAPP Distribution End Date At least one distribution needs to end on or after the merit effective date EPER Next Salary Review Date Needs to be the merit effective date or earlier EPER Next Salary Review Type Should display ‘2’ or ‘3’, as appropriate EPER Employee Relations Code Needs to reflect appropriate code MERITS - How do I download my merit roster? At the bottom of the roster screen, click on “Select Download”. Select the appropriate download and click on the “Go” button. “Roster” and “Deletes” will be downloaded into Excel. “Roster Pdf” will create a PDF file of the roster. How do I handle an employee who is at the salary range minimum? The web-based merit system will allow employees to receive a below-range merit, even if they continue to be below the minimum after the merit is applied. If this occurs, it is very important to remember to bring the employee to the minimum of the range after the web merit process is completed. Use action code ‘33’ (Manual Range Adjustment) when you process this action in PPS. What is the order of salary adjustments that have the same effective date? In general, if more than one salary adjustment takes place on the same date, actions occur in the following order: 1. Merit increases or, if applicable, salary increases for employees who hold temporary appointments; 2. Salary action resulting from promotion, reclassification, transfer, demotion, or equity adjustment; and 3. Salary range adjustment (if applicable). What leave bundle in PPS should be entered for an employee off work for Workers' Compensation? You will receive an email with specific direction from Workers' Compensation. You can also review the How to Update PPS section of the Disability website. My employee is on Liberty Mutual, what code should be entered in PPS? The employee is LNS for any hours that are paid by Liberty Mutual. Please visit the How to update PPS section of the Disability website for instructions on entering temporary and/or partial Disability Leaves (i.e. reduced schedule).
