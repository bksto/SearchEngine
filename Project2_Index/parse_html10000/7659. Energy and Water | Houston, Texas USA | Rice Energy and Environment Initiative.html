It's no secret that clean, abundant supplies of energy and water are needed to both avoid economic scarcity and to safeguard the environment. Yet the direct relationship between water and energy -- the water-energy nexus -- cannot be understated.    Rice will apply its world-class expertise in energy policy, nanotechnology, materials science, energy humanities, water treatment and more to create a center of excellence to focus on the water-energy nexus. Research areas include:  Improving development of reserves (for example, reservoir souring and corrosion). Safety in use, reuse and treatment. Increasing challenges and costs of water acquisition, treatment and desalination. Regulatory uncertainty and requirements. Market mechanisms to drive conservation. Beneficial disposition of produced waters. Public understanding and education. Rice is poised to create the means and methods for minimizing the water footprint of energy and vice versa. Our vision is to enable sustainable water management and on-site treatment and reuse, including zero-liquid discharge, in ways that are safe, reliable, modular, versatile and cost-effective.
