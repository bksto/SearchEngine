Professor Liou accepted the Medal on December 11, 2013 at the AGU fall meeting in San Francisco and gave an acceptance speech to an audience of more than 2000. Distinguished Alumnus Award from National Taiwan University "in the category of academic achievement." Professor Liou is the  first Earth scientist so honored by NTU. He accepted the award at NTU in Taipei on November 15, 2013.   Assistant Professor Jonathan Mitchell 2013 Ronald Greeley Early Career Award  Jonathan L. Mitchell received the 2013 Ronald Greeley Early Career Award in Planetary Science at the 2013 AGU Fall Meeting, held 9–13 December in San Francisco. The award recognizes significant early-career contributions to planetary science. The Greeley Early Career Award is named for pioneering planetary scientist Ronald Greeley.   2012-2013 Academic Year Faculty Awards: Distinguished Research Professor; Emeritus Akio Arakawa Honorary Fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society: The Royal Meteorological Society has a small number of Honorary Fellows who are elected by Council. This is the highest recognition the Society can give for a distinguished service to meteorology. "The most widely influential of Arakawa's works in the context of global warming and climate change has been the parameterization for AGCMs of the effect of clouds generated by convection."   Associate Professor Curtis Deutsch Moore Foundation Marine Microbiology Investigator Award: The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, established in 2000, seeks to advance environmental conservation, patient care and scientific research. The Science Program’s Marine Microbiology Initiative strives to deepen our understanding of marine microbial communities. As the smallest and most abundant organisms in the Earth’s oceans, marine microorganisms play a critical role in maintaining the oceans’ health and productivity.   Professor Rob Fovell Fellow of American Meterological Society: Election as a Fellow of AMS is an honor bestowed upon members by their peers. Fellows are recognized for meritorious efforts to advance science or its applications.   Professor J. David Neelin Fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU): Only one in a thousand members is elected to Fellowship each year for their fundamental contributions to science. David Neelin was honored in person at the December 2012 Fall AGU Meeting in San Francisco. He joins 6 other department faculty as an AGU Fellow: Michael Ghil, Kuo-Nan Liou, Larry Lyons, Jim McWilliams, Richard Thorne and Rich Turco.   Assistant Professors Jonathan Mitchell and Aradhna Tripati Hellman Fellow: The fellowship was established in 1994 at UC San Diego and UC Berkeley to encourage the research of promising Assistant Professors who show capacity for great distinction in their research. Fellowships are given without regard to the apparent timeliness or popularity of the field of study. More than 650 UC faculty are Hellman Fellows, across 9 UC campuses. UCLA's Hellman Fellows Program was established in 2011.     2011-2012 Academic Year Postoctoral Awards: Lunjin Chen, Postdoctoral Scholar Fred Scarf Award (American Geophysical Union): The F. L. Scarf Award was established in 1989 by the AGU’s Space Physics and Aeronomy Section to recognize an outstanding dissertation that contributes directly to solar-planetary science. The award was presented at the SPA dinner at the 2012 Fall AGU Meeting, at which Lunjin Chen presented the Scarf Award lecture (an invited talk)   Faculty Awards: Professor Rob Fovell American Meteorological Society Teaching Excellence Award: Given annually to an individual in recognition of sustained outstanding teaching and mentoring at the undergraduate and/or graduate levels and for the impact this individual has had on students.   Distinguished Research Professor Michael Ghil Alfred Wegener Medal (European Geosciences Union): Recipients are chosen based not only on the merits of their scientific achievements, but also on their standing and regard within the international community. Just one scientist is chosen each year.   Professor Kuo-Nan Liou Quadrennial Gold Medal (International Radiation Commission (IRC)): Given for contributions of lasting significance to the field of radiation research in August 2012, during the commission’s 2012 Symposium in Berlin. The commission was founded in 1896 under the auspices of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. J. David Neelin Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science: The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the world’s largest general scientific society and the publisher of the journal Science. Members are chosen for their distinguished efforts to advance science or its applications. The tradition of AAAS fellows began in 1874. New fellows were honored at the February 2012 AAAS annual meeting in Vancouver, B.C., Canada and announced in the AAAS News & Notes section of the journal Science on December 23rd.
