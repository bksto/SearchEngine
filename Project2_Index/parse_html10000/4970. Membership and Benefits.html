The primary reason to join the Alumni Association is pride in your university. Association members are those that have indicated that they want to stay connected to The Beach for life. The Alumni Association is a major supporter of many university programs and works hard to make sure that students of today and tomorrow know what pride and tradition is all about. With over 265,000 graduates, our members stand out as those who are committed to being a part of the university even after graduation. As a card-carrying member, you also have access to special benefits that non-members do not. Membership for graduates is a one-time $49 fee! Graduates never have to renew their membership. Not a graduate of CSULB? You can join too! We invite parents, faculty, staff, emeriti and friends of the university to become members as well. Associate members (attended but did not graduate from CSULB) and Affiliate members (friends of the university) join for $49 and renew at $25 annually.   Membership Benefits New Benefits!
