These policies and procedures are issued by the Provost and Executive Vice President of Academic Affairs and published in the Academic Personnel Manual (APM).  The Policy Development Process is designed to insure that APM policies undergo comprehensive review and meet certain standards.  Academic appointees subject to policies and procedures within the APM include, but are not limited to, faculty such as Professorial Rank Faculty, Lecturers and Clinical Faculty; academic research professionals such as Professional Researchers and Specialists; academic service professionals such as Librarians and Cooperative Extension Specialists and Advisors; and graduate student employees such as Research and Teaching Assistants. For academic appointees covered by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the APM applies only to the extent provided for in the MOU. Academic Personnel and Programs maintains the official copy of the APM, including the online version of the APM and any subsequent changes.  Questions about maintaining the APM may be directed to Janet Lockwood. Specific academic personnel policy questions from those located at a University of California campus may be directed to the local Academic Personnel Office.
