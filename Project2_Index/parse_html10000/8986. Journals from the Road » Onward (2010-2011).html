But they particularly describe the perpetual movement of our students as they achieve their academic goals. The college experience seems to pass ever so quickly and then our graduates move onward. In this series we will present the stories of some of our recent graduates who are moving on as many before them have. Here we will offer their perspectives on their early steps away from the Hilltop and onward to first jobs or graduate school.   Public relations in St. Louis By Bethany Doty ’10 After 16 years of school, countless hours spent in class, and numerous life changes, I have recently made my biggest transition. My educational experience in the classroom has come to an end, but I have entered a new period of growth and learning. I no longer sit in a classroom frantically taking notes as the professor lectures. This has been replaced by hours in an office spent preparing work for clients. Late nights in the library cramming for exams with the help of coffee are now replaced by early bedtimes and a morning cup of coffee. Change can often make an individual feel uncertain about what is next. Fortunately, I have never felt so prepared for my “next step.”  The transition to the real world has been a smooth process and I credit this to my experience at Bradley University. My life after Bradley finds me in downtown St. Louis as a post-grad intern at Fleishman-Hillard.  In an uncertain economy, a job offer is not taken for granted. I am so grateful for the opportunity to work alongside some of the best public relations professionals in the world at a globally renowned firm. In the middle of January I left sweet home Chicago for life in St. Louis. I have a strong tie to Chicago, but life in St. Louis is showing me there are opportunities out there if you put forth the effort to look. I am an intern in the Public Affairs group at Fleishman-Hillard where I have been able to jump into a variety of projects for many different clients. My first month as an intern has been busy. The days fly by as I move from project to project. By the time 5:00 p.m. rolls around, it feels like I have only been in the office for an hour. I feel well prepared to complete the project work, which is a direct reflection on my educational experience at Bradley. My communications classes and the many projects associated with PR allowed me to gain valuable real-world experience before entering the working environment. I am so thankful to have been taught at a university that challenged me and pushed me to produce my best work all the time. I know this is just the beginning and I have so much more to learn. I am excited to see the growth I will experience in the next few months at Fleishman. It is a privilege to work with individuals who are extremely talented and are excellent role models for the next generation of communicators. There is not a doubt in my mind that Bradley was the right school for me. I am truly blessed to have this opportunity in my life. Each day presents a chance to learn and grow. March 3rd, 2011 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Success on an uncertain path By Jacob Cohen ’10 The real world for me started as soon as my name was announced at graduation, shook President Glasser’s hand, and sat back down. As a theatre major your career path isn’t always stable and you don’t always know what’s next. In the Bradley theatre program, students are required to take a junior/senior seminar class that prepares them for the “real world.” We talk to alumni who have gone straight to grad school or jumped right into the acting business. I knew that I didn’t want to go straight into grad school, so I started looking for successful working theatres where I could get an internship. Through research, I came across the Chicago Children’s Theatre. While interning there, I primarily worked in the development section of the office, dealing with grants, donation letters, fund raising, and special events, which was all very new to me. I also helped with the re-mount of the very successful run of “The Hundred Dresses” in Skokie, Illinois. Toward the end of my internship, Jacqui Russell, the artistic director, asked me if I wanted to be a part of “Red Kite Round Up.” I immediately hopped on board because I had prior experience working with kids with disabilities. “Red Kite Round Up” is a multi-sensory, virtual camping trip designed especially for children with autism to explore and celebrate their impulses in a theatrical setting. My role in the show is a teaching assistant, and I was also appointed to be the caretaker of a cast member who is on the autism spectrum. Each day at Red Kite Round Up, I make sure he gets dressed, completes his pre-show responsibilities, knows his jokes of the day, and I stay with him during the performance to assist him with his onstage responsibilities. At first, he was a little hesitant to do all this on his own, but recently has been stepping up and doing things on his own and without my guidance. Being a part of the show is truly a blessing! Every performance is different because we have many kids with different forms of autism and each child has specific behavior quirks, focuses, and fears. They’re always a joy to work with, though they are frequently taken out of their comfort zone. I learn just as much from the kids as they learn from me. This opportunity to allow kids to follow their impulses and explore their surroundings is what makes my fellow cast members and me love our job even more! February 17th, 2011 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments I didn’t apply for a job, I created one By Suswara Gayam ’10 When you graduate, you take pictures to capture the milestone, you reflect on the memories that led you to that point, and you accept congratulations from your family, friends and mentors. Then panic sets in. You find yourself free falling with anxiety. Well-meant advice that “this is the first day of the rest of your life” really is anything but therapeutic. Since the beginning of my collegiate career, I have changed my major and relocated four times. So when I transferred to Bradley in 2008, I was beginning to think that I would never be sure of, well, anything. I loved to be challenged, to lead and to learn – that, I knew. Through my education I completed three internships within the engineering and finance industries, and was even offered multiple jobs upon my December 2010 graduation. I underwent intensive screening and interviewing processes that only made me realize working for “the man” was not the right fit for me. During my senior year I had the opportunity to enter the Springboard Business Plan Competition. After being awarded first place, I realized that the most valuable prize of the competition was discovering a passion for entrepreneurship that defined the direction of my career – a discovery that changed my life. I am now a full-time entrepreneur. Though the film “The Social Network” is an unrealistic and glamorous depiction of my everyday life, I can testify that being an entrepreneur does not mean you are unemployed. My team and I work rigorously to pinpoint and develop scalable, repeatable businesses through execution and iteration. Following lean start-up frameworks has allowed us to give due diligence to primary research, which will theoretically save an unquantifiable amount of time, funds and energy in the future. My team and I are exploring multiple web and mobile platform business models to test for a minimum viable product very soon. A day in the life of a budding entrepreneur includes cold calling, customer development, internal/external meetings, road mapping, outreach, strategic partnerships/alliances, documentation, vertical exploration and (of course) networking. Being your own boss is a responsibility and lifestyle new college graduates tend to avoid. Most graduates like structure, classic nine-to-five days, and a steady paycheck. Being part of an organization such as the Bradley Speech Team allowed me to refine my academic and professional passions to realize that was not the path for me. Having an incredible support system from my biological and Speech Team family, encouraged me to take a risk, and I did. I am forever grateful for the academic and professional experiences I gained at Bradley that prompted me to search deeper to self-define success. In a recessionary economy, I urge my peers to never undermine their talent and empower themselves to make jobs rather than applying for them. I am learning so much about the fast-paced tech industry every day and, though relatively new to the field, I can already attest that entrepreneurs are similar in breed. We are lifelong problem solvers and field scholars. Entrepreneurship is both trying and thrilling but most definitely fulfilling. February 4th, 2011 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Taking a chance to change the world By Ben Koch ’10 What does one do with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English?   Simple. Move to Las Vegas to change the world. A year ago, I began to explore options for life after graduation. I was blessed with many opportunities at Bradley and was prepared to take the next step and become a productive member of society. In the end, it wasn’t an opportunity to study at a prestigious graduate school or a promising job offer that won me over. Instead, it was the opportunity to make a difference. In April, I was offered a position teaching seventh grade English language arts for the Clark County School District in the Las Vegas valley. The opportunity came through Teach For America, the national corps of top recent college graduates, who commit to teach for two years in urban and rural public schools and become lifelong leaders in the effort to expand educational opportunity. As a Teach for America corps member, each day I work toward their vision – “One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.” My placement is at a Title I school that serves a large percentage of students who receive free or reduced-price lunches based upon family income. The Clark County School District serves more than 300,000 students and is the fifth largest school district in the nation. The educational outlook for students in Nevada is difficult, as the state ranked 48th of 50 states on the 2008 Report Card of American Education. The 2006 Nevada graduation rate was just over 54 percent. The national graduation average for the same year was over 70 percent. This week I’m wrapping up my first semester as a teacher. It’s been a semester of lessons learned, challenges and victories. I’m excited to report that many of my seventy students are on track to meet the classroom “Big Goal” of growing two or more reading levels in one school year. This hasn’t been easy. Hours have been long, emotions have run high and tears have been shed. The work of ensuring success for all students is not for the faint-hearted. Frequently, I’m up by 5:00 a.m. and find myself nodding to sleep when 9:00 p.m. rolls around – definitely a change from college when study sessions and meetings were only beginning at that time. I juggle the responsibilities of planning two lessons daily that must align to state and national standards. In addition, I am working on a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. A typical day consists of being at school from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The rest of the day could be spent grading papers, planning lessons, attending graduate classes, working on my homework, reading young adult novels to recommend for my students, or participating in the lively and colorful culture of Las Vegas. I have no doubt that my experiences at Bradley have prepared me to be successful in whatever challenges I face. Each day the blessed responsibility of teaching and the hopes I have for my students’ future become real when they walk into the classroom. Each lesson is an opportunity for them to learn. Each opportunity is a chance for them to defy the odds stacked against them. Each day is another chance to change the world. January 27th, 2011 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Fostering business nationwide By Andrew Kistner ’10 The dream of entering the real world is something a kid thinks about every summer when he or she begins to dread the beginning of school. Most of the time I thought to myself, “Why can’t I be a grown-up and not have to go to school?”…little did I know. This so called aspiration has become a reality, and gone are the days of studying for exams on the weekend –  or every other day for that matter – spending countless hours in the library working on a variety of projects, and procrastinating on Facebook for hours at a time. Now are the days of catching the 7:35 a.m. Metra into the hustle and bustle of the city for work, collecting a paycheck higher than minimum wage, and not paying tuition, or repaying it – yet.  No longer are my days full of free time. Instead, the workday stretches from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., five days a week. After graduating in December, my career began Monday, January 3, 2011, in Chicago, Illinois, at MSDSonline.  The questions of, “What are you going to do when you graduate?” have turned into, “What do you do at MSDSonline?” MSDSonline is based in the heart of downtown Chicago, right on the Chicago River. The company, which began in 1996, partners with businesses across much of North America associated with mandated regulatory safety standards. It offers a multitude of products to assist manufacturers, hospitals, school districts, etc. to meet governmental standards through online management. I work directly with the potential customers who can use our products. My day begins around 8:45 when I begin to prospect customers in my West Coast district and qualify potential customers. Throughout the day, I call on these leads, discussing their current management system and the benefits of allowing an outside resource to manage these requirements via the Internet. For the next six months I will work alongside a mentor, working to develop a pipeline for when I graduate from my sales training role in June. At that time I will use the skills I develop in training and will grow within the company as my pipeline prospers. In my short time with the company, I have realized a person’s success in the sales world comes from the time put in at the office. While my work day is from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., much of my mornings and evenings will be filled with lead prospecting to ensure my success in the sales world. I am eager to continue my growth beyond Bradley.  I am happy to say my move to the city of Chicago and job at MSDSonline could not have come at a better time. Leaving Bradley University and my hometown of Peoria was a challenge, but a necessary step as one of the newest alums taking knowledge from school and applying it in the real world. January 21st, 2011 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Uncovering the truth about law school By Melissa Hoffman ’10 Graduation day from Bradley University was bittersweet. I was happy to graduate and proud of my accomplishments, but I was also anxious because I would start law school in August at Southern Illinois University School of Law. I didn’t know what law school would be like, so I watched the movie “Legally Blonde” and read the book “1L” by Scott Turow in an attempt to prepare myself. I entered law school August 18 for a three-day orientation period. I met my classmates and professors and learned what classes would be like. Thankfully, orientation prepared me for the rigors of law school much more than “Legally Blonde.” Law school has a reputation for being extremely competitive. I had heard stories of law students who stole classmates’ textbooks and refused to share notes. Quickly, I learned law school was unlike my preconceived notions. The students at SIU School of Law are friendly and eager to help each other. Classmates shared notes and no one stole my books. In fact, upperclassmen gave me textbooks they no longer needed and study guides for my first year. Law school is a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. It’s like a full-time job. I had 17.5 credit hours this semester, which consisted of contracts, property, torts, criminal law, legal research and writing, and professionalism. During the typical week, I was in class by 9:00 a.m. I left the law building by 4:30 p.m., went to the gym or for a run around the neighborhood, ate dinner, and spent the rest of the evening preparing for classes. In law school, there aren’t many assignments, papers, or projects like there were in undergraduate classes. Instead, the professors assign pages from the textbook to read and students must do the assigned readings to be prepared for class the next day. In most classes, my grade was based on one four-hour essay exam at the end of the semester. The classroom experience is different from Bradley because the professors “cold-call” on students, which means the professor chooses a student at random to answer questions. During the very first class on the first day  – Contracts I at 9:00 a.m. – the professor asked, “Is Ms. Hoffman here today?” I answered, “Yes.” My professor proceeded to ask me a series of questions about the sources of contract law. I was nervous, but answered the questions correctly. Most of my time this semester was spent in class or studying, but I also made time for fun. I went to the tailgates held at the Saluki football games and joined the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund and the Women’s Law Forum. Throughout the semester, I volunteered in the school’s Self Help Legal Clinic. I have no doubt my experience at Bradley prepared me to be successful in law school. I received great grades in my classes. This summer, I will work as a judicial extern for a judge in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of Illinois. Looking back, I realize I didn’t need to feel sad on graduation day at Bradley because “once a Brave, always a Brave!” January 12th, 2011 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Getting down to the business of acting By Marlon Washington ’10 Before I start telling of my post-grad journeys, I want to say that college is a fantasy world, and I was fully caught up in the magic. The moment I walked across the stage at graduation, the real world took control and ate the magic for breakfast. I was fortunate to have landed an acting job in Pocatello, Idaho, before I graduated. On May 15, 2010, I left Bradley for the last time as a student. I had a month before leaving for Idaho, so I planned to just sit around the house for two weeks. Then I realized, as an actor, I started my job the second I walked across the stage at commencement. That’s when I got down to business. The next day, I used the information from my theatre seminar class at Bradley and started researching where I was going to find my next acting job.  After a few auditions, I landed my second acting job before I even started my first! I left the flatlands of the Midwest for the mountains of Idaho on June 21.  I moved into a six-bedroom apartment with five other guys and we started rehearsals for “Hairspray” the next morning. I was pumped to be doing one of my dream shows. The director also served as choreographer, and he wore us out.  I lost ten pounds during the run of the show as a result of the intense dancing.  I played the characters of Duane, camera man, and hooked. “Hairspray” was a blast, and the cast was awesome on and off-stage.  I was definitely not ready to “stop the beat.” After “Hairspray” closed, we sent a few cast members home and started work on “Peter Pan.” I took on the role of Smee. This meant a lot less dancing, less rehearsal, many more acting challenges, and much pain for me. Playing Captain Hook’s right-hand man meant I was pushed, pulled, and thrown all over the stage. It was so much fun! Smee was a great character to discover, and the run of the show went smoothly. Overall, journeying to Idaho was an awesome experience and I would go back in a heartbeat. I formed some really strong bonds and leaving was extremely difficult, but my life was about to take another turn. My next journey was doing a tour of “Robin Hood” for elementary schools in the Midwest and on the east coast. I took on the role of Robin Hood and Prince John. I was on the road for two and a half months with two other actors and we played eight different characters. Being on tour was quite an experience with tons of stress and tons of laughs that I will never forget. My favorite state was Pennsylvania. Now, I am doing live, in-store, infomercials all over the Chicago area, and acting in a play for my religious denomination that will be performed in Mississippi.  My life is constantly changing. January 5th, 2011 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Keeping students learning, alumni connected By Jordan Ticaric ’08, M.A. ’10 There comes a time in everyone’s life when one asks the question, “How did I get here?”  For me, the answer is simple…my education and my experiences at Bradley University. Throughout my undergraduate years at Bradley I served on committees, was student body president for two years and worked in the community. During my graduate program, I worked in the Student Activities Office at Bradley and did an internship at the Community Foundation of Central Illinois. Now, I am the assistant director of the Knox Fund at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois.  I work in an office with 19 colleagues, but I am on a team of three working to raise more than $3 million for student financial aid and merit scholarships.  It is my daily responsibility to figure out a way to keep students enrolled at Knox College and this is mainly done through our fundraising efforts. Twice a year, I am responsible for a month-long Phonathon program.  The Phonathon generates an enormous amount of revenue from Knox alumni and parents and has continued its growth under my watch. Along with our semi-annual fundraisers, I also work hands-on with the Knox faculty/staff campaigns, class agent letters/correspondence and am in the process of creating a parent association for Knox. The College is full of tradition and history, making venturing onto the quad, eating in the café with students, walking the halls of Old Main to the President’s Office, or posing in the library nothing short of extraordinary. The transition from being a student to becoming a responsible, contributing adult in today’s society was hard.  Heck, it’s still hard!  Each morning I wake up early, put on my game face and battle gear, and make the 45-minute commute from Peoria to Galesburg.  Sometimes it’s hard to remember that I’m Jordan the employee and professional, rather than Jordan the bouncing student leader. In today’s economy, I face a very real challenge every day.  So much of our future depends upon our students of today and yet these students need to rely on the generosity of others to fulfill their individual destiny.  Knox alumni have been an inspiration to me.  Each day I hear stories of involved alumni or actually interact with former Knox students who have made an impact on the world, but who still feel a commitment to their alma mater.   Each experience motivates and excites me to be that very special alumnus to Bradley, my alma mater. I was raised with the quote, “To whom much is given, much is expected.”  I’ve been blessed with a great job, a fantastic support system and the opportunity to be surrounded by fantastic mentors.  I want to give back. It’s the least I can do. I bought a house last year and am now a permanent resident of Peoria. When I left my family to attend Bradley, my famous last words were, “I go to school in Peoria, but Lombard is my home.”  Six years later, I have had to eat those words, as Peoria is now my home.  That’s okay, my experiences at Bradley University have all been great, so the words taste sweet. December 22nd, 2010 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Professional quest begins at new charter academy By Marcus Belin ’10 Seven months have passed since graduation and I am still  in Peoria. A week before graduation I was offered what a first-year teacher would call the opportunity of a lifetime when I was the first  teacher hired at Peoria’s first charter school. I am teaching 5th and 6th grade social studies at Quest Charter Academy, an opportunity to lay the foundation of my dreams of being an educator. I am shocked and amazed at what this opportunity has presented me. I teach 150 students a day from 7:30 a.m. until 4:10 p.m. I was super nervous at having my own classroom, setting it up, and preparing for the upcoming school year. This was not an ordinary first year of teaching; it was the school’s first year, too, so there was much to do. Starting from scratch was hard but it was very rewarding. On August 24th, everything we had been planning  all summer came to life when 225 students filled the building on their first day of school. That day I greeted every student who got off the bus. In those first few seconds I realized I was doing exactly what I had always wanted to do. Just as I was at Bradley, I am involved in everything the school offers. I coach girls and boys basketball, the Quest step team, and the track team. I’m busy, but enhancing the student experience is not only my job, it’s personally rewarding. Many of our students come from poverty stricken neighborhoods and low-income families, but these are very talented individuals that challenge me every day, just as I challenge them. If you ask these students, “Where do you plan to be in ten years?” every one of them will tell you “That’s simple… college!” I instill in them the importance of education and the expectation that they’ll go to college. I present it as a reality, not a dream. I have grown to love my profession. My overall goal is to become the U.S. Secretary of Education. My plan is to return to Bradley to earn a master’s in education administration degree and then a Ph.D. in educational leadership. I  want to become a principal and a superintendent before reaching my ultimate goal. This job is my first stepping stone to fulfilling my goals. My students are my motivation and being part of their success propels me forward.  My job is a calling to educate young people and prepare them to be successful. I tell my students that I came from the same type of neighborhoods that they live in, I am 23 years old and I am fulfilling my dreams. Anything is possible. Dream big! Bradley is due much credit. It opened many doors for me and connected me to valuable resources.  The classes, professors, and field experiences helped me understand what to prepare for and expect from the real world. Thank you, BU. My college experience from the classroom to graduation was a true stepping stone for success in my career, and there’s much more to come. Special thanks to my family, professors, and friends who have believed in me. Onward, I go! December 16th, 2010 in Onward (2010-2011) | No Comments Making a smooth transition into medical school By Jenny Van Kirk ’10 For some people, six months can pass by with little change in lifestyle or daily routine.  For me, the last six months have been filled with changes in every aspect of my life.  Since I graduated from Bradley last May, I have moved to Washington, D.C., have met an entirely new circle of classmates and friends, and have embarked upon the career I will pursue for the rest of my professional life. I began classes as a first-year medical student at Georgetown University School of Medicine on August 9.  While I was nervous about what classes would bring, I could not have been better prepared to enter medical school.  The transition was surprisingly smooth and easy for me, and I attribute that to the excellent preparation I received at Bradley, through classes, interactions with professors, and extracurricular activities.  Managing my time is essential, as there is an incredible amount of information to be learned, and not enough time in which to do so.  As a student-athlete at Bradley, time management is one area in which I received plenty of practice! There is no typical day in the life of a medical student.  In general, a day will include at least three hours of lecture and some sort of anatomy lab (four hours) or small group session (two hours).  After classes are over for the day, I head to the gym for a quick workout, and then back to the library to review the information we learned that day.  I love what I am learning so far and we haven’t even scratched the surface of the vast amount of information yet to be presented.  We are currently in our cardio-pulmonary module, and it is fascinating.  The human body is amazing and I am anxious to learn more about it. Despite my love of the science part of becoming a physician, my favorite part of medical school thus far is seeing patients.  Although we cannot treat them or offer any medical advice, we have opportunities to go into the hospital and interview patients to practice our communications skills and gain experience in physician-patient interactions.  For me, conversing with patients is a very humbling experience, and an excellent reminder of why I am in medical school.  Patients have such incredible and inspiring stories, and if I am able to make a small difference in their lives, then all the hard work over the next few years will be totally worthwhile.  There were countless individuals at Bradley who had a positive influence on my life over my four-year career. I can only hope to “pay it forward” and spread that passion for people wherever life’s journey takes me.
