The most common reaction we get from visitors is, “Your publications don’t do the campus justice.” As hard as we try, our admission publications cannot convey the beauty of our campus or the friendliness of our people. Photographs alone just won’t allow you to witness the energy of a university dedicated to the craft of teaching and a student body committed to collaborative learning. For these reasons and others, we suggest you visit Redlands and see for yourself. You will find a thriving community rich in opportunities for meaningful interaction, stimulating involvement and lasting friendships. There are several opportunities to experience Redlands. Our staff will be happy to assist you in choosing the type of visit right for you.
