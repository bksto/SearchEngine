Courses, degree programs, and policies that govern progress towards completion of a degree are described in the Catalog. Students are responsible for knowing and understanding the contents of the catalog they are following and are strongly encouraged to read the UA's student responsibility policy. For non-academic information that used to be included in the Catalog (before the Catalog became online only), see the Related Topics on the policies page or go to the UA Homepage. On many subjects, more detailed information is available from departments, colleges or administrative units responsible for various programs and services.  Students should seek information from these sources as needed.
