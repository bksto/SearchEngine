Tour groups are met at the Gardens entrance at the scheduled time. If you arrive early, use the opportunity to peruse pamphlets, get a drink of water and use the restrooms (the next restrooms are 20 to 30 minutes along the tour). Docents are available 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Tours last about an hour, depending on interest and questions. Most buses can turn around and drop off students near the entrance and park in the Gardens' free lot where they don't block traffic. Buses may also leave campus and return to pick up the students at an appointed time. There is a 15-minute leeway for arrival. If your group is 15 minutes late, the guided tour is cancelled. Allow plenty of time for loading and traffic. Some classes like to bring a sack lunch to eat on the lawn area after the tour. Tours are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.
