Financial aid can be a combination of scholarships, grants, loans, waivers, and student employment. Scholarships and grants are considered “free money” and the student is not required to repay; however, loans and student employment are considered self-help aid and most loans require repayment when a student becomes enrolled less than half time or graduates. Student employment includes both work-study positions and part-time employment positions, either on- or off- campus. © Copyright 2012 California State University San Marcos. All rights reserved.
