Curtis This exhibit features the voices of contemporary Native American artists, working in a variety of media, who in their work treat issues of identity and perception specifically in response to the work of Edward S. Curtis. Many explore ways to reclaim ownership of native identity from the enduring perceptions created and imposed upon them by non-native explorers, colonizers, missionaries, historians, and artists. The artists’ pieces and personal statements lend depth and add complexity to the Curtis photogravures currently on exhibit. The artists featured in the exhibit include: Marla Allison, Hopi Bert Benally, Navajo Susan Folwell, Santa Clara Pueblo Jason Garcia, Santa Clara Pueblo Douglas Miles, San Carlos Apache/Akimel O'odham Virgil Ortiz, Cochiti Pueblo Cara Romero, Chemehuevi Diego Romero, Cochiti Pueblo Mateo Romero, Cochiti Pueblo Joseph M.

Simpson, Santa Clara Pueblo Will Wilson, Navajo Annabel Wong, Akimel O’odham/Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community This exhibit is brought to you in part through the generosity of Jody Folwell.

Twenty images will be exhibited at one time, then rotated after six months, for a total of sixty over the life of the exhibit.

More About Paths of Life (including an online panoramic tour) Top Photo by ASM Staff Waiting for Grandfather, a 168 cm. tall limestone sculpture by Taos Pueblo artist John Suazo, graces the entrance to ASM's south building. A gift from the family of Burt and Brenda Lazar, “Waiting for Grandfather” was installed by Arizona State Museum January 2013 and is among more than 40 outdoor public art installations that enhance the University of Arizona campus. “Every detail has meaning to me because every piece begins deep inside me,” the artist says. “The young woman is waiting anxiously to see Grandfather, to show her baby to him because he has not yet seen the child. The belt around her skirt is like the one my grandmother used to wear. The stairstep design at the bottom of the woman’s skirt represents the steps we take in life. I hope that by looking at my work, one can find a missing piece of knowledge in themselves.” Installation of Waiting for Grandfather was generously underwritten by the Friends of the ASM Collections. More about John Suazo from Turquoise Magazine and American Indian Computer Art Project. (PDF*) Top Photo by Jannelle Weakly Watercarrier, a bronze sculpture by Apache artist Craig Dan Goseyun, adorns the front entrance of ASM's north building. Purchased by Arnold and Doris Roland as a generous gift to the museum, "Watercarrier" represents one of the most vital elements to a desert community—water. "Water is one of the most important resources. Practically all cultures throughout the world at one time or another transported their goods balanced on top of their head on the center of gravity. The woman is wearing a garment that covers her full body. The swirl represents the connection between the earth and sky." —Craig Dan Goseyun More About Watercarrier and Craig Goseyun from Indian Country Today Top Docent-led Orientation Tours Get a taste and see the highlights of the current exhibits at Arizona State Museum!
