Gould that marine creatures underwent an “early burst” of functional diversity during the dawn of animal life.

Over the past 542 million years, the mean size of marine animals has increased 150-fold. Ancient 'topsy-turvy' climate in western U.S. informs current climate models Vanderbilt University Kate Maher and a team of scientists at Stanford and Vanderbilt Universities have created the first comprehensive map of the topsy-turvy climate of the western U.S. and are using it to test and improve the ability of global climate models to predict future precipitation patterns. European grain yield stagnation related to climate change Stanford School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences After changes in government policy and farm practices, European grain yields leveled off. Stanford's Frances C. Moore says climate trends account for 10 percent of that stagnation.
