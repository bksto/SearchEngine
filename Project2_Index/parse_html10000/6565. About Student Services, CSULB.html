As “partners in learning,” the division strives to enhance and support the academic mission of the university, to assure the rights of the individual, to seek solutions to persistent issues and problems and to encourage independent thought and action. The division works to contribute to the development and maintenance of a healthy, safe and orderly campus environment that is responsive to the needs of a diverse student body and conducive to the development of leadership, citizenship and collegiality of students. “We're making a DIFFERENCE in the lives of our students” The division also seeks to prepare its diverse constituencies - men and women of varied ages, cultures and ethnic backgrounds - for their role as creative and productive citizens in the international community. Finally, through regular self-review processes, the division endeavors to respond to the needs of a changing student population. The major responsibility of the Division of Student Services is to maintain a comprehensive education and student support service program to meet the needs of students. Toward these ends, the division provides oversight and direction for more than 35 university programs and service areas that support CSULB students outside the classroom.
