Each year the campus must complete ATI annual reports and update the campus implementation plans pursuant to Coded Memo AA-2013-03. The California State University (CSU) system launched a system-wide Accessible Technology Initiative (ATI) in order to develop the work plan, guidance, and resources to assist campuses in carrying out the accessible technology provisions of CSU Executive Order 926 (EO): "It is the policy of the CSU to make information technology resources and services accessible to all CSU students, faculty, staff, and the general public regardless of disability." The Accessible Technology Initiative (ATI) at Sacramento State is a reflection of the University’s ongoing campus-wide commitment to accessible technology. As part of the ATI, this web page has been developed to provide you with accessibility resources and information. Check it out and let us know what you think or send questions to: ATI Feedback.

Quote from the President on the Accessible Technology Initiative "At its heart, this initiative is about fairness and about doing what the CSU does best – offering the greatest possible access to higher education. Under this initiative, the CSU is committed to making information technology and resources available to everyone, regardless of ability or challenge. It is a large effort, and many of you will be involved. I would ask that we all work to live up to the spirit of this work – to do all we can in our individual work to make the campus more accessible." (President's Fall Address, August 30, 2007, President Alexander Gonzalez, Sacramento State) Please contact ati@csus.edu if you encounter any problems accessing the Accessible Technology Initiative web site or need to request this information in alternate formats.
