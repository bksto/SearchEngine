Robert S. Feldman Deputy Chancellor and Donor "I came to UMass because it was a school with so many amazing opportunities. Throughout my four years I learned that many of these opportunities would not have been possible without alumni support. I give back to UMass so I can provide future students with the same unforgettable experience I had. " Lauren Byrne '13, SPHHS "As we were able to give more, we have." Pam and Bob Jacobs have always given back to UMass Amherst--from engaging with alumni at events to serving on the UMass Amherst Foundation Board to helping to endow a Center for Jewish Studies, a passion of theirs.  Robert D. Jacobs and Pamela M. Jacobs '68 and '69 "We both got a great education at UMass, and we’ve done well because of it, so we wanted to give back. We always give an annual gift but we wanted to do more. We figured, rather than waiting for maybe 30 years or more, we’d do something now…and provide a little interest income in our later years too." Kelvin Cross and Caren Arnstein '75, '77MS and '77 Chairman, President and CEO of Waters Corp. and UMass Rising Campaign Co-Chair "Over the past 20 years I have become intimately involved with a number of aspects of the university, including the school of management and the environmental sciences. I have seen firsthand how great research, a committed faculty and private partnerships give students a richer learning environment. Diana and I look forward to seeing the impact this new center will have across the university."
