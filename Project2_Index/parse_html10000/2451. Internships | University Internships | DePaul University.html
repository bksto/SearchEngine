The benefits of having an internship are many, from gaining career experience and earning academic credit, to fulfilling a work-study requirement, building a professional network, and earning money. About 2,000 DePaul undergraduates complete internships for academic credit every year. The University Internship Program, operated by the Career Center​, helps match students with internships in their field of interest. There are also internships available through every undergraduate college and school at DePaul. All of these internships not only qualify for academic credit, they also fulfill students' experiential learning requirement. In some cases you can even convert an existing job into an internship to receive academic credit if it meets the internship programs's standards and guidelines. Not surprisingly, in a city the size of Chicago, there are thousands of internships and part-time jobs. They don’t all qualify for academic credit, but they do provide work experience and often pay. The Career Center and your department office can give you leads and help you make connections.  Here are some of the corporations and organizations that host DePaul interns: A​bbott Laboratories Aetna, Inc.
