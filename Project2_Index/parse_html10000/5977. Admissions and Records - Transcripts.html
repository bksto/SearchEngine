During busy request times (e.g. end of term), the processing time may take as long as 5-7 working days. Remember that the 3-5 days processing time means the time it takes to process the request in our office. This processing time does not include allotting the time required for mailing the request to us or us mailing the transcript to your recipient(s). When making your request, you should plan sufficient lead time to allow for possible delays. Requests for electronic PDF transcripts are processed the same work day if received by 3pm PST. Orders received after 3pm will be processed the next work day. There are no "RUSH" transcript services. If you attended spring 1990 or after, it is suggested you request an electronic transcript in PDF format for the most expedient processing option. No "same day" service is available.
