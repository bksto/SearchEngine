At Cal State L.A. we believe that compassion and caring for one another are at the heart of what an education means. Founded in 1947, our University is committed to the well-being of our city and our region and focused on becoming a powerful engine of social mobility. We are dedicated to providing an affordable, outstanding education to our students and ensuring that they leave Cal State L.A. with the expertise and accomplishments that will lead to further success. Cal State L.A.’s eight colleges are recognized for outstanding academic programs and professors who are renowned mentors and researchers. We’ve been named by Washington Monthly as one of the top ten master’s universities in the nation for our contribution to the public good. This exceptional honor is based on our graduation rates, public service by our students, and research funding that supports transformative faculty scholarship. In addition, The Princeton Review has recognized Cal State L.A. for having one of the finest MBA programs in the country. The National Science Foundation has ranked our University as the top supplier of Latino science and engineering Ph.D. recipients among all undergraduate and master’s degree universities in the continental United States. It’s an exciting time to be at Cal State L.A. We have reinvented thousands of courses and programs as we move forward with an ambitious conversion from a quarter to semester calendar that will take effect in fall 2016. As part of this change, we have implemented a general education requirement that all students complete two courses that feature engagement with the surrounding multicultural neighborhoods and the greater Los Angeles area. Civic learning and community service will be closely connected to their coursework. As the first in my family to graduate with a college degree, I am deeply committed to providing opportunities for our students to achieve academic, personal, and professional success. I also want to help our students develop a high regard for the intellectual and cultural diversity that distinguishes Cal State L.A. I invite you all to explore our university website, visit our vibrant campus community, and consider enrolling at Cal State L.A. William A.
