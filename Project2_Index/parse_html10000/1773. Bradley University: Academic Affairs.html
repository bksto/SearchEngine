Each of the offices below plays a special role in maintaining the programs and curricula that have made Bradley a nationally-renowned university. Provost's Office The Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs is the administrative center for the University’s academic operations. It is responsible for providing administrative oversight and academic leadership. The primary focus of the office is to collaborate with academic and administrative areas to fulfill the mission and vision of Bradley University. Continuing Education and Professional Development Continuing Education connects the University with the community through educational programs and services for youth, professionals, and lifelong learners. The Division also provides conference planning services for those wishing to host a conference, symposium, or meeting. Library Featuring a full collection of books, magazines, news articles and laptops available for checkout and a computer lab with both Mac and PC machines, the Cullom-Davis Library is a central location for students to conduct research, organize meetings or simply study quietly. The library is continually working to enhance its holdings, but any book that is not readily available on campus can be brought in from one of the 71 libraries in Illinois that have partnered with Bradley’s consortial agreements. The library’s Web site, library.bradley.edu, also features access to its online database of professional journals and publications. Registrar's Office The Office of the Registrar is dedicated to the service of faculty and students through scheduling, registration, record keeping, and reporting as well as assisting the academic and administrative offices in support of the dynamic community while maintaining the academic integrity of Bradley University. Office of Sponsored Programs Sponsored programs are an important part of the university's academic mission. By securing outside grants for their creative production and research, faculty are able to make their teaching more valuable to students, and more rewarding for themselves. Center for Teaching Excellence and Learning Teaching Excellence Programs offer faculty workshops on teaching, provide materials on how to improve one's teaching, and offer internal grants to faculty for the development of innovative teaching and the creation of new courses.  Research Development focuses on helping faculty develop professionally by providing internal funding for research and creative production. © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
