One was to pump up his career-low 16 stolen bases; the other was to decrease his American League-lea...

He swings leisurely, adjusts his batting gloves, then his helmet. He saunters back across the chalk, then digs his feet into the dirt for the next pitch.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity Wednesday because the Angels have not announced the move. The deal was the midpoint between the salary figures exchanged by the sides. Freese batted .260 in his first season with the Angels, getting off to a weak... By GREG BEACHAM The Associated Press |on 01/28/2015 Columnists Voters reject PED users for Baseball Hall of Fame, yet Adderall is part of the game The doors have been slammed, the spines have been stiffened, the high horse rides toward Cooperstown. Barry Bonds is still not a Hall of Famer. The baseball writers anointed Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz and Craig Biggio on Tuesday, as they should have. Next year, Ken Griffey Jr. and Trevor Hoffman will most likely be first-ballot picks. Bonds got 36.8 percent of the vote and needed 75. He got 36.2 and 34.7 percent in his first two eligible... Mark Whicker |on 01/06/2015 Dodgers Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, Craig Biggio, John Smoltz elected to Baseball Hall of Fame Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and John Smoltz, a trio of star pitchers who dominated in an era of offense, were elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame on Tuesday along with Craig Biggio, the first time since 1955 writers selected four players in one year. The Big Unit, Martinez and Smoltz easily earned induction on their first tries, and Biggio made it on the third attempt after falling two votes shy last year. Steroids-tainted stars Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire and... By Ronald Blum The Associated Press |on 01/06/2015 Angels Angels get Matt Joyce from Rays for Kevin Jepsen ANAHEIM >> The Angels acquired outfielder Matt Joyce from the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday in exchange for right-handed reliever Kevin Jepsen. The Angels have big plans for Joyce, envisioning him as their primary designated hitter and possible No. 2 hitter, which would allow AL MVP Mike Trout to hit third in front of Albert Pujols and Josh Hamilton. Joyce’s left-handed bat and playing experience at both corner outfield spots also should allow Hamilton to spend more games as a...

Bryant caught a career-best three touchdown catches from Tony Romo and the Dallas Cowboys rallied to beat the Philadelphia Eagles 38-27 on Sunday night after wasting a 21-0 lead. DeMarco Murray had a pair of TD runs to help the Cowboys (10-4) move ahead of the Eagles (9-5) into first place in the NFC East. The Eagles dominated the Cowboys in... By Rob Maaddi The Associated Press |on 12/14/2014 Angels It’s up to Andrew Heaney to make sure Angels don’t miss Howie Kendrick We have an early candidate for American League Most Valuable Player, 2015. On Wednesday, Andrew Heaney was traded twice. He was first dealt for Dee Gordon, who led the National League in triples and steals last season. Next, he was dealt for Howie Kendrick, a career .292 hitter in 1,081 major league at-bats, who tied his career high with 75 RBIs. Basically the Dodgers traded Gordon for Kendrick and laundered it through Miami, with Heaney as the... Mark Whicker |on 12/14/2014 Dodgers Dodgers and Angels trades upon further review Your first reaction is that Yasmani Grandal had better be good. He did hit 15 home runs last year, fourth in the N.L. for catchers, and hit eight of them in the Big Valley also known as Petco Park. And, in 67 starts for the Padres, Grandal threw out seven basestealers and failed to throw out 49. It’s extremely doubtful Clayton Kershaw or Zack Greinke would rather throw to Grandal than to A.J. Ellis, the control panel for the Dodgers’ pitching staff. But... Mark Whicker |on 12/11/2014 Dodgers GM: Dodgers aren’t close to trading Matt Kemp to the Padres SAN DIEGO >> It was no secret among baseball insiders camped at the Manchester Grand Hyatt that the Padres were looking to make a splash at the Winter Meetings. They have a new general manager and a somewhat new ownership group. The event was in their backyard and the timing would never be better for a headline-grabbing deal. The Dodgers are not in a hurry to make a splash. They made a trade Tuesday, but it involved a player (Drew Butera) who had already been removed from their... JP Hoornstra |on 12/10/2014 MLB baseball Dodgers trade catcher Drew Butera to Angels SAN DIEGO — In lieu of any blockbuster trades, the Winter Meetings at least got interesting for the Dodgers and Angels. The teams finalized a trade Tuesday that sendt catcher Drew Butera from the Dodgers to the Angels for a player to be named or cash. It is the first trade between the teams since 1993, when the Angels shipped outfielder Reggie Williams to Chavez Ravine for pitcher Mike James. The Angels entered the Winter Meetings with few needs. One was a backup catcher,...
