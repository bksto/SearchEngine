But it is also a statement that donors trust the University to treat their contributions with care. Looking after that investment is the role of The University Foundation at Sacramento State. History and vision For more than 20 years, The University Foundation at Sacramento State has served as the University's primary philanthropic auxiliary, actively supporting the University's mission of teaching, learning and service by acquiring and managing financial and other resources for the University. As of July 1, 2006, the California State University, Sacramento Trust Foundation has been renamed The University Foundation at Sacramento State.Â The University Foundation at Sacramento State has served as the University's primary philanthropic foundation, and the new name better reflects this important role. The University Foundation was established in 1986 as the CSUS Trust Foundation to acquire and manage financial and other resources for the University. Its founding was a key step toward strengthening the fund-raising program at Sacramento State. It oversees gift funds to Sacramento State, which are held in non-state accounts, audited annually and invested prudently. It is a tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) organization and a recognized auxiliary of Sacramento State. The University has raised millions of dollars in private support, funds that are vital to enhancing the quality of education for current and future Sacramento State students. The Foundation provides a unique and invaluable service to the campus by prudently investing endowment funds with the goal of generating a reliable income stream while assuring long-term growth. As a 501(c)(3) organization, The University Foundation has greater flexibility in investments than the University, which as a political subdivision of the State of California may not invest in securities. Donors may give gifts to The University Foundation at Sacramento State for specific campus purposes and obtain tax benefits in accordance with State of California and United States federal laws. All funds managed by the University Foundation at Sacramento State are used for the benefit of the University, honoring any restrictions placed on them by the donor. Gift funds are held in non-state accounts, audited annually and invested prudently.
