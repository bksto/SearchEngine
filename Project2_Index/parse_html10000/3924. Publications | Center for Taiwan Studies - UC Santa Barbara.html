Skip to main content Center for Taiwan Studies - UC Santa Barbara Main menu Home About Goals Publications News & Events Resources People Publications The CTS has launched four series of publications in promoting English translation of Taiwan literature and Taiwan-related studies in English. Through these series CTS seeks to demonstrate the validity of Taiwan literature as a world literature, by making representative works accessible in English translation and thereby promoting the appreciation and study of Taiwan literature from international perspectives. These series will provide a growing resource of materials for teaching and research beyond the borders of Taiwan, not only in Taiwan literature itself, but in the fields of Chinese literature, comparative literature, and world literatures in Chinese.   Taiwan Literature: English Translation Series To promote a better understanding and effective knowledge among scholars abroad of the current state and tendencies of literature as it has developed in Taiwan, this journal introduces the voices of Taiwan literature as expressed in recent publications by Taiwanese writers and scholars. Two issues are published each year, each with its own focus, comprised by critiques, fiction, essays, poems, and studies. Starting in 1996, thirty-one issues have been published to date.   Taiwan Studies Series CTS has inaugurated the Taiwan Studies Series, with the proceedings of the 2004 international conference, Taiwan Imagined and Its Reality: An Exploration of Literature, History, and Culture as Volume 1.
