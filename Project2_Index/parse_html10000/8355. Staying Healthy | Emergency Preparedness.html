Staying Current on UC Merced's Situation The CDC recommends that colleges should consider all possible channels to inform students, faculty and staff of preventative information. The campus will employ the use of this site, campuswide e-mails and social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter to provide timely information and updates. Therefore, you can keep up to date on the pandemic situation at UC Merced by: Visiting this site regularly Following UC Merced on Twitter Becoming a fan of UC Merced on Facebook Vaccinations at UC Merced Registered students are offered seasonal flu vaccinations each year by Student Health Services. Employees will be offered the same vaccination this year for $12. Campus flu clinic dates and times will be posted when available. What to Do When You are Sick If you have mild symptoms: Stay home or in your dorm room to avoid making others sick. Remain at home or in your dorm room, except to get medical care or other necessities, until your fever has been gone for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medicine. Students should call their personal health care provider or Student Health Services (209-228-2273). Please call for a consultation rather than dropping by the Center. Faculty and staff are urged to contact their primary care provider by phone rather than dropping by their physician’s office. If you have severe symptoms or are at high risk for complications from the flu (e.g.— you have a condition such as as diabetes, asthma and obesity), contact your health care provider. Your health care provider will decide whether flu treatment is needed. The CDC is no longer recommending testing/swabbing individuals with flu-like symptoms and, therefore, the university may not know for certain whether any individual on campus is infected with the H1N1 flu. Additional advice about how to avoid spreading the flu is available on the CDC website. Can the University Require You to Stay Home? Employees should not come to work sick, and students should not come to class sick. Supervisors should consult Human Resources if they have concerns about an employee's health. Guidelines Regarding Cancellation of Classes In a public health emergency, it is the responsibility of the public health departments at the county and state levels to issue quarantine orders, direct closures of facilities, designate key healthcare facilities, and distribute anti-viral medications. The UC Merced campus is located in Merced County and has facilities in other counties in California as well. All segments of UC Merced work closely with the appropriate county and state public health offices to comply with all guidance and recommendations. Driving Safety Buckling Up Isn't Enough: Your Role in Avoiding Accidents The Police Department Reminds Campus Community to Drive Safely   With increased traffic on Bellevue and Lake roads, we remind drivers, cyclists and pedestrians to be careful while traveling to and from campus. Your safety is our top concern. A number of things can contribute to driver distraction including eating, adjusting the music, taking in the scenery or using a cell phone. We urge you to avoid such distracting activities and keep these important guidelines in mind: Always wear your seat belt Deal with phone conversations, text messages, e-mails and other alerts after you have reached your destination Slow down Allow plenty of time to get to your destination Above all, stay focused on the road If you are involved in an accident or witness an accident, please notify campus police immediately at 209-228-2677 (CAT-COPS) or 911.
