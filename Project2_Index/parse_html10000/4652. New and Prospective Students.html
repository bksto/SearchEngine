Applying for Financial Aid  FAFSA Eligible Students Financing your CSULB education is an important process for many CSULB students. College is possible for everyone, and a variety of financial aid options are available to help with the costs. As you consider the value of a CSULB education, the U.S. Department of Education has developed a very useful and informative Web site, College.gov, to help you plot your road to college. In order to be considered for need-based financial aid---including loans, grants, scholarships and Federal Work-Study ---you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). To be considered for priority financial aid please make sure you file the FAFSA by (i.e., for the 2015 – 2016 year, the priority deadline is March 2, 2015). The FAFSA is available and completed online. When completing the FAFSA please make sure that you indicate you will be attending CSU Long Beach when listing your schools of attendance; our federal school code is 001139. The FAFSA requests data from income information from the prior year. If you (or your parents) have not yet completed your taxes, you should report estimated figures. After your FAFSA has been processed you will have the opportunity to correct your estimates once tax returns have been filed. Be sure to review the How to Apply page of our website for helpful information on completing the FAFSA.
