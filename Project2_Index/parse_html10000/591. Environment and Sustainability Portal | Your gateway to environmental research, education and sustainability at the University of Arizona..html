In his latest project, he has co-founded a non-profit that uses fieldwork and education to save the endangered fishing cats of southeast India and their wetland habitat.

It’s not always easy to know the relative impacts—financial or environmental—of the many electronics used daily in apartment life, which is what makes the Eco Power “virtual apartment” interactive software expansion so very handy.

"Climate changes are happening and they have very long, lasting impacts," says Owen, who works for the Climate Assessment of the Southwest housed at the UA and funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She and her fellow scientists hope to inform local and state government on climate-change decisions. (This is the latest installment in a KGUN-TV series on UA researchers.)
