All Stanford graduate students with a full fellowship, are subject to the University rule in GAP 7.2 1.1 (paragraph below the bullets) that limits additional employment to 8 hours a week if paid hourly or up to a 10 hour TA or RA appointment. If some combination of both the limit is 8 hours a week. VPGE Fellowships such as the SGF, SIGF, DARE or ARCS that have no work obligation are equivalent to 0 hours of work per week. Schools or departments may establish more restrictive rules!

Fellows who enroll in Cardinal Care (Stanford’s health insurance plan) and have a full VPGE fellowship, are eligible to receive the university subsidy of $716 (or half of the insurance premium) during the quarters that they are using their fellowship. Fellows are responsible for paying the second half of the insurance premium unless their department has specifically offered to cover it. In some cases, the health insurance can be paid directly out of a student’s stipend. SGF SIGF DARE Lieberman ARCS FAQs CCSRE Aug 29th, 2014 Open in app Facebook Tweet Mail Permalink Next
