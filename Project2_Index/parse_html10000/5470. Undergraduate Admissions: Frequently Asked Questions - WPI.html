Can more than one counselor per school attend the BEANS Tour? A. Only one counselor per school may attend the BEANS Tour each year.  Q. What do you consider when selecting the final BEANS Tour participants? A. The host institutions determine the final participants based upon a numbers of factors. Among them are geographic diversity and recent BEANS Tour participation from other colleagues at your school.   Q. What costs is the college counselor responsible for? A. The following expenses are the responsibility of the college counselors: Travel to and from home to the train/bus station or airport you are using Travel from airport to  Boston Hotel Parking at the train/bus station or airport Dry-cleaning, movies, and room service in the hotel room Dinner in Boston on Monday evening. Meals and accommodations in Boston should you choose to arrive pre-tour or remain post-tour to visit other colleges, or family and friends in the area. Q. Is there time to check email and voicemail while on the tour? A. The schedule for the tour is comprehensive. Typically, participants board the bus between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. and are busy with the tour for the entirety of the day, including dinner on two of the evenings. This leaves very limited time to access email and handle business details while on the tour. Each hotel has a business center which will provide services; please do not plan to check email during your visits to the five colleges. Q. Once I fill out the pre-registration online, when will I find out if I have been selected to participate in an upcoming BEANS tour?   A: You will be notified in writing by January 19, 2015. Q. Is it possible for me to leave early or arrive late to the tour? A: Unfortunately, no. Each of the five institutions has planned exciting programs for your stay and we expect all participants to be present for all college visits. Q. Can I reserve a single room? A: Absolutely! The cost per night is $130 for the two nights you are in Boston (Sunday and Monday). The third night in Worcester every participant will enjoy single room accommodations. Q. Will I be able to meet with former students from my high school? A: Each college or university will make every effort to contact former students from your high school to allow you to meet with them during your campus visit. If there is a specific student you hope to reach, please feel free to contact the tour planning committee member from that institution to work out the details. Q. What if I have a dietary restriction or physical limitation? A: No problem!
