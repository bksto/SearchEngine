From 85 charter members in 1964, this group now numbers 10,500 dedicated supporters. Members include those who have made outright gifts of $25,000 or more in their lifetimes, as well as those who have made deferred gifts of $50,000 or more. This program alone has recorded more than $500 million in private gifts to support the University. More than a society of generous contributors, Presidents Council members actively support our mission by lending their professional experience and input to University officials. All prior gifts to the University of Illinois Foundation and the University count toward Council membership and recognition levels*, regardless of previously designated campus beneficiaries. Corporate matching gifts qualify as well. *New pledges are not accepted for Council membership. Joint membership is extended to couples at all recognition levels.
