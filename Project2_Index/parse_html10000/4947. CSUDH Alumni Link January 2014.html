Alumna Eileen Yoshimura: History Repeats Itself Alumna Eileen Yoshimura (Class of ’80), director of financial management at Port of Los Angeles. It is often said that history repeats itself. This is true for alumna Eileen Yoshimura. At least in one context. Full article. Calling All Toro Alumnus Over "50" It's time to reconnect with your alma mater California State University, Dominguez Hills, by joining OLLI (Osher Lifelong Learning Institute). OLLI is a remarkable learning-in-retirement organization designed to offer individuals 50+ years of age an opportunity to renew their interests, meet like-minded adults, and benefit from social and cultural activities. OLLI offers unique learning experiences—computers courses such as iPad, tennis, genealogy, a book club, and movies to name but a few. I was familiar with computers before OLLI, but I swore that Facebook was a path I would never go down—until I joined OLLI. I took an OLLI Facebook class and now I’m able to see what my kids are saying about me! Included in the annual membership fee are many presentations by CSUDH faculty members who volunteer their time to teach the Osher Lecture Series. Additional classes are available for a modest fee. And no grades or tests are required—just loads of interaction and fun! One of the highlights of OLLI is the summer movie series. We watch older movies and it takes me back—“Murder on the Orient Express” for example. And the discussion with others after the movie is both rewarding and exhilarating. I encourage you to contact the OLLI office at (310) 243-3208, or by email at olli@csudh.edu  to get all the necessary information. We even have a website— www.csudh.edu/olli. Looking forward to seeing you back on campus and in the classroom!
