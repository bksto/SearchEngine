Hines College of Architecture is committed to preparing its students to take leadership roles in the architectural profession as it enters an unprecedented era of rapidly evolving social and environmental imperatives and emerging technological potentials. The Graduate Program promotes creative critical inquiry into the material and cultural contexts where architecture is practiced today. It provides a comprehensive foundation for practice at all scales and for a future of lifelong learning. Our design-centered program contains studios, seminars and lectures consistently focused on the process of creating where ideas find form in the field of architecture. Our Graduate Program is small in size and personal in its approach to architectural education with an average enrollment of 60 to 70 students. Studio sections typically have eight to ten students per faculty member. Lecture discussion groups and seminars classes have similar student-to-instructor ratios. The College offers a range of facilities, including an array of advanced and traditional fabrication equipment in the award-winning Burdette Keeland Jr. Design Center. A comprehensive in-house Architecture and Art Library, computing resources, along with diverse courses and faculty are all available to graduate students. Students have access to faculty members committed to all areas of practice — from industrial design to urban design — and a city with one of the largest concentrations of cultural, educational, professional, and industrial resources. Prospective students are encouraged to visit the College during the Fall or Spring term — when studios and classes are in session — to experience creative engagement the program fosters and the level of commitment our students maintain while pursuing design projects and course work.
