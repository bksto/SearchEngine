For a university employee to be paid, a payroll and personnel record must be entered into PPS. Only authorized PPS users can access PPS. The department head or delegate certifies that PPS access is required for the employee's necessary and proper performance of assigned job duties. UCPath is UC’s new PeopleSoft payroll and human resources information system, replacing the 11 versions of PPS and several other stand-alone human resource information systems with a single payroll and human resource information system for all UC employees. “Path” is an acronym for “Payroll, Academic Personnel, Timekeeping and Human Resources.” UCPath implementation will take place with a staged rollout to campuses and medical centers.
