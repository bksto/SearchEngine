In a complex world, we enable an engaged enterprise to stay connected, make smart decisions, and be productive. Improve Employee Productivity Browsing through different systems or using different mobile apps to find relevant information and approve tasks wastes precious time. Sitrion boosts your employee's productivity with smart solutions like finding internal expertise faster, making internal communication & collaboration more efficient and aggregating approvals from cumbersome systems like SAP, SharePoint or Salesforce into one mobile productivity stream.  Universal Approvals Daily routines like approvals take too much time. In fact you can improve manager productivity by 16%, just by optimizing approvals. Sitrion's solutions place all of your approvals into one aggregated stream either on your mobile device or within your (social) intranet. Workflow tasks like quotes, purchase requests, invoices, timesheets, and time off requests can be managed in one place rather than multiple separate applications. Actionable Insights Sitrion ONE, our enterprise mobility solution, enables smarter and faster decision-making based on actionable insights. Sitrion ONE collects and distributes relevant information from multiple backend systems in one app, reducing time spent accessing multiple apps for pertinent information. Productivity Stream Get all relevant information in one place on your mobile device and take immediate action on important information like sales forecast changes, inventory level alerts, corporate news, or notifications on new job applicants. Whatever your role requires, you define the triggers for items that get pushed into your productivity stream. Engaged Employees Using Sitrion solutions you can increase employee engagement levels by up to 74%. And research shows that engaged employees are more productive, more innovative, and take less sick days. In addition, 4 out of 10 social business leaders leverage Sitrion to collaborate more efficiently and significantly improve employee productivity (Source: InformationWeek). Mobilize Your Enterprise Efficiently Security, development costs, and skills shortage are the main concerns associated with enterprise mobility. Our smart enterprise mobility product solves these with a compelling end-to-end solution that includes enterprise application integration, cloud-based management, and simplified native app delivery. 100% Native Sitrion ONE enables you to implement a secure, BYOD mobile strategy, and delivers native apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. No matter which mobile operating system or device you use, the ONE experience is the same – a robust productivity stream, integrated approvals, and easy-to-setup micro-apps. Pre-Built Micro-Apps Each user gets a custom set of micro-apps. With our pre-built micro-apps you provide immediate value and jumpstart your mobile initiative. Pre-built or custom micro-apps can be assigned in real-time to users based on roles, geography, etc. and are instantly available within the ONE app. ONE also provides a Microsoft Visual Studio based AppBuilder to create custom micro-apps that are built upon pre-packaged ONE capabilities (like push notifications, cards, single-sign-on, etc.). Create Custom Mobile Scenarios in Days not Weeks Skill shortage is a major threat for mobilizing your enterprise. Sitrion ONE lets you leverage your Microsoft .NET expertise instead of hiring rare iOS or Android talent. Check out our Visual Studio based AppBuilder and our native apps, and say goodbye to costly development costs and service providers. This smart approach helps you to save up to 90% of development cost and accelerates time to market by 87%. Enterprise Security in the Cloud Sitrion ONE comes with a cloud-based architecture. The Sitrion ONE cloud platform provides all core capabilities like administration, role management, notifications, tasks, single-sign on, and backend integrations. ONE ensures secure access to all sensitive backend data with or without Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Mobile Application Management (MAM) solutions. Additionally it leverages your Active Directory Infrastructure. Powerful Backend Integration Developing corporate mobile applications is costly. In fact backend integrations account for the majority of costs. Sitrion ONE comes with standard connectors to enterprise systems like SAP, SharePoint, Exchange, Office365, and Salesforce. ONE gives you the freedom to create custom micro-apps blending SAP data, SharePoint documents and Social comments. Best-in-Class ROI & TCO Due to its smart design, our enterprise mobility solution delivers compelling commercial benefits for your enterprise particularly when you are planning to mobilize dozens of use cases. 90% Less Development Costs Redundant coding for multiple ecosystems, user experiences, and backend integrations drive up costs for enterprise apps.
