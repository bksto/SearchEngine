Designed for prospective undergraduates only (no parents allowed), the forum is an informal gathering where current high school students can learn all about what it’s like to go to Stanford. This session is not meant to be a replacement for the Discover Stanford information session, but rather a supplement to our other programming. Please note that admission questions will not be answered during these sessions.

Prospective Students: Planning a Spring Visit? We strongly encourage prospective students planning a visit to do so either before March 14 or after April 7 in order to maximize the value of the visit. These are our busiest weeks of the year, and they coincide with Stanford's final exams and our own Spring Break — large crowds are thus paired with limited offerings and greatly reduced tour guide staffing. To truly get a sense of what Stanford is like, come during an academic quarter in order to sit in on classes, enjoy smaller tour groups, and take part in special interest tours and programs. For more information, please contact us at (650) 723-2560 during business hours. View Schedule & Register Campus Tours & Programs The schedule shows availability for all tours.
