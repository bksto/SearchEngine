He was given the award during the ASA national meetings in San Francisco. The award is for the best published article in the past two years in the area of globalization studies. The research examined the localities in El Salvador and Costa Rica that were most likely to mobilize against the privatization of public health services and public utilities using count regression models and GIS mapping techniques. Those communities with more extensive economic and social infrastructures such as transportation networks, public universities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and oppositional political parties were more likely to galvanize local collective action campaigns to protect themselves from loss of access to state-sponsored services such as medical care. The article formed the basis of his new book with Johns Hopkins University Press.
