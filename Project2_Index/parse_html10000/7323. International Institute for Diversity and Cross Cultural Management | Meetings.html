How does it differ from a regular workshop? A colloquium is usually of an academic nature and is meant to garner the views of others. The presenters at colloquium present topics and then analyze and discuss a particular topic. A conference is a meeting where information is exchanged or discussed, but not necessarily of an academic nature. The proceedings at a conference usually follow a formal agenda, and presenters are not necessarily a scholar or anyone with an academic affiliation.
