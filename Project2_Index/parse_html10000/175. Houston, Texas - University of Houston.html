Known as the energy capital of the world, the city is home to 26 Fortune 500 companies, the second most in the nation, and the world's largest medical center — making Houston a land of limitless opportunities for UH students, whether through internships or fieldwork experiences in the real world. The opportunities are so unlimited, that 63% of UH Alumni live and work in the city. Houston also has the fastest growing economy in the country, and the University of Houston plays a vital role by generating $3 billion for the city every year. Houston has been ranked #1 city for recent college graduates by msnNOW. The survey ranked major cities by a combination of job growth, affordable living and vibrant 20-something populations. Houston's quality of life and proximity to research partners in business and government also make the city an attractive home for talented professors and their families. Houston is an entertaining place to live, too. Forbes Magazine took notice of all the culture the city has to offer, recently naming Houston, “America’s Coolest City,” a testament to what Houstonians have known for years. Whether you want to take in a show in the Theater District that boasts more than 12,000 seats, eat at one of the 11,000 restaurants, cheer on a local sports team or anything in between, Houston offers something for everyone.
