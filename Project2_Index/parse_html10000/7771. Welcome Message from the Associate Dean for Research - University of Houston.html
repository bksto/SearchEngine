This is an important position in supporting faculty and the College’s efforts in identifying, applying, and successfully implementing funded research projects along with supporting the overall research vision of the College. The mission of the College of Education’s Office of Research is to provide leadership and support to advance the College of Education’s research mission of achieving greater local, state, national, and international prominence. Our office develops mechanisms that position faculty to secure external funding for innovative research; develops policies, initiatives, and training opportunities to increase innovative and impactful research; and supports faculty in finding funding opportunities, proposal development and submission, and post-award support. My leadership philosophy embraces the belief that leadership is a privilege; and one that does not automatically come with a particular position or title. It comes with a certain vision and disposition. My leadership philosophy is one of transformational leadership. Transformational leadership involves a belief and approach to develop the morale, motivation, and productivity of the team. Additionally, it also improves the morale, motivation, and productivity of the leader espousing to this model. Four core concepts in this leadership model include (a) individualized consideration, (b) intellectual stimulation, (c) inspirational motivation, and (d) idealized influence. I will continue to meet individually with faculty to identify their needs, concerns, and hopes for their research and scholarship as well as for their professional advancement in the academy. This will influence the development of research initiatives and new ‘soft skill approaches’ such as handwritten thank you and congratulation cards for faculty who submit grant proposals and receive funding. These individualized considerations directly address faculty needs, concerns, and hopes while demonstrating appreciation for their contributions to the overall team. My efforts toward intellectual stimulation are evidenced during individual and small-group mentorship when faculty are encouraged to ‘consider your science’ and how to apply their research expertise, or their science, toward innovative approaches and solutions with broad impact. Faculty should consider how to best utilize resources and opportunities available and also examine utilizing resourcefulness, entrepreneurship, and creativity to strengthen their research. Possessing and communicating a shared vision on a regular basis and leading by transparent example inspires motivation amongst constituents. Finally, idealized influence is evidenced when a leader demonstrates what one says in their actions and behaviors. I will do my best to exemplify these four components of transformational leadership with a strong emphasis on appreciation and consideration for all members of the collective team within the college, including faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate students. The goal is that individuals (faculty, staff, and students) are afforded the opportunity to have an indelible mark left on their personal and professional development, and for each member of the team to leave an indelible mark on the organization. I am excited to bring my experiences in research, grantsmanship, leadership, openness to feedback, and humility to my role as Associate Dean for Research in our College of Education to best contribute to the individual and collective development of faculty, staff, and students.
