Academics UC Merced’s three schools — the School of Engineering, School of Natural Sciences, and School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts — offer undergraduate and graduate programs, resources and laboratories that enrich students’ educational experience. Undergraduates can choose from 21 majors and 22 minors, while graduate students can choose to join one of the 12 graduate groups managed by more than 200 full-time faculty members. The campus also has many talented visiting professors and lecturers who come from leading universities across the nation. Additionally, undergraduate students can study abroad and conduct research under the mentorship of innovative professors. The campus’s state-of-the-art facilities offer many places to meet, study or work in laboratories. Graduate students apply what they learn in the classroom to the research they’re conducting in pursuit of their master’s or doctoral degrees. The close-knit atmosphere also means there are opportunities to cross disciplines and work with people in other fields to solve big problems. The opportunities to study, research and thrive will only grow as the campus reaches 10,000 students by 2020.    The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
