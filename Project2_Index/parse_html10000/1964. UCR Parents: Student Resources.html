Getting the Most Out of UCR Housing Services UCR Housing Services is committed to providing our students with safe, convenient, comfortable housing. We offer three housing styles to meet the needs of all students. Whether our students choose to live in residence halls, campus apartments or family housing, each provides the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities that will enrich their college experience. In addition, our campus police force, which patrols 24 hours a day, and our on-call housing staff are committed to providing a safe and secure environment. Dining Services UCR Dining Services offers more than great food – we provide a place where our students can take a break and gather with friends to socialize, study and relax. Whether it’s in the dining halls or our retail locations, we pride ourselves in providing a wide variety of high-quality, authentic and healthy options daily in a friendly, welcoming environment. Fees & Financial Aid Regardless of your income level, a wide range of financial aid options put UCR excellence within reach. In fact, 70 percent of all UCR students receive some form of financial aid. UCR encourages you to investigate all opportunities for financial assistance, including grants, loans and scholarships. See our annual budget of projected costs and learn more about financial aid options. In addition, our staff in Student Business Services can assist you with everything from payment and cashier services to loan and debt counseling. Registrar The Office of the Registrar is responsible for student registration, publishes class schedules, maintains academic records and distributes diplomas. It also upholds The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which governs and protects students’ rights to education records. R'Card The R'Card is your student’s single most important piece of student identification. But it’s also the quickest, most convenient way to pay for things on campus and access services. This multi-purpose ID allows students to gain access to buildings, pay for meals, borrow books from the library, ride public transportation for free, and use vending services – just to name a few benefits. Libraries UCR's libraries are among the UC’s most complete and among the largest academic research libraries in the United States. With 2 million volumes, 28,000 print and electronic serial subscriptions, 1.7 million microforms, 300,000 government information sources, and access to 165,000 e-books, we’re ready to connect our students with the resources they need. Academic Advising Whether your student is an incoming freshman, or a senior trying to figure out his or her next step, there are academic advisors at UCR to help them figure out the right path to success. The First Year Success series and First Year Learning Communities are designed to help students navigate their first year at UCR, explore what the university has to offer, meet new friends – all while excelling academically. Our Learning Center is a team of educators, counselors, and advanced students who provide a variety of free services to help all students succeed in their classes. Our Career Center offers counseling to help students decide what major fits them and what careers suit them. Our goal is that our students always have someone to talk to and help them successfully navigate their years at UCR.
