Go Far, Go Bradley! Amy L. Turk '97 President, BUAA A Message from the Vice President for Advancement Your alma mater is working very hard to strengthen the bond between its alumni and the university. Alumni are crucial to the present and, most importantly, the future of Bradley University. Her success depends on a thriving, energetic, and engaged alumni base in order to advance the best interests of the university. The Bradley University Alumni Association (BUAA) was created more than 100 years ago to serve and engage all alumni – and future alumni – for this purpose. We understand just how important your connection to Bradley is. Through this web site, along with the online community BUconnect, we will keep you informed about the limitless opportunities available to you to interact with your university, your classmates, or your professional colleagues. If you have not been engaged with Bradley, I encourage you to browse our web site to begin. Take a fresh look at the services we will provide you and the opportunities for you to reconnect with that part of your Bradley experience you most cherish. Today, we number more than 70,000 alumni worldwide. Both the Alumni Association and the Department of Alumni Relations have worked diligently to better serve our broad constituency. We continue to be a “work in progress” as they say, and therefore welcome your comments and feedback about how we’re doing, and how we can better serve. You chose Bradley for your higher education. Now, choose Bradley again—choose to connect, choose to engage, choose to serve. Together, we can ensure Bradley's future as an institution of national distinction. The best is yet to come!
