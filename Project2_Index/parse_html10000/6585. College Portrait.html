College Portrait of Undergraduate Education Skip To Content Accessibility Admin Login Home Compare Contact About Resources Accessibility and the College Portrait As more information and services are being delivered to students and their families via the internet it becomes increasingly important to deliver content that can be accessed by all users, regardless of the device or technology (assistive or otherwise) used to access that information. There are significant challenges in developing an accessible web service whose scope encompasses (this is a partial list); a form based data entry module with contextual help, application logic for raw processing of institutional research data, import of multiple file formats, data driven display pages, and dynamically generated accessible graphs. In addition, the challenge of creating a site that does not compromise on accessibility, but that is also graphically rich and browser compliant can be daunting. With limited resources, focus was given to core structures, the separation of content and style, semantic construction where possible and a commitment to engage accessibility requirements and protocols early in the development process. As user testing and feedback drive the development of the site forward, we are committed to improving functional accessibility and general usability through the judicious application of standards based development and open standards.
