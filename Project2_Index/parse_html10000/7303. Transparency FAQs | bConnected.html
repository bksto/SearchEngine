Read more about Does UCB have a published procedure for law enforcement to follow when making a request? Does UCB commit to tell users when an order has come in from a subpoena unless there's a gag order? Yes, per ECP Section IV.B.3, “Notification: The responsible authority or designee shall at the earliest opportunity that is lawful and consistent with other University policy notify the affected individual of the action(s) taken and the reasons for the action(s) taken.” The notification requirements are applicable for subpoenas and other non-consensual access (including internal requests).

You need to fill out the following form: Campus Approval of Non-Consensual Access to Electronic Communication Records (PDF). Once you do, you will find out if your request was approved or denied. Also, see below for the process for law enforcement requests. Read more about What should I do if I want to get non-consensual access to someone’s account? So the government can look at my email? There are limits to bConnected transparency. For example, the US security apparatus, with their ability to serve Google with gag-order National Security Letters, can bypass the University without us being able to engage via an understandable legal process. Also, unencrypted email traverses the Internet in plaintext, which can be intercepted and read by third-parties. Read more about So the government can look at my email? Under what circumstances might someone other than UCB look at my email without me knowing? The bConnected team sometimes gets requests from government, law enforcement, or internal campus authorities asking for access without the record holders knowledge or consent. When required by law or UC policy to comply with such a request, we will do so. Read more about Under what circumstances might someone other than UCB look at my email without me knowing? Do systems administrators look through my email? System administrators have access to campus email accounts, but they use principles of “least perusal”, and only access accounts when it’s absolutely necessary to maintain stability of operations or assist users who have asked them to investigate problems. Read more about Do systems administrators look through my email? What is the difference between the Transparency Report and the annual report required by the Electronic Communications Policy? Our Transparency Report provides more detailed information than the ECP requires. It’s also specific to UC Berkeley, and not other UC campuses.  Read more about What is the difference between the Transparency Report and the annual report required by the Electronic Communications Policy? What is the The UC Electronic Communications Policy (ECP)? The ECP is a system-wide document that establishes policy on allowable use and privacy of electronic communications, and also clarifies limits on privacy protections.
