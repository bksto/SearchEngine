A complete list of department mail codes can be found here. It is not necessary to include building name or room number. Example: Addressee name John Smith Department name Mail Services Mail code 8617 Addressing Campus Mail All outgoing mail should have a return address printed or typed in the upper left hand corner. You should include your name and your full department name and mail code. This will ensure proper recharging of postage costs, as well as the proper return of undeliverable mail. The US Post Office has assigned 93106 as the unique zip code for UCSB. Any letters or packages using this zip code will be delivered to Mail Services, and then routed to your department. Generally, using this zip code, along with your mail code, is all that is needed to ensure your mail and packages are delivered properly. However, there are times when vendors and couriers will require a street address (number). In those cases you can use 552 University Road as the street address for any department on campus. Example: "Your Department Name" 552 University Road Santa Barbara, CA 93106-"your mail code" It is important to include a Zip Code on all outgoing mail. Using your department's mail code will encourage your correspondent to use the same when replying. This will help expedite mail through the U.S. Postal System and campus. Off-campus mail for the campus includes First and Standard-Class rates. All special class mailings (registered, express, certified and insured) and international mail must be accompanied with the appropriate forms. All outgoing mail should be bundled with addresses facing forward. Remember - only UCSB business-related mail may be sent through Mail Services. Outgoing mail is dispatched to the U.S. Postal Service each day at 4:30 pm. Any mail received after 3:30 pm may go out with the next day's mail. Postage Metered Mail Outgoing mail requiring postage is processed through meter machines at Mail Services. Meter machines cannot seal over- stuffed envelopes. Do not use binder clips or paper clips on envelopes or on contents of mail that requires metering. Stamps If you need postage stamps for your department, submit a written request to Mail Services. Postage stamps are delivered by a Mail Service Representative, signed for by the requester, and recharged to your department. Preparation of International Mail To expedite international mail, the USPS requires customs forms, which can be obtained from Mail Services. This USPS website will be helpful in preparing your International Mail: http://about.usps.com/publications/pub613/welcome.htm International mail weighing under 14 oz. does not need a customs form unless the item is a small packet or padded mailer.  Items weighing between 14 oz. and 4 lbs. should have a USPS customs form #2976.  For items weighing OVER 4lbs. use customs form #2976-A.  These forms cannot be used in place of a mailing address label. Customs forms are not required for domestic mail. Recharge All outgoing mail is charged back to the originating department's default LVPA (Low Value Purchase Authorization) number unless Mail Services is instructed otherwise. If you need to identify a new or change an existing default LVPA for mail recharges, please fill out the Default LVPA Designation Form and submit it to Mail Services. If you need to set up a new LVPA for your mail recharges, you may do so by using the on-line ALLN01 system. You can also request Purchasing do this for you by submitting a Request for Low Value Purchase Authorization form to them. IMPORTANT NOTES If you have identified a default LVPA, it will be routinely used for all mail charges unless you furnish Mail Services with different instructions at the time of service (simply attach a note designating an alternate LVPA to charge). If you have not identified a default LVPA, your mail may be delayed, as we will need to contact you for this important information. Envelopes Outgoing mail should be: Enclosed in white, #10 standard (9 1/2" x 4 1/8") envelopes whenever possible. Sealed or "flapped" (aligned with flaps open) to facilitate postal metering. Note: Large, very small, or bulky envelopes must be sealed by originating department personnel. Return Address on official UCSB mail must identify the originating department or office. This assures proper return of undeliverable mail and correct recharging of department. Call us in advance if you have an unusually large mailing so that we can bring the proper equipment to handle your mail. Shape Based Standards The minimum size and non-standard regulations for First- and Standard-Class mail are as follows: Oversized Pieces All First-Class mail will be subject to a surcharge if the length is greater than 11.5 inches and/or thickness greater than .25 inches. Odd-Sized Pieces There is a height to length ratio for all First-Class mail. The length must be between 1.3 times and 2.5 times the height. Non-Mailable Pieces Pieces less than 3.5 inches high, 5 inches long and .007 inches thick will be considered non-mailable. Also, a non-machinable surcharge may apply on pieces weighing 1 ounce or less. Size standards for Express Mail, Priority Mail, Parcel Post, and Media Mail are: Maximum weight 70 lbs. Maximum size 108 inches (length+girth) US Mail First class Mail Includes letters, postal cards, and other mailable pieces. Second Class Mail (periodicals) Is primarily for use by publishers and news agents for mailing newspapers and periodicals in large or bulk quantities. Media Mail Is used for printed matter not containing First Class matter. Parcel Post Mail Includes printed matter or merchandise weighing 16 ounces or more. Library Rate and Media Mail Includes books, printed music, bound volumes of academic theses, sound recordings, periodicals and other library materials, in printed, duplicated or photographic form. This rate applies when these items are loaned or exchanged between schools, colleges or universities and public libraries. Each package mailed under this classification must have the statement "Library Rate." The address or return address must show the name of the educational institution, library, or nonprofit organization. International Mail Requirements for foreign destinations vary and are generally more exacting than domestic mail.
