It has been said that being an Aggie doesn't just define where you went to school, it defines who you are. Many of Texas A&M's more than 370,000 former students are icons in their career and pillars of their community. The distinctive Aggie Ring, designed more than 100 years ago, serves as the symbolic link to the Aggie network of former students. Through the A&M Foundation, 12th Man Foundation, and The Association of Former Students, former students provide tangible evidence of their deep-rooted loyalty to their alma mater by contributing millions of dollars each year to support Texas A&M and Aggies.
