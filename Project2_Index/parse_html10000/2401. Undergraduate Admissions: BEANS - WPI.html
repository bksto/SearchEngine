The Boston Area Extended Network of Schools (BEANS) Tour provides counselors with the opportunity to explore five outstanding colleges with your colleagues from around the world. Counselors will meet with admissions representatives, current students, faculty, and explore the cities of Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts!  Expenses, including transportation and lodging, will be covered by BEANS. The exception is dinner Monday evening when counselors have the opportunity to take full advantage of Boston's culinary delights on their own! Flight reservations must be made through the BEANS-designated travel agent. Due to scheduling and costs, the Tour reserves the right to fly counselors into Boston on Saturday, April 11, in which case the Tour will absorb the additional night at the hotel (based upon double occupancy). Return flights will be scheduled no earlier than 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, April 15. We look forward to seeing you on our campuses in April! The RSVP deadline is December 31. If you wish to register for the 2015 tour, please complete the form below. Tour participation is not guaranteed until receipt of written confirmation from the BEANS planning committee. Detailed information will be sent on January 19, 2015. Please feel free to contact Kait Gentile at 508-831-5286 or kgentile@wpi.edu if you have any questions. Please note that at the Boston hotel, single occupancy rooms are an additional cost of $130 per night.   Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Academic Programs WPI At-a-Glance Living at WPI Your Perspective Applying to WPI Visit with Us Meet the Team Information Sessions & Campus Tours Saturday Visits Open Houses Personal Interviews Office Hours and Parking BEANS Contacts Frequently Asked Questions Travel Information Virtual Tour Online College Fairs Pre-College Opportunities Request Information Admissions Calendar + There are currently no events in the calendar.
