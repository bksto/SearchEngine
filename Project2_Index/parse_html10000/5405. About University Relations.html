Their commitment to communicating creatively about the people and programs at UC Santa Cruz helps to build enduring relationships with alumni and friends of the campus. This hard work is essential to securing critically needed private gifts. Every aspect of the division's work is done in support of a campus that is a jewel of the University of California system. Whether in a classroom or research setting, UC Santa Cruz people are renowned for the quality of their work, for doing the unexpected, and for challenging conventional thinking; in the process, they are changing the world. To effectively support a special campus, UR is organized into five units: Communications & Marketing, Constituent Engagement, Government and Community Relations, Strategic Philanthropy, and Operatons & Planning.
