The UCLA weather forecast is usually updated once a day by noon (work days only). A second update may follow before 4 PM as conditions warrant. The purpose of the forecast is to give persons working or living around campus an idea of what to expect weather-wise. If noteworthy weather exists outside of the campus region, it will be noted in the Detailed Forecast. Most media forecasts, whose sources are either the National Weather Service or private forecasting companies, predict the weather around downtown L.A., but the weather can vary greatly between downtown and Westwood.
