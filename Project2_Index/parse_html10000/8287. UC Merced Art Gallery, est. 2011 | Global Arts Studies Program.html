Our dedicated student curators, enrolled in Wang's museum and curatorial studies courses to acquire historical and theoretical knowledge, as well as hands-on skills, have helped make the gallery a success. We have received more than 2,500 visitors in four years, and we hope to continue to offer original and interdisciplinary programs in the future. Hours: Mon-Thurs, 11-3pm Location: The UCM gallery is located in north campus in the Social Sciences & Management building (SSM) in room 106. Parking: Visitor parking permits may be obtained from the permit dispensing machine in Lake Lot 1 and 2, Evolution Valley lots and visitor spaces in Library Lot 1. Visitor permits are only valid in the lot from where they are purchased.  Once parked, place your permit in your car window, and then walk up Scholars Lane. After you pass the New Beginnings statue and cross Ansel Adams road, you will see our building SSM (Social Sciences and Management) on your right. The second entrance is the gallery.
