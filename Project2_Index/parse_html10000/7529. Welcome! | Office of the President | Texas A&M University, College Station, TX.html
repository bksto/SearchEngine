It is an honor and privilege to serve as interim president of Texas A&M. I applaud the efforts of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents and Chancellor Sharp for identifying and selecting an outstanding individual to serve as the next president of Texas A&M University. Michael K. Young is highly regarded around the nation for his proven record of success as a teacher, researcher, public servant and visionary university leader. I look forward to working closely with President Young during his transition to Aggieland as I return to my role as Vice Chancellor and Dean for Agriculture and Life Sciences. It’s a great time for Texas A&M University.  On a more personal note, I’d like to thank members of the Board of Regents and Chancellor Sharp for allowing me to serve as Interim President of Texas A&M during the search process. I am especially grateful to the faculty, staff, students and Former Students of Texas A&M for their support during the past year. Mark A.
