Account Activity Lists all the transactions posted to the student account over a fixed period of time and includes charges, payments and financial aid refunds. The detailed breakdown supports the totals in the account summary. Charges Due Lists all outstanding charges and deposits that have been incurred to date and includes a summary, details by due date and details of charges. Payments Lists all payments posted to the account, including financial aid and scholarship disbursements. Pending Financial Aid Lists pending or anticipated aid that has NOT yet been posted/disbursed to the account.  Pending financial aid amounts can be viewed by all terms or by specific terms. Notes Your payments must be received by the due dates to prevent a hold being placed on your account.  A hold will prevent you from receiving a transcript and registering for courses and can only be released when fees are paid. Your account may also be subject to collection action if the bill has been outstanding for 90 days or longer.  Additional penalties may be assessed and/or your account will be referred to a collection agency.
