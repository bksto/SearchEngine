Acceptable Use Policy Policy notice:
Please familiarize yourself with the following policies before applying for an ASU network ID. Failure to comply with these policies may result in the loss of network privileges. 
Network IDs are issued to registered ASU students only. 


If you maintain continuous enrollment at ASU, your network ID will continue to be valid. If you drop from school, your network ID and all associated files will be removed on the 11th class day of the following fall or spring semester. If you return to school after an absence of a semester or more a new network ID will be issued to you. 


Copyrighted computer software 

Be aware that software is protected by international copyright laws. However, illegal copies of protected software are often made available illegally from the Internet and other sources. Before receiving or making a duplicate of any software product, students should determine if the software producer allows such duplicates to be made or distributed legally. 

Failure to comply with the conditions related to any software product is considered a basis for disciplinary action toward the offending person. 

Computer ethics 

Each student computer user at Arkansas State University is responsible for his/her actions regarding general computer usage and network access. Free and open access to computing resources is provided within the guidelines outlined in this statement. 

Any attempt to obtain or utilize another individual's computer/network account, to use or abuse information from another user's files without his/her permission, or to intentionally attempt to adversely affect the computing of others, will result in immediate cancellation of computing privileges. The offending individual will also be referred to the appropriate University Vice President for disciplinary action. 

During busy periods when lab computers and dial-up resources are heavily utilized, non-university required activities such as game playing and electronic chatting may be restricted. If an individual does not cease these activities when asked to do so, his/her computing account will be removed and he/she may be referred to the appropriate University Vice President for disciplinary action. 

The use of computing should demonstrate respect for other users. Network activities such as propagation of obscenity or pornography, the sending of "chain letters", or other activities which cause congestion or impact the work of others may also result in the loss of an account and subsequent disciplinary action.
