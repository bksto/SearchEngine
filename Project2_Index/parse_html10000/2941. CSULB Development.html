Moving Forward We are proud of this growth but realize that if we are to build on our momentum and secure our future, we must gain the support of private partners who understand the importance of providing educational experiences of the highest caliber to a large and diverse student body. With help from forward-looking friends and alumni, CSULB will be able to seize new opportunities for growth while staying true to our student-centered mission. Your support and involvement help ensure student access and success; strengthen teaching and research initiatives; and expand and enhance classrooms, laboratories, studios, training rooms, and other key facilities. Join Us! CSULB offers a wide range of inspiring investment opportunities – opportunities to achieve your personal philanthropic goals while advancing an institution you care deeply about. If you would like more information about our campus or programs, please feel free to contact me – or any of our development officers. We appreciate your interest and look forward to hearing from you!
