By Laurie Williams, Correspondent Posted: 02/26/15, 12:01 AM PST | Updated: 1 week, 1 day ago # Comments Orchestras often play for the benefit of dancers — so it’s a special event every year in Redlands when the roles reverse and dancers perform for the benefit of an orchestra. The Redlands Symphony’s 30th annual fundraiser gala, set for June 6 in the Orton Center at the University of Redlands, will spotlight the group’s eighth annual “Dancing with the Stars” contest. “This has always been a big crowd-pleaser,” said DWTS coordinator Mary Jo Holmes. “People in the community get a kick out of supporting their favorite dancers and from seeing the performances.” The event partners instructors from Fox Dance Studio and Arthur Murray Dance Studio in Redlands with community leaders who spend the months leading up to the gala practicing their moves and getting their friends and associates to donate money. Each dollar donated, whether before the event or at the gala, counts as one vote. Whoever gets the most votes wins the contest. The RSO usually raises about $30,000, Holmes said. Already taking dance lessons and raising money are six community leaders whose names were released this week by the RSO. They are Shirley Harry, Joe Henehan, Toni Momberger, Bryan Reid, Art Svenson and Lara Urrutia. For several decades, award-winning Realtor Shirley Harry has been deeply involved in the arts and with community organizations such as YWCA, the United Way, the Cultural Foundation, P.E.O. and the Rotary Club of Redlands. She plans to dance to “The Merry Widow Waltz” because she loves listening to the music: “It inspires me.” Insurance expert Joe Henehan is also known as a singer and dancer in community theater productions: “I love to dance. I’m looking forward to learning my routine and being a part of the showcase on Gala night. We love Redlands, and I’m excited about helping raise money to help the Redlands Symphony continue its role in making this a special place to live.” Redlands native Toni Momberger is in her fourth year as editor of the Redlands Daily Facts, and is a member of Redlands Sunrise Rotary and AAUW. She was honored in 2013 as the Digital First Media national Journalist of the Year for her commitment to serving the community her paper covers. “I am honored and proud to be contributing to the success of the Gala and the Redlands Symphony,” she said. “It’s one of the things that makes Redlands a desirable community.” Civil trial lawyer Bryan Reid loves outdoor activities, including surfing, hiking, kayaking and exploring. He’s an avid follower of the LA Kings. “I am looking forward to being referred to as a ‘star’ for a period of months,” he said. “As a longtime trial lawyer, I have been referred to with many different and interesting superlatives. ‘Star’ has never been one of them.” Advertisement Art Svenson is principal second violin for the RSO and teaches political science at the University of Redlands. As a musician, he describes his tenure with the symphony as “joyful, sublime, ridiculously passionate, challenging, and filled with moments that will last a lifetime.” The ensemble is his best friend forever, he said. “I’m delighted to have yet another way to support this wonderful organization.” Pianist Lara Urrutia teaches and studies at the University of Redlands School of Music. “Since my student days at the U of R, the symphony has held a special place in my heart,” she said. “I was very fortunate as an undergrad to have played with the Redlands Symphony, so having the chance to pay it forward by fundraising is a wonderful opportunity for me.” Much like the cast of the ABC-TV show of the same name, most Redlands “Dancing with the Stars” pairs put in long hours of practice, said Holmes, who danced in the event in 2011. But technically, she said, you don’t have to be a good dancer to win. “They can stand on the dance floor and do nothing and still win,” Homes said. “Whereas we do love a performance, you can just stand there and juggle or something, and if you have the most votes you’ll be the winner.” Invitations to the Gala, which also includes cocktails, dinner and silent and live auctions, cost $125 per person and are available through the RSO office, 909-748-8018. A limited number of platinum tickets are available for $150 per person. They include reserved premium dance floor seating.
