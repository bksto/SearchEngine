The School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts offers a broad range of programs dedicated to preparing students for varied roles as responsible and thoughtful citizens and leaders. We offer research and academic programs in anthropology, the arts, cognitive science, economics, foreign languages, history, literatures and cultures, management, philosophy, political science, psychology, sociology and world heritage that: prepare students for meaningful careers and professions; encourage intellectual and moral growth; promote sound decision-making; instill the values of lifelong learning; and encourage civic responsibility, public service, and understanding in a diverse, global society. Students have the opportunity to follow personal paths of discovery in disciplinary or interdisciplinary curricula, while at the same time gaining depth and expertise in methodological domains such as social statistics, historiography, Geographic Information Systems, economics, cultural analysis and cognitive science. Culture, society, and artistic expression differ widely on the basis of their historical era and geographical location. Individuals and their cultures are affected by diverse natural environments, the questions we ask about ourselves and the world, the changing ways in which the world has been measured and envisioned, and the legacies of contacts, migrations or isolation. As students learn to understand the ways that time and place have shaped lives, institutions and works of the imagination, they develop perspectives that enable them to better understand and shape our futures.
