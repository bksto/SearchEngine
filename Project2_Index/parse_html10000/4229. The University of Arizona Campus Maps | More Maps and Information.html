The University of Arizona Enterprise GIS CAMPUS MAPS HOME MORE MAPS AND INFORMATION ENTERPRISE GIS MENU About the Enterprise GIS The Enterprise Geographic Information System (EGIS) is the University's system of record for up-to-date campus map information. The EGIS integrates a range of spatial data and campus information into a coherent framework and provides access to this information through web map services and applications as well as through direct access to the UA Enterprise GeoDatabase. The EGIS is a service of the department of Planning, Design, and Construction (PDC). Please contact Grant McCormick, GIS Manager, at 520-626-4416 about our services and getting involved. Services Enterprise GeoDatabase The Enterprise GeoDatabase is a multi-editor shared GIS data warehouse built using ESRI SDE technology with a SQL Server backend. Numerous campus features are mapped within this database, which provides much of the data on our web maps. The database is a shared resource that allows distributed ownership of parts of the data by various department on campus, which leverages the benefits of a common data format, coordinate reference, and more. Web Map Applications The EGIS hosts a number of web map application which are built around enterprise GIS data. EGIS staff develops, or manages development of these applications internally or as part of collaborative campus teams. GIS Server Infrastructure and Map Services EGIS manages the GIS server infrastructure needed for our web maps, and also publishes map services available for other web map mashups such that developers are provided with up to date information upon which to base their applications. Custom Maps, Reports, Analyses Project specific maps, reports, analyses, and data conversions are provided on an as needed basis. Project Management and Scoping EGIS scopes and manages internal projects as well as provides assistance to campus departments with their GIS projects.
