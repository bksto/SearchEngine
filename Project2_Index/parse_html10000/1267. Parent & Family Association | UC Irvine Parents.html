Its goal is to foster an environment of community support for students by helping to enrich the opportunities, reputation and visibility of campus programs, and by promoting the UC Irvine values: respect, intellectual curiosity, integrity, commitment, empathy, appreciation and fun. What We Do UCI P&FA members are involved with UCI on various levels, including participation in university and community events and issues. Members have opportunities to meet, become acquainted and discuss topics of mutual interest or concern with other P&FA members both at UCI and in their home areas, and focus on staying in touch with aspects of student life and events at UCI. How We Help Members participate by sharing the benefit of their expertise or their personal and professional associations with the university, its students and one another. This can take place through volunteer opportunities such as participating in P&FA event committees, serving as regional points of contact for other parents and students, attending regional events, or by identifying and encouraging promising students to consider attending UCI. Membership Benefits The P&FA is a valuable resource for parents and family members whenever questions arise about UCI, your student or campus issues. As a member you will receive: Connections to other UCI parents and family members and the campus community Tips and information to help support your student An exclusive invitation to the P&FA’s annual “Breakfast with the Vice Chancellor” A subscription to AnteaterNews, the P&FA’s e-newsletter Invitations and priority notification of informative and fun campus and community events Opportunities to assist at UCI-sponsored events Join the UCI Parent & Family Association (pdf) » Contact UCI Parent & Family Association 949.824.7759 parents@uci.edu SEARCH DATES & EVENTS UCI Quarterly Academic Calendars 2014-15 Academic Year » Student Housing Important Dates 2014-15 Student Housing Important Dates » Front Door Software License Free laptop loss & recovery protection »   Follow this site Receive an email notification when new content is posted.
