The Reverse Transfer agreement permits former Jefferson Davis Community College students who transfer to Troy University to transfer eligible credits back to JDCC for the purpose of attaining an associate degree. Students qualified for reverse transfer will have earned at least 15 semester credit hours from JDCC, will have earned at least three semester credit hours from Troy University, and will be in good standing at both institutions. Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr., Chancellor of Troy University, said there has always been a strong link between the Alabama Community College System and TROY and that such agreements make good sense.
