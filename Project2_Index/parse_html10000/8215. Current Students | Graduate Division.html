Everyone is very excited about their research. It’s a younger group and it shows in their enthusiasm, not only in their own research, but also in getting other people involved in it.” Jason Davis, Applied Mathematics   Contact Us Graduate Admissions: Phone: (209) 228-4723 gradadmissions@ucmerced.edu      Graduate Funding: Phone: (209) 228-4622 gradfunding@ucmerced.edu      General Inquiries: Phone: (209) 228-4723 Fax: (209) 228-6906 graddiv@ucmerced.edu      Mailing Address: University of California, Merced ATTN: Graduate Division 5200 N.
