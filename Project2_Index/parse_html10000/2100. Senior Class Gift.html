Once a Toro, Always A Toro Prior classes left their legacy: The Class of 2014 supported the University Fitness Center to ensure continued maintenance and enhancement of the facility. The Class of 2013 supported the University Library so that additional iPads can be purchased and meet the demands of the laptop loan program. The Class of 2012 left their legacy by donating two scholarships to the winners of ASI Toro Tuesdays. What is a Senior Class Gift? It is a fundraising campaign among the Class of 2015 seniors that raises money to support undergraduate financial aid, student group and community center funding, and academic programs. The Senior Class Gift has an immediate and lasting impact on the next generation of CSUDH students. The money does not go toward an endowment. It will be spent immediately and used to help current students. By making a gift of $20.15 or more to the iGave campaign, you will help CSUDH continue to meet the needs of students.
