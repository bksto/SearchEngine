Through national, international, and regional conferences; competitions; and publications, the Institute provides an international forum for presenting and sharing research in the study of decision processes across disciplines. The Institute also plays a vital role in the academic community by offering professional development activities and job placement services. Five regional subdivisions in the United States, as well as regions representing Europe, Mexico, Asia-Pacific and the Indian subcontinent, operate independently within the Institute (see regions). Each region has its own elected officers and representative on the board of directors and holds annual meetings. The Institute, an independent non-profit educational organization, is located in Houston, Texas, where it receives extensive support from the C.T. Bauer College of Business, University of Houston. Mission The Decision Sciences Institute advances the science and practice of decision making. We are an international professional association with an inclusive and cross-disciplinary philosophy. We are guided by the core values of high quality, responsiveness and professional development.     C.T. Bauer: College of Business | University of Houston Vision The Decision Sciences Institute is dedicated to excellence in fostering and disseminating knowledge pertinent to decision making. DSI History In November 1968, a small group of faculty members representing a national cross-section of schools met in Atlanta to lay the groundwork for an organization that would encourage interdisciplinary communication in the emerging field of decision sciences. A year later, about 100 charter members met in New Orleans to hold the first annual meeting of the American Institute for the Decision Sciences (renamed Decision Sciences Institute in 1986). The annual meeting now draws over 1,500 participants who are interested in active dialogue in the now well-established discipline. The Institute's flagship journal, Decision Sciences, first published in 1970, is now a highly recognized publication among practitioners and academicians. The beginning of our organization can be traced to a letter sent by Dennis Grawoig on April 10, 1968, to approximately 1000 faculty members at colleges or schools of business business, promoting the idea "of developing some type of association for business school faculty members interested in the quantitative area." Dennis Grawoig served as Executive Director from 1969 until his retirement in 1985. Following Grawoig's retirement, Carol J. Latta filled the Executive Director position for the Institute and led the home office operations until her untimely passing in June 2013. In 2013, the DSI board of directors distributed a request for proposals to other universities that might be interested in housing the Institute. In the November 2013 board meeting, competing proposals were considered and the board voted to accept a proposal from the Bauer College of Business at The University of Houston as the new location for the DSI home office. The new home office in Houston opened in April 2014.  The Institute was located at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Georgia from its founding in 1968 until April 2014. See 1989 Decision Line article by Past President Bernard Taylor of Virginia Tech about the first 20 years of DSI. Excerpt: Since this year's annual meeting in New Orleans will mark the twentieth anniversary of the Institute, I would like to take this opportunity to provide a brief history of our organization. This will serve to recognize some of the milestone events in the Institute as well as acknowledge a few of the many important contributors to our success. However, before beginning, let me note that I have compiled this history from somewhat limited information, and thus I offer an apology in advance for those important events and individuals I unintentionally omit.
