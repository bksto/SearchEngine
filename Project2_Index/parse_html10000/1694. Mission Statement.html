About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > Office of the President > Mission Statement Mission Statement The University of Redlands is a private, independent liberal arts university committed to providing a personalized education that frees students to make enlightened choices. Redlands emphasizes academic rigor, curricular diversity and innovative teaching. Redlands fosters a community of scholars and encourages a pluralistic notion of values by challenging assumptions and stereotypes in both classes and activities. A Redlands education goes beyond training to embrace a reflective understanding of our world; it proceeds from information to insight, from knowledge to meaning. Welcoming intellectually curious students of diverse religious, ethnic, national and socioeconomic backgrounds, the University seeks to develop responsible citizenship as part of a complete education. Redlands encourages a community atmosphere with exceptional opportunity for student leadership and interaction. For working adults, the University offers innovative academic programs at convenient locations and times. Redlands blends liberal arts and professional programs, applied and theoretical study, traditional majors and self-designed contracts for graduation. Small classes enable each student to participate in class discussion, to work closely with professors, and to receive extensive individual attention. Redlands remains sensitive to contemporary trends in society and challenges students to commit themselves to a lifetime of learning.
