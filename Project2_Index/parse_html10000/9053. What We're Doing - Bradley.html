We call these programs and policies Green Thread as they weave throughout our operations every day! Here are just a few ways we work to make our campus more environmentally conscious: Recycling: Dining Services partners with campus to recycle plastic, paper, and glass from all dining locations across campus. We are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint. Look for signs in our locations for information on where to put your recyclables. Community Outreach: Dining Services wants to provide well being for our campus community, as well as the surrounding Peoria area. Under the good Samaritan Act, we donate all unused food to the Heart of Illinois Harvest who distribute it to local food shelters and pantries. Trayless Dining: Did you know Dining Services has been trayless since 2012? By dining trayless, you have helped positively impact the waste stream. Dining trayless minimizes food waste, conserves energy and water, and reduces the amount of cleaning chemicals entering the waste stream. Reusables: Take part in our reusable mug program to reduce waste and receive a discount on fountain beverages and coffee in Stacks Cafe and the Student Center. Reusable To-Go Containers: Getting your meal to go from Geisert or Williams dining halls? Take part in our Reusable To-Go Container program. Here’s how it works: User can purchase an Eco-Takeout™ for $4.00 in Williams & Geisert Dining Hall. Cash, Credit Card, Dining Dollars, and Quick Cash accepted. User consumes food outside the dining hall. User rinses out Eco-Takeout™ container and returns it to Williams or Geisert Dining Hall to be washed and sanitized. In exchange, user will receive a token. Next time you would like to take food to go in Williams & Geisert Dining Hall, exchange your token for a clean Eco-Takeout ™. At the end of the school year, return your Eco-Takeout ™ container or token and be reimbursed the purchase price of $4.00. Fryer Oil Recycling: One hundred percent of dining services used fryer oil is recycled. Recycled Content Paper: We use recycled content office and copy paper in all dining locations on campus. Green Cleaning: All dining locations are committed to using daily green cleaning products in our operations to reduce the need for chemical based cleaning products and provide a healthy and safe learning environment. Energy & Water Conservation: We train our employees each semester on common energy and water conservation practices in order to conserve precious natural resources. Full Site
