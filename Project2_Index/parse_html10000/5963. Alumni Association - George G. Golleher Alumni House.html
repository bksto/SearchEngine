Golleher Alumni House was named after a generous key gift from George G. Golleher (BA Sociology ' 71) for complete internal and external renovation of the house. In addition to serving as a center for alumni activities, this Spanish Colonial Revival-style home is host to university sponsored events. The Golleher Alumni House is the perfect setting for intimate meetings for a few people or a classic setting for a reception for 250. Guests will journey through the garden courtyard and continue past the Fiesta Room to the terra cotta patio during special engagements.

This is a refreshing site for simple cocktail receptions and informal gatherings.
