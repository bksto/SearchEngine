During this period, there are five holidays and one day that would otherwise be a workday. Employees may take and charge Monday, December 31, 2014 as indicated below or they may elect to be docked this day, if they wish to use their time on the books at a later date.

If an employee does not have sufficient Vacation, CTO, or Personal Holiday time to cover the scheduled day of closure, they shall be provided sufficient work to prevent any loss of pay or benefits in accordance with the appropriate collective bargaining contracts or Trustee’s policy. If such work exceeds 40 hours per week for non-exempt employees (under the Fair Labor Standards Act), they are entitled to time and one-half compensation per the contracts. Sick leave cannot be granted during the campus closure unless the employee is officially scheduled to work during the closure. Employees who need to work should contact their supervisor by the first part of December to allow review time by the Dean or Director. The only offices that will remain open are those that are required to provide essential services. Such requests must be looked at on an individual basis. If you have any questions, please direct them to your department administrative assistant who will receive detailed instructions from the Division of Administration and Finance regarding the 2014 Holiday Closure.
