Engaged scholarship does not replace previous forms of scholarship.  Rather, faculty engagement serves to broaden and to deepen the possibilities for community and civic engagement across disciplines—and beyond the university. Engaged scholarship is defined by the collaboration between academics and individuals outside the academy— knowledge professionals and the lay public (local, regional/state, national, global)— for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. The scholarship of engagement includes explicitly democratic dimensions of encouraging the participation of non-academics in ways that enhance and broaden engagement and deliberation about major social issues inside and outside the university. It seeks to facilitate a more active and engaged democracy by bringing affected publics into problem-solving work in ways that advance the public good with and not merely for the public.     - New England Resource Center for Higher Education (NERCHE) © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
