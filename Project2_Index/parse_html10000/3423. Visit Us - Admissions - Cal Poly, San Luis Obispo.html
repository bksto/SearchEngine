Halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco with beaches in two directions, sits the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Boasting 43,000+ residents, the city and area has received much notice as a popular vacation spot. Notably, the city sits on California's El Camino Real, a historic trail that connected hundreds of miles on the west coast stretching from Baja California to Sonoma. Nicknamed 'SLO' to describe a pace of life for most residents, SLO's downtown hosts an internationally-renowned Thursday Night Farmer's Market that stretches for 5 city blocks. With a mixture of local produce, live music and quirky booths, this event happens throughout the year and continues to be a draw for tourists and locals alike. With beaches, hiking areas and biking trails just minutes from the campus, Cal Poly sits in an area that is both beautiful as it is dynamic. Make plans to visit Cal Poly and discover the SLO life!
