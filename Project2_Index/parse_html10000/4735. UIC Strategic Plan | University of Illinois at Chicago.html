In 2006 the campus produced the UIC Strategic Plan. In 2012 Chancellor Paula Allen-Meares introduced a set of six overarching goals for UIC following a broad, consultative process. Centralized planning has continued to occur across the campus in areas that accentuate UIC's unique strengths including the 2010 Campus Master Plan to advance our physical facilities, the Diversity Strategic Thinking and Planning process, and the UIC Undergraduate Student Success Plan.
