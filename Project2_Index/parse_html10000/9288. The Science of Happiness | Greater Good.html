Since it first launched in September, more than 150,000 students have registered for “The Science of Happiness.” And here is what they have to say: This is the most useful course I have ever taken. The materials that were offered in this course completely changed my perspective towards life. If there were a Mt. Everest version of recommendations, a pinnacle—a peak—that is where my recommendation for “The Science of Happiness” would be. I have the highest recommendation possible for the course. It’s been the most beautiful, inspiring, helpful, wonderful—beyond words really—course/educational opportunity I have ever experienced. I humbly bow to the awesome level of this course.—Lura Sanborn, ClassCentral.com It’s not too late to learn how to be happy. Join us this month… or next… or anytime before May 2015, to learn what science says about happiness and how to get it. The details: “The Science of Happiness” is a free online course that explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. The course is divided into eight one-week segments, but students can take at their own pace. Instructors Emiliana Simon-Thomas and Dacher Keltner Created by UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, the course zeroes in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social ties and contributing to something bigger than yourself—the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond. What’s more, “The Science of Happiness” will offer students practical strategies for nurturing their own happiness. Research suggests that up to 40 percent of happiness depends on our habits and activities. So each week, students will learn a new research-tested practice that fosters social and emotional well-being—and the course will help them track their progress along the way. The course will include: Short videos featuring the co-instructors and guest lectures from top experts on the science of happiness; Articles and other readings that make the science accessible and understandable to non-academics; Weekly “happiness practices”—real-world exercises that students can try on their own, all based on research linking these practices to greater happiness; Tests, quizzes, polls, and a weekly “emotion check-in” that help students gauge their happiness and track their progress over time; The course will be led by two celebrated teachers from the Greater Good Science Center: Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., the GGSC’s science director, and GGSC founder Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., who is a psychology professor at UC Berkeley and author of the best-selling book Born to Be Good. It will also feature guest presentations by some of the world’s leading authorities on positive psychology, including Sonja Lyubomirsky, Barbara Fredrickson, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. “The Science of Happiness” is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), hosted on the edX platform.
