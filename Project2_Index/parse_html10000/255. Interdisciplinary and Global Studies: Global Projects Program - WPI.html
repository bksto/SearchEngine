At sites as close as our home city of Worcester and at 38 other locations in 25 countries, WPI students collaborate with faculty advisors and sponsor organizations to identify and solve pressing problems impacting communities around the world. Opportunities are available to complete any of the projects required for graduation: IQP, MQP, or HUA at one our off-campus Project Centers. The selection process is competitive and takes place in the fall of each academic year. WPI Global Projects Program participants report that completing a project off campus helped them to view issues from different perspectives and expanded their understanding of global issues, people of other racial and ethnic backgrounds and increased their respect and understanding for cultures outside their own. Our alumni also report that participation in WPI’s GPP improved their presentation and writing skills, enhanced their ability to achieve work/life balance, helped them to develop a stronger personal character, and improved their lives in ways that were not necessarily academic or work-related.
