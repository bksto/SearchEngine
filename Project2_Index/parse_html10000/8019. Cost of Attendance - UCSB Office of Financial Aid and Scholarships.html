Your Financial Aid cost of attendance (or "cost budget") is an estimation of the expenses you will incur as a student while attending the University of California, Santa Barbara*. Some of the figures used in the cost of attendance are averages derived from the Cost Of Attendance Survey (COAS) administered by the University of California, Office of the President, and updated annually for inflation. Some of these figures are fixed (such as student fees, non-resident tuition, and on-campus room and board). The cost of attendance is used to determine the maximum amount of Financial Aid in your award letter. Actual tuition, fees, and charges are subject to change by the Regents of the University of California and could be affected by increases or reductions in State funding, or other developments.
