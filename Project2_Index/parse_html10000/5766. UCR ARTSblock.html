ARTSblock is composed of the California Museum of Photography, the Sweeney Art Gallery, and the Barbara and Art Culver Center of the Arts. Located on a single block in adjacent historical buildings in downtown Riverside, easily accessible to the public as well as the campus, ARTSblock's mission is to provide a cultural presence, educational resource, community center and intellectual meeting ground for the university and the community. ARTSblock's programs investigate the art of our time, media arts, and the history and practice of photography through exhibitions, performances, screenings, workshops, artist residencies, permanent collections, and creative laboratories. ARTSblock presents significant national and international art and photography, and showcases UCR student artwork and regional artists. ARTSblock's activities embody University of California, Riverside's commitment to broadly-based public education and cutting-edge research. ARTSblock offers innovative programs that engage diverse audiences, nourish the imagination and challenge assumptions.
