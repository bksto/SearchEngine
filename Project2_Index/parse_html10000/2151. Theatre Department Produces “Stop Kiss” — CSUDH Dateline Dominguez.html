They find that they are attracted to one another first as friends and then as something deeper. Their first kiss provokes a violent hate crime attack; the ensuing events change their lives and redefine their relationship. “‘Stop Kiss’ is a beautiful and funny play about falling in love,” said theatre department lecturer Kelly Herman, who is directing the CSUDH production. “This play has interwoven in it the joy of new love with the complexities of people’s prejudices and fear, of themselves and of others. It explores commitment, friendship and human compassion. Love is unexpected and to be treasured whenever and with whomever; it is a gift.” Originally staged off-Broadway in 1998 to critical acclaim, “Stop Kiss” was hailed by Charles Isherwood of Variety as “a poignant, funny play about the ways both sudden and slow that lives can change irrevocably,” and by the New York Times as “irresistibly exciting… a sweet, sad and enchantingly sincere play.” Following the March 1 and March 6 performances, the director and cast will host a talkback discussion of the play with members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and ally (LGBTQA) community. “Stop Kiss” will be performed in the intimate 70-seat Edison Studio Theatre, part of the University Theatre Complex. Tickets are $15 for general admission and $12 for students and seniors. Group rates are available. For more ticket information or to purchase tickets online, visit: csudh.edu/theatre/tickets.htm.
