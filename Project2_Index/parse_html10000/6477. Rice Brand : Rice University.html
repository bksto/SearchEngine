But that comparative smallness also makes presenting a clear identity to the world especially important. We amplify our voice when speaking as one interconnected university. By presenting a clear, coordinated identity, we give Rice a face that more people can recognize and value.  The identity standards detailed in this manual provide a visual language that reflects the university as a whole, while still preserving the individuality of our many parts. It is designed to answer your questions about logos, color, typography and more. Please keep it handy and apply these standards consistently.  Our wordmark, logo, seal and mascot connect Rice's noble and notable past with our Vision for the Second Century. They embody the unconventional wisdom we pursue and apply every day in our education, research and public service. Thank you for bearing them proudly.   Sincerely, David W. Leebron, President   Rice University Official Logos      Logo The Rice logo consists of the Rice shield and the Rice primary wordmark. While our wordmark has both a primary and secondary version, only the Rice primary wordmark can be used alongside the Rice shield. Do not change the Rice logo or wordmark in any way. Use only the official Rice logo.     Logo clear space Whenever you use the logo, it should be surrounded with clear space to ensure its visibility and impact. No graphic elements of any kind should invade this zone. Clear space is developed from the height of the owl in the logo and is listed as "x."     Logo minimum size The height of the logo should not be less than one-half inch in any application, shown here in actual size. (A minimum height of 36 pixels.)               6100 Main St., Houston, TX 77005-1827 Mailing Address: P.O.
