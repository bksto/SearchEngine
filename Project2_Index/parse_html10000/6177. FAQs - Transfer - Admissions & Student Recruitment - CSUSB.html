What are the admission requirements for transfer students? The minimum admission requirements for transfer students applying to CSUSB are 60 semester (90 quarter) units of transferable course work taken at a regionally accredited* community college or university. Within the 60 semester (90 quarter) units, students must complete the following four basic skills courses with a grade of "C" or better in each course: Freshman Composition College Algebra (or baccalaureate level transferable math course equivalent) Critical Thinking Speech/Oral Communication The remaining courses for transfer come from the CSU/IGETC General Education Transfer Pattern (at least 30 semester/45 quarter units), and the remaining courses come from the major). Generally, baccalaureate-level courses from accredited institutions transfer. A complete list of transferable courses from the California community colleges to CSUSB may be found at ASSIST. Because CSUSB is an impacted campus, there are additional requirements for transfer students applying to specific majors. *Regional accreditation includes: Western Association of Schools and Colleges Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges North Central Association of Schools and Colleges New England Association of Schools and Colleges Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges Southern Association of Schools and Colleges top What does CSUB consider its local area? Beginning in fall 2010, CSUSB defined its local area to include community colleges within San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. Local Area Community Colleges within San Bernardino County include: Barstow College Chaffey College Copper Mountain College Crafton Hills College San Bernardino Valley College Victor Valley College Local Area Community Colleges within Riverside County include: College of the Desert Mt. San Jacinto College Palo Verde College Riverside Community College top Are there any impacted majors at CSUSB? An impacted major is one where more applications are received from eligible students during the initial filing period than the campus can enroll. There are four majors at CSUSB where admission requirements for the major are set higher than other majors at CSUSB. These majors are Criminal Justice, Kinesiology: Allied Health Professions (formerly Pre-Physical Therapy) , Nursing, and Social Work. Applicants to Nursing and Social Work will be required to complete a supplemental application in order to be fully admitted into the major. California residents are the only students who will be accepted into the Nursing major. top What are the deadlines for admission? Each campus in the CSU system has its own deadlines. The deadlines to attend CSUSB for Fall 2014 include: Submit your application on CSUMentor November 30 Pay the $55 Application Fee February 1 Submit 7th Semester Transcript February 15 Submit final transcripts and other documents required for your application July 1 Mail any supporting documents for your application to: CSUSB Admissions & Student Recruitment 5500 University Parkway San Bernardino, CA 92407 The following deadlines are your next steps to registering: Pay the $100 Confirmation Deposit May 1 Accept your offer of Admission May 1 Sign up for SOAR July 15 Additional deadlines include: Submit your Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) March 2 Apply to EOP March 2 Apply for Housing March top What happens if I miss a deadline for admissions or next steps to registering? CSUSB is an impacted campus, receiving more applications from CSU qualified students than we can enroll. Missing a deadline, even by one day, for any reason, could result in you being blocked from registering in courses for the quarter you applied to. If you were already registered in courses for the quarter you applied to, missing a deadline could result in your being dropped from courses and not being allowed to enroll in the quarter again. If you are not able to attend the quarter you applied to and still wish to attend CSUSB, you would need to apply again to a later, available quarter. top How do I apply? You may submit an application online at CSUMentor. All applicants must pay a non-refundable, non-transferable processing fee of $55 for every CSU application submitted unless qualified for a fee waiver. Qualified students may apply for a need based fee waiver that may be used for up to four campuses. The CSU undergraduate application does not require you to write an essay or submit any letters of recommendation. Students applying to our Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) will need to complete a supplemental application and additional information is necessary. Students applying to an impacted major may have to submit additional information for full admission to the major. top After I submit my online application, when will I hear from CSUSB? If you have a confirmation number from CSUMentor, you should hear from Cal State San Bernardino within approximately two weeks. If you have not received any acknowledgement of your application after that time, please contact us by phone at (909) 537-5188 or by e-mail at moreinfo@csusb.edu. top Where can I find out about Financial Aid and Scholarship opportunities? All government grants, scholarships and loan applications for financial aid are available at FAFSA. Free federal assistance is available to all students who demonstrate financial need. Cal Grant money will help qualifying state residents. Scholarships are available to students who meet their application requirements. Aid is also available to help students and their parents pay for any college expenses through loans.
