Tours are conducted by the UAM Docents, who provide a variety of meaningful experiences to accommodate the diverse needs of our visitors. SCULPTURE TOUR The CSULB Monumental Sculpture Collection is situated throughout the 320-acre beautiful, tree-shaded campus. A complete walking tour of the sculpture collection can be made independently or with the help of a UAM Docent. A walking tour will cover approximately two miles of pleasantly landscaped pathways with an elevation change of 70 feet. Allow at least one hour for tour. A virtual sculpture tour is available on the Collections Sculpture page. If you would like to stop to eat, we recommend bringing a picnic lunch, but food services are available on campus.
