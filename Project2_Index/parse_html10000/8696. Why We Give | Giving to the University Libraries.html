For over 20 years, Laura and Arch have demonstrated tremendous generosity and commitment to a broad range of local non-profits. The call of duty came when they learned that the UA Libraries was spearheading an Online Project for studying art history, so they decided to start an endowment. The library is essential to every student’s success at the University and we feel that it still needs support.    Kate Willock Kate’s decision to invest in the Libraries was a natural extension of her deep appreciation for the work, and value, of the Libraries. What advice would Kate share with those who are thinking about donating to the University Libraries? “Give now,” said Kate, “not when you are gone.

Jance Judy Jance has been a friend of libraries all her life – from her tiny public library in Bisbee, studying in the UA Old Main library and the children’s book collection in the UA College of Education, to her affiliation with the Friends of the University Libraries – Jance has always believed that libraries “are windows on the past and doorways to the future.” Academic libraries, in particular, have a special significance. According to Jance, the University Libraries offer an introspective quality: “They are there to go beyond what’s offered in the classroom. They open the door to self-study.” ©2014 Arizona Board of Regents for The University of Arizona
