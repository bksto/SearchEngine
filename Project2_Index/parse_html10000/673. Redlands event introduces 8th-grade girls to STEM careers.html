(Eric Reed/For the Facts) REDLANDS >> “Stupid shoulders! Can we just cut them off?” A frustrated Clare Groninger puzzled over how to accomplish the difficult T-shirt trick, in which people try to remove a T-shirt from an individual, turn it inside out and put it back on, all while the person’s hands are clasped. It took several minutes before Clare, a 14-year-old from the Competitive Edge Charter Academy in Yucaipa, Lauren Hudspeth, a 14-year-old from the Packinghouse Christian Academy in Redlands, and RubyJean Granillo Molina, a 13-year-old from Competitive Edge, threw in the towel. The activity was part of a Math is Fun workshop Wednesday at the University of Redlands’ Orton Center, part of the 21st annual Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, or STEM, Conference, hosted by the Redlands Branch of the American Association of University Women. Around 600 students from Redlands Unified and neighboring school districts were bused to the university for the day-long activity that introduces eighth-grade girls to careers in the four subjects. Workshops were hosted by professionals in a number of fields such as animal observation and landscape architecture. For Clare, Lauren and RubyJean, the T-shirt activity gave them a look at how math is used in everyday tasks, even if we don’t realize it. “That was harder than I thought,” said Clare with a nervous laugh. “This is pretty much my life right now — trying to get T-shirts off our bodies. It’s here, so you know it was going to be a challenge.” The three girls said they learned about the conference from school administrators and signed up. It was the perfect chance for each to look into possible career choices, they said. For example, Clare wants to be an electrical engineer like her grandfather, and RubyJean wants to be a veterinarian. “It’s really cool because you get to do this with other girls and explore a field that is mostly dominated by men,” Clare said. RubyJean and Lauren nodded in agreement before moving on to another activity. Encouraging girls to look at the STEM fields in a new light is exactly what organizers of the annual event aim to do. Speakers bring their expertise and provide answers to some of the girls’ questions such as: What kind of math do you need to take to become what you do? How long were you in school for this? And how much money do you make?

Goal 2 is: We want them to take more math and science because they are the bookends for STEM.” More than 40 Southern California women donated their time to lead workshops, in addition to dozens of volunteers, the co-chairs said.
