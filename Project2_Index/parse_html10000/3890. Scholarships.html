Selection is based on a thorough review of the admissions application, including, but not limited to test scores and grades. To be eligible for the Regents Scholarship, you must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, or a non-citizen student qualifying under California Assembly Bills 130 or 131, or an international student with outstanding academic qualifications. Only students who fall under these categories are eligible for the Regents Scholarship. All freshmen admitted for the fall quarter at UCSB are considered for the Regents Scholarship, based on their UC Application for Admission. No additional information is required. UCSB typically offers the scholarship to students within the top two percent of admitted freshmen. Students are notified by U.S. Mail in early March if they have been selected. Decisions of the Regents Scholarship Committee are final. Appeals are not accepted. Maintaining Scholarship Eligibility To remain eligible for their scholarship, Regents Scholars are required to maintain both a quarterly and cumulative GPA of 3.20. Should the cumulative GPA drop below 3.20, students are normally allowed two quarters to raise their GPA above 3.20 if it is the first occurrence. Similarly, should the quarterly GPA fall below 3.20, students are typically allowed one quarter to raise their quarterly GPA above 3.20. Exceptional situations will be reviewed by a faculty committee. In cases of marked improvement, students may be given, at the discretion of a faculty review committee, an additional quarter to make up any deficits. Students who lose their scholarship may petition to have it reinstated.
