Cal State Fullerton alumni understand the importance of keeping in touch with fellow Titans on a personal and professional basis. The chapter program serves as an avenue for alumni to continue their connections with the university through the Cal State Fullerton Alumni Association. Chapters of the association fall into several categories including: college & department-based, affinity-based and regional-based.   Members of the Association are encouraged to join one or several of our networking chapters to connect you with Titans who have similar interests.   When signing up or renewing your Alumni Association membership, you can opt in at no extra charge to become a member of one or more chapters. With your membership in a chapter you are kept up to date on all the latest news and are also invited to attend chapter meetings and events. These opportunities provide access to networking within specific industries and access to your fellow Titan alumni, staff and faculty on campus. Sign up today and show your Titan Pride!
