Studies Show WPI Students Are ‘Wicked Smaht’ Luminosity, an online brain training and neuroscience research company, cited WPI in its top 20 smartest American colleges. The study included more than 60,000 students at 411 institutions, and focused on cognitive performance in five areas: speed, attention, flexibility, memory, and problem solving.

WPI is also in the "Great Schools at Great Prices" list, and our senior capstone and internships programs were pronounced exceptional. The review noted that our acceptance rate is down 2 points, which means we’re more selective in accepting freshmen. That’s reflected in the rise, from 63 percent to 65 percent in the past year, of entering freshmen in the top 10 percent of their graduating class. What Fiske Says about WPI (A Lot!) The Fiske Guide to Colleges 2013 edition calls WPI one of the best and most interesting colleges in the country, noting that WPI “emphasizes teamwork instead of competition” and offers a “global emphasis unusual for an engineering school.” In earlier years, Fiske also had great things to say about our programs and the way WPI is creating new approaches to technical education. Read more… Praise from The Princeton Review on a Mix of WPI Features WPI is one of about 15 percent of U.S. colleges profiled in the 2013 edition of “The Best 377 Colleges,” the Review’s flagship college guide. Interviews showed that students enjoy our diverse, project-based system and our academic mix. The 2013 “Best 296 Business Schools” praised WPI’s School of Business as meeting the needs of “Graduate-level Biz-savvy Technophiles.” In 2012, we were 17th nationally in career services, with practical studies “helpful for future career plans.” With LEED buildings, WPI led the green list in Worcester last year and was 12th among 1,000 colleges in the international Great Power Race.

Leading Education for Women in STEM Fields Women looking for a strong STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education find it at WPI, where, according to BestCollegesOnline.com, we’re moving fast to the top of the list with “outstanding female students and faculty.” In addition to providing support for women on campus, WPI offers programs to encourage girls and teens interested in STEM subjects and careers. Home to ‘Happiest’ Students All these accolades, and students at WPI are still some of the happiest in the country, as they were according to The Princeton Review’s 2010 “Best Colleges” report, which ranked us in the top 20 of national colleges and universities where students feel the "happiest." ‘Innovative’ per New England Association of Schools and Colleges In its latest accreditation letter, NEASC (New England Association of Schools and Colleges) said of WPI: "We warmly commend the Institute for…its innovative and effective approach to technological education that integrates theory and practice and that is ably supported by a highly qualified, fully committed faculty.…Worcester Polytechnic Institute is 'one of the nation's truly fine technological universities'.” (05/06/02) NEASC’s spring 2012 report has not yet been released, but, as the Institute leads in vital fields, we expect more very positive statements about our efforts.   About WPI Visit WPI Interactive Tour WPI Difference Facts & Figures History & Traditions Awards & Accolades Awards Presented by WPI Faculty Awards Recognition for WPI Student Awards Mission & Goals Sustainability Accreditation for WPI & Programs Desktop Wallpaper Send a WPI E-Card WPI Website Related Sites Office of the President Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
