Innovation is an increasingly important factor in the growth of world economies. It is especially important in key economic sectors like manufacturing, materials, energy, biotechnology, healthcare, networks, and professional and business services. The advances in and applications of the mathematical sciences have become drivers of innovation as new systems and methodologies have become more complex. As mathematics drives innovation, it also drives careers. Students are an obvious group that is interested in opportunities for meaningful and challenging careers.  We are proud of our alumni, Jonathan Adler (WPI 2007, 2009), and Rebecca Wasyk (WPI PhD 2008, WPI REU 2000), whose successful careers have been highlighted this year.  Read more about them at:  http://www.mathaware.org/mam/2015/highlighted/.  Each year the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics (JPBM) sponsors Mathematics Awareness Month to recognize the importance of mathematics through written materials and an accompanying poster that highlight mathematical developments and applications in one particular area.  At www.mathaware.org, you can find activities, related resources, and how to order the theme poster. Mathematics Awareness Month, held each year in April, was created to increase public understanding of and appreciation for mathematics. It began in 1986, when President Reagan issued a proclamation establishing National Mathematics Awareness Week. Activities for Mathematics Awareness Month generally are organized on local, state and regional levels by college and university departments, institutional public information offices, student groups, and related associations and interest groups. The JPBM is a collaborative effort of the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the American Statistical Association (ASA), the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM).
