We’re glad you've decided to join us in our mission of advancing the science and practice of decision making. Our history tells the story of tradition, innovation and education, but also with learning and evolution come change. There are a lot of exciting changes happening at DSI. We’re launching this new website that will serve as a portal for our members, students, fellows, sponsors, volunteers, etc. The new site has been designed with the future in mind and plans have been set to provide regional members with access to their specific web portal, where you’ll be able to share and receive information about your experiences/areas of interest.  To better utilize the tapestry of changing environments faced by organizations, DSI has broadened it topological interests. Through DSI’s journals and annual meeting we offer education, research and training in multi-discipline approaches that advance decision making research with application to all the functional areas of business and beyond. We look forward to your participation and future contributions to the Decision Sciences.
