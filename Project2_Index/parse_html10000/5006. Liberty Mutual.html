Final average pay under the Liberty Mutual retirement plans is equal to the average of a named individual’s eligible compensation for the highest five consecutive calendar years during the last ten calendar years of employment.   Pay increases or decreases after December 31, 2013 are taken into account in determining the final average pay benefit.  Only base salary and short-term incentive compensation are considered eligible compensation for purposes of the final average pay formula.   Effective as of January 1, 2014, a cash balance benefit formula also applies.  Under this formula, each participant in the retirement plans will have a notional cash balance account which will be credited with pay credits equal to 4.5 percent per annum of eligible compensation and interest credits based on the 30-Year US Treasury rate for the August immediately preceding a plan year.  Compensation taken into account under the final average pay and cash balance formula is the same.  The total benefit due under the retirement plans is the sum of the amount due under the final average pay formula and the cash balance formula.   The Company also sponsors a Section 401(k) plan covering substantially all of the Company’s employees (the “LM 401(k) Plan”) that allows them to set aside eligible pay, subject to a Company match, on a tax advantaged basis.  The Non-Qualified Plan also allows participants to elect to set aside eligible pay that is not otherwise allowed for under the Company’s 401(k) Plan due to tax law limits for payment at a fixed future date or beginning at retirement.  Certain amounts set aside for savings under the Non-Qualified Plan are also matched by the Company under the same match formula that applies to employees generally under the LM 401(k) Plan.  Under both the LM 401(k) Plan and the Non-Qualified Plan, amounts set aside by a participant and the matching contributions, are invested in one or more investment options elected by the participants and their account balances are adjusted accordingly for their respective investment gains or losses.     (2)    See table entitled “AUs Exercised and RUs Redeemed in 2014” for additional compensation paid to the named executive officers in 2014.  This table sets forth the specific cash proceeds received in 2014 by the named executive officers from AUs exercised and RUs redeemed from grants previously awarded and vested as of April 1, 2014.  AUs are granted with a 10 year term.  AUs can be exercised when vested at the personal discretion and timing of the named executive officer, but within a redemption window, which is in the second quarter of the calendar year.  Redemption decisions concerning RUs must be made by the named executive officer prior to the grant and redemption is deferred to either (a) a fixed date beyond the vesting period or (b) upon retirement.  See footnotes (3) and (4) for additional information concerning AUs and RUs.   (3)    The named executive officers were awarded certain amounts of appreciation units (“AUs”) under the Liberty Mutual Executive Partnership Plan (“EPP”) in 2014.  Each AU is a bookkeeping entry that entitles the holder to a payment of cash at a later time. An AU has no immediate cash value. Instead, the named executive officer may only become entitled to a later cash payment to the extent that there is an increase in the unit value after the grant date. The increase or decrease in unit value after the grant date is measured based on the change in the Company’s book value.  The reported amounts reflect the target AU compensation at the grant date. The target AU compensation is determined based upon reference to market data for executives with similar responsibilities and with companies of similar size and complexity to the Company provided by an independent consultant engaged by the compensation committee of the board.  There can be no assurance that the target AU compensation will actually be delivered as the actual amount realized will vary based upon the performance of the Company and the time period the AUs are held prior to exercise. AUs generally vest over a 4 year period in annual increments of 25%.    See footnote (2) for additional information concerning AUs.   (4)    The named executive officers were awarded certain amounts of restricted units (“RUs”) under the Liberty Mutual Executive Partnership Deferred Compensation Plan (“EPDCP”) in 2014.  Each RU is a bookkeeping entry that entitles the holder to a payment of cash at a later time. The value of each RU is based on the Company’s book value.  The reported amounts reflect the target RU compensation at the grant date. The target RU compensation is determined based upon reference to market data for executives with similar responsibilities and with companies of similar size and complexity to the Company provided by an independent consultant engaged by the compensation committee of the board.  There can be no assurance that the target RU compensation will actually be delivered as the actual amount realized will vary based upon the performance of the Company and the time period the RUs are held prior to redemption. RUs generally vest over a 4 year period in annual increments of 25%.  See footnote (2) for additional information concerning RUs.    (5)    Non-executive directors receive an annual retainer, payable on a quarterly basis.  Non-executive board members also received annual retainers, payable on a quarterly basis, if applicable, (a) for serving as a member of separate committees of the board, (b) for serving as a chairman of such committees, or (c) for serving as lead director.  Non-executive directors receive additional items including (a) certain medical, dental and business travel benefits, the economic value of which is included in the above disclosure table, and (b) subject to satisfaction of specific terms and conditions, deferred compensation in the form of RUs limited in time and scope pursuant to the Liberty Mutual Director Partnership Deferred Compensation Plan that are redeemable only subsequent to termination of their board service and (c) matching contributions to charitable organizations up to $7,500 per year.       ©2015 Liberty Mutual Insurance, 175 Berkeley St., Boston, MA 02116
