The Wildcats are also trying not to come up short like the others did in their quest to duplicate the Hoosiers’ perfect championship campaign. The Wildcats knocked off Florida 67-50 Saturday in a Southeastern Conference matchup and Kentucky wrapped up the season 31-0, 18-0 in the SEC. “We all knew that we would make some noise and do...

Graves The Associated Press |1 hr ago MLB baseball Evan Longoria eyes ‘bounce-back’ year after Rays offseason makeover PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. — Evan Longoria trusts the Tampa Bay Rays to get it right, so he has no complaints about the club’s winter makeover. Not that the star third baseman was happy to see the franchise lose manager Joe Maddon and front office executive Andrew Friedman within a 10-day span of October, then watch their successors spend much of the next three months revamping the roster through a series of trades and free agent signings that have filled the clubhouse with new... By FRED GOODALL The Associated Press |1 week ago Men's college basketball Pac-12 has several men’s basketball teams on NCAA bubble The Pac-12’s NCAA tournament bubble is beginning to pulsate. No. 7 Arizona and No. 13 Utah are virtual locks to make the bracket, at this point fighting for higher seeds. After that, the Pac-12 has three teams that could have a good shot with a strong finish and two others that will really need to make some noise at the end of the season. Once on the outside looking in, Oregon (21-8) put itself squarely inside the bubble with its massive home win over Utah last...

Washington had lost its last month, after dismissing Robert Upshaw for a violation of team rules. Regarded as a potential first-round draft pick, the 7-foot center had averaged 10.9 points, 8.2 rebounds, and a nation-leading 4.4 blocks. Since then, the... Jack Wang |1 week, 3 days ago UCLA UCLA still trying to find defensive consistency in final stretch UCLA entered the Wells Fargo Arena last Wednesday and left with a loss. Three days later, 110 miles away, it popped in and out of the McKale Center with the same result. Another Pac-12 road trip, another squandered chance to solidify a still questionable NCAA Tournament resume. But it’s the way that the Bruins lost each game ‑ 68-66 at Arizona State and 57-47 at No. 7 Arizona ‑ that illustrates a blueprint for them as they enter the season’s final... Jack Wang |1 week, 4 days ago USC Can Andy Enfield turn USC basketball into winners next season? When USC’s basketball team snapped its nine-game losing streak with a victory over Oregon State earlier this month, Coach Andy Enfield was asked what the victory meant for him. “Forget about me,” Enfield said. “I’ll be fine.” That is probably true. Despite a 4-29 record in the Pacific-12 Conference over the past two years, USC athletic director Pat Haden said he has “patience” and remains confident Enfield will turn USC into... Scott Wolf |1 week, 4 days ago UCLA UCLA hires Tom Bradley as defensive coordinator UCLA has hired its third defensive coordinator in three years, picking up former longtime Penn State assistant Tom Bradley. Numerous reports last week had first pinned Bradley as the leading candidate to fill the Bruins’ open staff position, which was vacated earlier this when Jeff Ulbrich accepted an offer to become the Atlanta Falcons’ linebackers coach.

Florida State defensive lineman Mario Williams Jr. was almost as good. On the third day of workouts at the annual NFL scouting combine, Beasley pulled off an impressive double posting the fastest 40-yard dash time of the day at 4.53 seconds and sharing the title of most bench press reps at 225 pounds with 35. Beasley did that despite...
