A SPA is a CalNet ID that can be shared by multiple users for collaborative purposes. Rather than the shared passwords that you used with departmental accounts, you authenticate your SPA using the passphrase associated with your personal CalNet ID. What does this mean for departmental account owners? If you use a bConnected key to access a departmental account via a third-party client (such as Mac OS X Mail or Microsoft Outlook): your access will NOT change.** If you log in using the web interface of bMail/bCal/bDrive: you will use a SPA instead of the bConnected Key on a Google-branded login screen. (See below for the SPA naming convention) If you have delegated access to a departmental account in bMail: you'll still be able to send mail as that departmental account from within your personal bMail account. (These are the messages that show up as "sent by".) That access will NOT change. **The bConnected Administrators recommend delegating account access -- rather than giving out the access key -- to enable others to see email and use the departmental account. Delegation may be set up only by the account owner, and only to other @berkeley.edu addresses -- print this pdf for instructions for initial login and account delegation, or see this KnowledgeBase article. HINT: The account owner can avoid a separate account login by delegating access to him/herself -- read more. How to log into CAS with a SPA Basic instructions for logging into your SPA Alternate ways to log into your SPA SPAs + Box = Easy Collaboration SPAs make using BOX easier for collaborating! Items placed by any user inside a folder created by a departmental Box account will be owned by the departmental account and will be counted against the department account’s quota, not the individual users’ quota. This also allows easier management and retention of files as people join and leave a group. To learn more about SPAs and BOX, read Using CalNet Special Purpose Accounts (SPAs) for Departmental/Group storage in Box. SPA Benefits Special Purpose Accounts make collaborating easier! Users who directly log into a bConnected departmental account can view all the account settings (users using delegation only see a partial list of account settings). When users who are directly logged in reply to a message, the From line will no longer have the phrase  <By way of {name}> SPAs offer enhanced security You can create a departmental Box account. The Spa Naming Convention The name of your new SPA will have the prefix "spa-" followed by your departmental account name: spa-departmental account name If your e-mail only uses "@berkeley.edu", your email address will be the suffix portion of your SPA: departmental account name@berkeley.edu For example: If your departmental bConnected account name is "econhelp": SPA: spa-econhelp Email Address: econhelp@berkeley.edu If you have an email subdomain, your email address will be: departmental accountname-subdomain@berkeley.edu For example: If your departmental bConnected account name is "econhelp" and you use a subdomain called “econ.berkeley.edu”: SPA: spa-econhelp Email Address: econhelp-econ@berkeley.edu **Please note: we will require a single SPA ID for a single "@berkeley.edu" domain account and a single SPA ID for a subdomain account Resources Basic instructions on logging in using your SPA Alternate ways to log into your SPA, and more technical information CalNet SPA FAQs For questions and concerns, please contact the bConnected Team For SPA requests and changes, please contact CalNet SPA Support.
