Graduate Education at UC Davis Graduate Studies at UC Davis includes 90 dynamic degree programs and a diverse and interactive student body from around the world. Known for our state-of-the-art research facilities, productive laboratories and progressive spirit – UC Davis offers collaborative and interdisciplinary curricula through graduate groups and designated emphasis options – bringing students and faculty of different academic disciplines together to address real-world challenges. UC Davis master’s and doctoral graduates become leaders in their fields – researchers, teachers, politicians, mentors and entrepreneurs. Graduates go on to guide, define and impact change within our global community. Campus and Student Life The UC Davis main campus is located in Davis, Calf., with studies also occurring in nearby Sacramento, Calif. We are known for our outstanding and high-ranking programs in ecology, biology, engineering and agricultural sciences. Our programs in the social sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and the arts and humanities are also popular and highly prestigious. UC Davis has over 30,000 students, of whom over 8,000 are in graduate and professional school programs. UC Davis faculty and graduate programs attract highly qualified U.S. and international students from diverse educational, social, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. It is this global mix that contributes to the rich character that is UC Davis. The Davis campus is 5,300 acres – the largest of any UC campus – and includes hundreds of beautiful shade trees, wildlife and an arboretum on the banks of Putah Creek, running through the campus. Architecturally, the campus has a wonderful mix of the century-old wooden buildings remaining from the University Farm days, the modern and sleak glass fronted buildings and traditional brick and concrete facilities. The campus core is closed to vehicular traffic as walking, skateboarding and the bicycle are the preferred mode of transportation. The city of Davis is the quintessential college town. Davis is safe, environmentally friendly and children of graduate students attend one of the best school districts in California. The location is ideal – the campus is next door to the diverse metropolitan state capitol of Sacramento, as well as being close to the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains, Lake Tahoe, the Napa Valley wine country and the San Francisco Bay Area. The campus offers limitless recreational opportunities, including a state-of-the-art recreational facility, performing arts center, miles of bicycle trails, an arts and crafts center, and much more. Jeffery C. Gibeling Vice Provost - Graduate Education and Dean - Graduate Studies Jeffery C. Gibeling has been Dean of Graduate Studies since August 2002. A 25-year local resident, Gibeling holds a faculty appointment in the chemical engineering and materials science department, where he still runs his lab. When asked about the path that led him to Graduate Studies, he says it all started when he checked the "Graduate Council" box on the annual call for volunteers from the Academic Senate Committee on Committees more than a decade ago. He spent nearly five years on the Graduate Council, including over one year as its chair. He then served as executive associate dean of Graduate Studies. During that period, when a former dean of Graduate Studies left to become a chancellor of another campus, he served as "de facto" dean and had substantial responsibility for the daily business of Graduate Studies. He has also served as chair of the Academic Senate, which oversees all aspects of academic life at UC Davis, and of which the Graduate Council is a standing committee. "While all of these experiences are important," says Gibeling, "What’s more important is that they reflect my abiding commitment to the importance of graduate education at UC Davis." The University System The University of California has 10 campuses throughout the state – Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz – each with its own distinctive character and setting. All are recognized nationally and internationally as among the largest and most distinguished centers of higher learning and research in the world.
