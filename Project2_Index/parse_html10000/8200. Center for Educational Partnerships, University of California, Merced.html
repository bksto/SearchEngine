The Center for Educational Partnerships was established to contribute to long-range improvement in the education of San Joaquin Valley students and ultimately, to increase the number of area students eligible to attend institutions of higher education. Using the recommendations proposed in the University of California’s Strategic Review Panel on UC Educational Outreach as a guide, the Center for Educational Partnerships’ success comes primarily from its ability to provide student, school and parent-centered services that strive to connect K-12 goals with the University’s efforts to ensure a qualified and diverse student body. Since its establishment, the Center for Educational Partnerships has served more than 24,000 middle and high school students. Of those, more than 10,000 students have been served through grant-funded programs while more than 14,000 have been served by staff with a variety of college-going activities at partner school sites.       The Next 10 Years Building a University of California campus in the heart of California was driven in large part by the belief that San Joaquin Valley students deserved the opportunity to access all of California’s higher educa- tion opportunities. The establishment of the Center for Educational Partnerships was integral to expanding the University of California’s research capacity by working with school districts to learn how to genuinely partner in ways that increased access for students and families. We referred to our work as “Equity and Access” and adopted a principle that has guided us for the past decade. Today, we live by that principle: to create equal opportunities for all students to graduate from secondary schools with the greatest number of postsecondary choices from the widest array of options. We have been fortunate to partner with schools and districts willing to adopt the same principle. Our goals for the next 10 years are simple: continue to support current partnerships, identify opportunities for new ones, all while continuing to refine our work focused on equity and access. CHANCELLOR'S MESSAGE | Dorothy Leland On opening day in 2005, Chancellor Tomlinson-Keasey fondly described our campus as a “perfect 10.” The term referred to UC Merced’s status as the 10th campus in the UC system. “A perfect 10” seems especially fitting in 2012. In addition to commemorating the 10th anniversary of UC Merced’s founding, this year, we also celebrate the 10th anniversary of UC Merced’s Center for Educational Partnerships (CEP). The Center for Educational Partnerships, based at our Fresno Center, plays a vital role in expanding access to higher education for Valley students by offering programs and services to partner school districts, schools, students and parents. The Center’s primary mission is to ensure all students have an equal opportunity to graduate with the greatest number of postsecondary choices from the widest array of options. Through the hard work of staff members and the generosity and partnership of those who sup- port the CEP’s important work, the path to higher education is more accessible and tangible for so many who previously may have encountered only roadblocks. Kudos to all those involved with the Center for Educational Partnerships on its 10th anniversary. We look forward to many more years of service to Valley students, parents and schools.
