Construction Update The passage of Measure L, a $230 million bond, the Chaffey College Facilities Master Plan started a major construction project. Everyone is excited the changes happening at Chaffey College. What comes along with the excitement of construction also appears a sense of frustration. We ask that you be patient and understand that construction is only temporary, but lasts a lifetime. We will do our best to keep the community informed of road, facility, building closures. For additional information regarding construction projects, please contact the Marketing and Public Relations office at 909/652-6113.
