Every year more than half a million people flock to campus to take in more than a thousand visual, performing and media arts events created by both guest professionals and gifted students. On any given evening, you'll find top-tier student productions:  classic, new and musical theater at the Freud Playhouse, including the work of the TFT Theater Lab, where students perform alongside professionals; dance at the Glorya Kaufman Dance Theater; or a joyful musical explosion at Schoenberg Hall. And throughout the year, the Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA presents contemporary, professional performing arts in every discipline. One night Royce Hall echoes with the poetry of Allen Ginsberg or the comedy of Nick Offerman. The next night, there are performances by Emmylou Harris and Her Red Dirt Boys, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Circus Oz or a compelling restaging of Eugene Ionesco's Rhinoceros. In addition, the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television is closely associated with the nearby Geffen Playhouse, which is acclaimed for its development of new plays.
