Publication awards honor books and papers that make a significant research impact. The book has drawn national attention and contributed much to the larger discussion of the value of higher education, making Hamilton a key influencer on the subject of inequality in education. The ASA will formally recognize Hamilton in August at its annual meeting in Chicago.
