The VIP page is a custom-designed webpage that holds links to admission information, academic departments, messages from department chairs and student services and activities (housing, financial aid and athletics). 'Prospective Students' will answer many of your general questions about majors offered, cost of attendance, campus statistics, selection criteria, test information, residency and campus visits. Be sure to visit our Cal Poly's Virtual Viewbook! Loaded with a virtual tour of the campus and the surrounding area, video interviews and flash animated presentations. This viewbook lets you begin to experience Cal Poly before you set foot on campus. 'How to Apply' will answer specific questions and direct the student to the online application via CSUMentor. It is strongly advised that before beginning the application the student read the instructions thoroughly. Since Cal Poly's motto is "learn by doing," we encourage you to work with your student to ensure he/she has an active role throughout the entire application process.
