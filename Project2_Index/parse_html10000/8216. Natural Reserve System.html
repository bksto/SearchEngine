Examples include journal articles, thesis, books, conference proceedings, film and artwork, etc. All publications have been transferred to Zotero and are managed by the UCNRS information management group and the reserve directors for that reserve. If you wish to can download the Zotero application and access the data for that interface instead of this web interface. You can also enter a new bibliographic entry into this database from this web site soon. Entries will be emailed to the reserve manager and then entered into that reserve's database by the reserve manager. We request if a DOI # is available that you include it with all entries. We also encourage you to add the reserves's DOI# in any publications resulting from research at that reserve.     This bibliography was made possible by the work of the NRS reserve managers and stewards, as well as the numerous people who have helped in the compilation and maintenance of the individual site bibliographies.Â Â  Many thanks to all of them.   The All-Site Bibliography is maintained by the NRS Information Manager.
