Within Biosphere 2 there are two divisions, B2 Earthscience and B2 Institute. B2 Earthscience is utilizing the unique attributes of Biosphere 2 to conduct research that cannot be accomplished anywhere else, by anyone else. B2 Institute is addressing scientific Grand Challenges whose solutions require the combined expertise of a broad range of scientific fields and diverse interdisciplinary talents. Another important component of Biosphere 2 is Education and Outreach. This overlaps both B2 Earthscience and B2 Institute to provide educational experiences and active involvement for students and community members.
