Or put a smile on a patient's face? Or even help save lives? At UCLA, giving back to the health system is easy to do. UCLA accepts a variety of donations, ranging from monetary gifts to memorials and tributes to planned giving. Additionally, we make it easy to donate by accepting gifts online. Interested volunteers can donate their time to our health care system as well — by becoming one of 3,500 monthly volunteers in any of our hospitals, clinics or the School of Medicine. We also accept blood donations at the Blood and Platelet Center, where your single donation can save up to three lives. Whichever way you choose to give back, UCLA makes it simple to do.
