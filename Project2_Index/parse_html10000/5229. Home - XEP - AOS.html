XEP - AOS Home Media People Events Documents Contact We're updating the website! As XEP, we are working to modernize our old website and, in that way, keep people informed about the events that we and the rest of the AOS community are organizing.  We also plan to go social, with a Facebook page to speed up the communication among students in the department.  We hope you can join us! About us... Chi Epsilon Pi (ΧΕΠ) is a graduate student group in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).  We work to support graduate students in our department through organizing academic and social activities, and by representating student interests to the department, university, and student government. ΧΕΠ was founded at UCLA in 1951, and it is now a national meteorological honors society.  Our chapter is effectively a graduate student organization, although membership for undergraduates is permitted.  You can read our constitution for more information.
