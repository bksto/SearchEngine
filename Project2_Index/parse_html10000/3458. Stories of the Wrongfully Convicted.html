Tom Goldstein and Obie Anthony each spent more than 20 years in prison, wrongfully convicted of murder. They will talk about their experience during the 4 p.m. "In Their Own Words: Experiences of the Wrongfully Convicted" in Portola Pavilion B of the Titan Student Union. Other panels with leading experts on the subject of wrongful conviction and the death penalty will take place throughout the day. Stacy L. Mallicoat, professor of criminal justice, deputy chair of the Division of Politics, Administration and Justice and Dean's Fellow for Civic Engagement, says wrongful conviction is one of the most important issues facing our criminal justice system. "This is something that impacts everybody. It can happen to anyone." Mallicoat wanted to bring this event to Cal State Fullerton students, she explained, "to provide that local link — to show that this is happening in their backyard. Regardless of whether they are art or kinesiology majors, we want them to be aware of what is going on around them. "We are bringing experts from around the U.S. — people who are involved not just on a local level, but on a national level," she added. "People who are affecting social change." Other symposium lectures taking place: 1 p.m. — "How the Discovery of Erroneous Convictions Has Affected Contemporary Death Penalty Debates" by Michael L. Radelet, professor of sociology at University of Colorado-Boulder, whose work is credited with introducing the "innocence argument" in such debates. 2:30 p.m. — "Fingerprints and Wrongful Convictions" by Simon Cole, professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine, and co-author of "Truth Machine: The Contentious History of DNA Fingerprinting"; and "The Importance of Investigation in Exposing Wrongful Convictions" by Rosa Greenbaum, Ph.D. candidate in crime, law and society at UC Irvine. 7 p.m. — "Life After Death Row: Exonerees Search for Community and Identity" by Kimberly Cook, professor of sociology and criminology at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington; and Saundra Westervelt, associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.
