After her retirement, Fran continued to impact the lives of exceptional students and to honor members of her own family by making investments in tax-advantaged charitable gifts to UCR. Her Roots A Riverside native, Fran was among the first staff members to join the campus when it opened in 1954. She went on to serve the university for more than 32 years. Her Gift To honor the memory of her father, a mining engineer, Fran contributed assets from an IRA to establish the Alexander Scott Bilderback Endowed Scholarship. In keeping with her dedication to the health sciences, she designated funds from her scholarship to support students pursuing the emerging field of bioengineering — an interdisciplinary program that combines bioscience with engineering applications to develop new advances in medical technology. Her Legacy She seeks to inspire UCR students to imagine new solutions to today's global challenges and to become leaders in 21st century medical research.
