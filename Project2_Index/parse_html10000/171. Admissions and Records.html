Before classes begin, you will have 10 days, including weekends and holidays, to pay your balance due. If payment in full is not received by your payment deadline you will be dropped. Note: If you register less than 10 days prior to the first day of instruction you will not have the full 10 days to pay. All fees will be due prior to the first day of instruction. (See Payment Chart in the Schedule of Classes). Once the term starts, fees are due at the time of registration. If payment is not received, a financial hold will be placed on your account. Your account will remain restricted until payment is received. Are there any exceptions to the 10-Day Drop Process? The following special groups will not be dropped for non-payment: Students who receive the BOG Waiver, either before registering or during the 10-Day Process. Those enrolled in the FACTS Deferred Payment Plan. Students with third-party billing arrangements. International Students, with or without sponsorship. Will my Financial Aid BOG Waiver cover all of my fees? The BOG Waiver does not cover all fees for registration. You must pay the remaining balance by the first day of the semester. If payment is not received, a financial hold will be placed on your student account. Your account will remain restricted until payment is received. Please Note: My ChaffeyVIEW will be unavailable intermittently on Sundays for scheduled system maintenance. If your payment due date falls on a Sunday, we recommend you pay your fees early to avoid losing your classes. PHOTO ID CARD RE-PRINT REQUESTS Photo ID cards are required for use of labs, library, and other services.
