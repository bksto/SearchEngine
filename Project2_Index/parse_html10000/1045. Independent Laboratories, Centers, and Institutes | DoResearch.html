Independent Laboratories, Centers, and Institutes The Independent Laboratories, Centers, and Institutes provide significant support for interdisciplinary research at Stanford. They involve hundreds of faculty members, administrative, research, technical staff, and students at all levels. These units play a critical role in the Stanford mission of creating and sharing knowledge.  Interdisciplinary research centers draw on the strengths of schools and departments across the University. The interdisciplinary research centers are managed by the Vice Provost and Dean of Research, Dr. Ann Arvin.
