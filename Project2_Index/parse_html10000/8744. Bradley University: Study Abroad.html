Study Abroad is a benchmark academic experience that changes students' perspectives and enriches their lives. An educational experience abroad fosters the best kind of intellectual and personal risk-taking. It makes you wiser and more courageous. Sound too grand? Then consider this: because of the increasingly global nature of our economy, students now more than ever experience career-related benefits related to international academic experience. Bradley University is committed to offering students a broad variety of opportunities for international study. During the January and May/June interims, students can travel with other BU students and faculty on a variety of short-term intensive academic programs abroad. And, of course, students can study abroad for a semester or a year, and even use part or all of their Bradley financial aid packages at a number of distinguished universities and programs abroad.

This respect is crucial to the constructive exchange of ideas at the heart of the university experience. There is no tolerance for any form of harassment or other activities that create or support an environment that is sexually offensive or threatening to an employee, student or visitor. Bradley University reaffirms its position that all students, faculty, and staff have a right to be free from all forms of gender- and sex-based discrimination, including acts of sexual violence, sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, and sexually based stalking.   © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
