Staff Dr. Chrysanthe (Chrys) Demetry is Director of the Morgan Teaching and Learning Center and Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering. She received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from WPI (1988) and a Ph.D. in Ceramics at MIT (1993). On the faculty at WPI since 1993, in 2006 she was appointed Director of the Center for Educational Development & Assessment, now the Morgan Center. In her role as Director, Chrys provides individual consultations with faculty and graduate Teaching Assistants, organizes the Food for Thought teaching and learning workshop and seminar series, coordinates TA Training and aspects of New Faculty Orientation, manages the New Faculty Mentoring Program, and provides oversight for several internal grants programs that support innovative teaching and curriculum initiatives and professional development in teaching. Dozens of additional WPI faculty contribute to the delivery of these programs each year. Assessment is woven throughout the Center's programs, with a focus on continuous improvement. Professor Demetry continues teaching materials science and engineering courses in the Mechanical Engineering Department, advises IQPs in the Global Perspective Program, and is an active academic advisor. In addition, she co-directs the interdisciplinary degree program in Professional Writing, and since 1997 has been involved in Camp Reach, WPI's engineering summer program for middle school girls. She also maintains educational research projects and publishes in the areas of course design, educational technology, student learning outcomes in the Global Perspective Program, and K-12 engineering outreach. Engaged in these multiple roles, she understands and considers the pressures that faculty face in meeting their goals for teaching, scholarship, and service.   Academics Morgan Teaching and Learning Center About Us Mission History Resources for New Faculty Resources for All Faculty Resources for TAs & Supervisors News Events Funding Opportunities Contact Morgan Teaching and Learning Center Chrysanthe Demetry, Ph.D., Director Gordon Library, Room 302 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5707 morgan-center@wpi.edu Related Sites Certificate in College Teaching Academic Technology Center (ATC) Center for Communication Across the Curicculum Project Advising Resources Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
