This program is administered by UMass Amherst Information Technologies (UMass Amherst IT) and is available to students, faculty, and staff at all UMass campuses. Microsoft Software for Personal Use (Students, Faculty & Staff) Students, faculty, and staff can purchase discounted software for personal use through GovConnection, a software retailer and distributor. Members of the University community on all UMass campuses can participate. Note: Faculty and staff can purchase one personal copy of Microsoft Office through Microsoft Campus Agreement at a greater discount. Additional copies can be purchased through GovConnection.  Software offered through this program includes Microsoft Office 365 University for Windows & Mac OS X. Microsoft Software for Official Institutional Use (Departments, Faculty & Staff) Departments, faculty or staff from all UMass campuses who wish to purchase Microsoft software for official institutional use can also order through GovConnection.  IMPORTANT! UMass Amherst departments, faculty, and staff can obtain some versions of Windows operating systems, and of the Microsoft Office suite at no additional cost for University-owned computers through Microsoft Campus Agreement. Microsoft DreamSpark (formerly MSDN-AA) also offers free copies of Windows operating systems, developer tools, server operating systems, and other Microsoft software to members of the campus community. Restrictions apply.  Licenses & CDs Licenses and CDs are sold separately. Order one or more licenses if your department already has a CD-ROM containing the software, but you need more license keys to use it legally on additional computers. Order a CD if you do not have the CD for a piece of software and already own, or are purchasing, a software license key.
