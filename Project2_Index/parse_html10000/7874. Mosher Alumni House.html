This is an extremely convenient, easy to find location for returning alumni and other visitors. Because the site is also adjacent to Campbell Hall, UCSB's largest lecture hall, Mosher Alumni House will have high visibility within the student body as they work their way toward becoming alumni themselves. It is a location which provides sweeping views of the Santa Ynez Mountains north of campus and views from rooftop terraces of the Santa Barbara Channel. The Mosher Alumni House is one of the premier event locations on campus. It's perfect for your wedding, conference, or special event. Meeting rooms and reception areas offer spectacular settings and views from the Pacific Ocean to the Santa Ynez Mountains. Mosher Alumni House, on the UC Santa Barbara campus is elegant and unique while comfortable and convenient. Staff offices are located on the 2nd and 3rd floor on the Southwest side of the building. .
