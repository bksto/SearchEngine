Over the past 40 years, UCLA researchers have made historic contributions to our understanding of the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans, teleconnections between weather regimes all over the globe, and the development of techniques to simulate weather and climate. This strong tradition of excellence continues today. Whether it be studying the dynamics of a single giant tornado, the coming and going of El Nino, or the changing climate of the modern era and the next century, weather and climate research at UCLA is distinguished by its focus on the theoretical underpinnings and observational tools necessary to understand all aspects of our atmosphere and oceans. UCLA researchers are world leaders in many areas, including theories of climate and weather dynamics, the development and application of numerical models of the atmosphere and oceans, and techniques to convert remotely-sensed data into useful climate and weather information.   The program is subdivided into the following categories Climate Variability and Change Clouds, Convection, and Turbulence Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Oceans Storms and Severe Weather Tropical Meteorology and Climate Weather and Climate Modeling Weather and Climate Observation Affiliated Faculty Distinguished Research Professor; Emeritus Akio Arakawa Professor Wolfgang Buermann Professor Robert Fovell Distinguished Research Professor Michael Ghil Professor Alex Hall Professor C.
