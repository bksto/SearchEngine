Placing your request 3-4 weeks in advance is recommended, but a minimum of two weeks notice is required. Special arrangements for tours and admissions presentations can often be made at times convenient for the group. All tours are led by current Cal Poly students who sign up to lead group tours as their schedules allow; tour confirmation is made when a student tour guide is scheduled. Allow maximum lead time for the greatest chance of accommodation. Schools/Organizations: To arrange a special group tour for 15 or more people, please email Amy Shore at ashore@calpoly.edu. Families must register for campus tours through online tour registration.
