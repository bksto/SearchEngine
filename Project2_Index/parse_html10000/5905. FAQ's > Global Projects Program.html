Outgoing Exchange: Frequently Asked Questions Questions about the application process or what happens next?  Click here:   Application Process   Application Process   1. I cannot log in to the Global Portal, what do I do? You must start an application before you can log in to this site. Any time that you are trying to log into the Global Portal Website prior to having started an application you will get an error message. To start an application: Choose "Browse Programs".  Then search for the programs that interest you.  When you have chosen the project center that you would like to apply to, you can choose the "Apply Now" button. Please make sure that the project center you apply to is your first choice. Once you have started an application you will thereafter be able to log into the Global Portal Website and your application will become your home page. Your application can be saved at the end of each session and will only be submitted once you mark it as complete. 2. Where is the application and how do I fill it out? To start an application: Choose "Browse Programs".  Then search for the programs that interest you.  When you have chosen the project center that you would like to apply to, you can choose the "Apply Now" button. Please make sure that the project center you apply to is your first choice. Once you have started an application you will thereafter be able to log into the Global Portal Website and your application will become your home page. Your application can be saved at the end of each session and will only be submitted once you mark it as complete. 3. What is required for the application? The online application consists of some biographical data, a resume, an essay, and two references with their contact information.  You will have some forms to submit in person to the IGSD office as part of the application as well.  All of these forms can be found as part of your application. 4. Who can I list as my references? Ideally, both references should be an academic reference from a WPI faculty member. If this is not possible, your second reference can be from the WPI community (a staff member or coach, not a fellow student) or from outside WPI and should be able to speak to your ability to fulfill responsibilities, perform under pressure, meet deadlines, and function in a team. 5. When will my references be contacted? Your references will be contacted if the Center Director who interviews you needs more information to make a decision on your application. They may be contacted by phone or email any time after your application is submitted. 6. What is the difference between the Lille, France Exchange Program and an off-campus IQP Project Center? Unlike an off-campus IQP Project Center, students who participate in the Lille, France Exchange Program work on an eleven week project sponsored by Saint-Gobain from January to April for IQP credit with students and faculty from Haute Etude d’Ingenieurs (HEI) Lille Catholic University. Subsequently, students will work from April to mid-August as interns (paid) at Saint-Gobain in Conflans, France.  Students must be a U.S. citizen (or hold a Green Card) and be fluent (verbal and written) in the French language. Saint-Gobain Corporation will cover the cost of airfare and housing. Students are responsible for WPI costs including tutition. 7. Can I apply to both an Outgoing Exchange Program and an IQP Project Center? Yes! You will have to create two seperate applications as these run on different application cycles. 8. When will I be notified of the decision? You will be interviewed and notified of your acceptance into the exchange program by early November. You must commit to this program before you are notified regarding your IQP application. If you choose to enroll in the Outgoing Exchange program, you will have to withdraw from the IQP application process. Follow us on
