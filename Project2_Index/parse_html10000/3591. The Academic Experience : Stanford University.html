FIND SOLUTIONS With more funding available for undergraduate research than at any other college or university in the nation, Stanford students have every opportunity to engage in high-level research. The Academic Experience Stanford's motto, "the wind of freedom blows," a call to unfettered research, service and discovery, was adopted as a guiding principle more than 100 years ago. Stanford's pioneering spirit of the American West fuels much of its mission, which is to overcome our time's seemingly intractable challenges through open and fearless inquiry and action. Take the time to learn more about how our academic programs and undergraduate research opportunities relate to our mission. These pages will also provide you with basic information about majors and minors as well as the General Education requirements. Academic Programs Stanford offers more than 75 programs of study in three undergraduate schools. Students can pursue joint bachelor/master degree programs and take classes in the graduate schools of education, law, medicine and business. Undergraduate Education Stanford's undergraduate education is distinguished by a unique quarter-system calendar and a virtually unrivaled 5:1 student-to-faculty ratio. At least 2/3 of Stanford classes enroll 19 or fewer students. Beyond the Campus The reach of Stanford's campus extends far beyond Palo Alto—to Monterey Bay (home of the Hopkins Marine Institute), to the Stanford in Washington Program, and to 13 study-abroad programs from Beijing to Berlin. Our Faculty Current Stanford faculty members include 22 Nobel laureates and five Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as 27 MacArthur Fellows. One is the former U.S. Secretary of State while another founded the world's first sleep laboratory.
