You cannot reproduce any Harvard insignia, shield, logos, or other marks without specific permission.  You can’t edit our material, except to reflect relative changes in time, location, and editorial style. (For example, “yesterday” can be changed to “last week,” and “Cambridge, Mass.” can be changed to “Massachusetts” or “here.”) If you’re republishing online, you have to link to the original Gazette story, and include all of the links from our story. You can’t sell our material separately. It’s ok to put our stories on pages with ads, but not ads specifically sold against our stories. You can’t republish our material wholesale, or automatically; you need to select stories to be republished individually. You cannot republish our photographs without specific permission. For photo permissions, please email media@harvard.edu. You can embed Harvard videos and audio from our YouTube and SoundCloud accounts. You have to credit us – ideally in the byline. We prefer “Author Name, Harvard Gazette.” We do not generally permit translation of our stories into another language.
