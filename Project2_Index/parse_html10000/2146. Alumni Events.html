Four panelists made up of beach alums and faculty members with knowledge and experience in this topic will explore what graduate programs are best for you, preparing for entrance exams, financing grad school and much more! Do not miss this free event and opportunity to learn from fellow Beach grads. Alumni Night: Pageant of the Masters Sunday, July 12, 2015 A Southern California tradition, the Pageant of the Masters is ninety minutes of “living pictures” – incredibly faithful art re-creations of classical and contemporary works with real people posing to look exactly like their counterparts in the original pieces. This year’s theme is “The Pursuit of Happiness.” Please note that we are unable to provide refunds on tickets once they have been purchased. If you have any questions about an event, please do not hesitate to call the staff member listed for each event for more information. We enjoy hearing from you!
