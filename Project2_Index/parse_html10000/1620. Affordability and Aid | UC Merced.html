However, the University of California Office of the President and UC Merced agree that if you're ready to attend a UC campus, money shouldn't stand in your way. In 2013-14, data shows that 86 percent of all undergraduate students received some form of financial aid. These awards represent money that does not need to be repaid, and do not include fee waivers or work-study benefits. There are numerous forms of aid out there. The UC's Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan covers systemwide fees for California residents whose families earns less than $80,000 a year and qualify for financial aid. Additionally, Blue and Gold students may qualify for even more gift aid to help reduce the cost of attending. But even when families are above that income threshold, their students still stand a good chance of getting some type of financial assistance at UC Merced, which is committed to making a research-based college education within financial reach of all qualified students. The key to affording UC Merced is knowing the options available. The Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and the University of California websites are rich resources of information for students and their families.     The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
