Ensuring that every single one of them is well cared for is a top priority. From our UC Student Health Insurance Plan and campus pharmacy to our virtual heath & wellness, counseling and disability services, we strive to meet the health-related and personal needs of every student at UCLA. Our Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is recognized as one of the top five hospitals in the country and is consistently ranked the best in the western U.S. — and it's right on our campus. The Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center is rated No. 1 in the nation among university student health facilities. The UCLA Police Department's priority is the safety of our students. Officers are trained here, know everything about the campus and respond immediately to any situation. The department offers a variety of crime-prevention, alarm and notification services, as well as evening escort and van services that operate throughout campus and local living areas. These services and resources combine to make UCLA one of the safest campuses in the country.
