At 91, George is one of our oldest Zipcar members. And he’s not slowing down anytime soon. “When you live a long time, you get to do a lot of things,” he said. George has had 4 children, fought in WWII, graduated from Yale, taught at the University of Illinois, worked ski patrol for 30 years, and is writing his third book. “I don’t know what keeps you young, but I’m very active.” Yep, we’re pretty sure we all want to be like George when we’re his age.
