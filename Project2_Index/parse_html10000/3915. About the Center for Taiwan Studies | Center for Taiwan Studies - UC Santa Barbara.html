Skip to main content Center for Taiwan Studies - UC Santa Barbara Main menu Home About Goals Publications News & Events Resources People About the Center for Taiwan Studies   The Center for Taiwan Studies (CTS) is affiliated with the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultural Studies, at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB). Its objective is to promote Taiwan-related scholarly activities in the social sciences, humanities, and other cultural areas in an academic venue in the United States. It provides a forum for the public and a vehicle to meet the professional interests of faculty and students from a variety of disciplines by supporting collaborative programs involving visiting writers and scholars, hosting conferences, publishing Taiwan literature in English translation, and by encouraging interdisciplinary scholarship and Taiwan-related campus activities. By hosting this array of activities and bringing prominent experts to the campus, CTS will make UCSB an important institution in the field, both nationally and internationally. As the importance of studying Taiwan and its culture on its own—rather than a minor subsidiary of China—becomes increasingly recognized, the programs planned for CTS will complement existing Chinese and Asian Studies programs offered at many universities. In promoting scholarly work and intellectual exchanges on Taiwan literature, culture, and society, these programs will also enable a better understanding of other topical issues in Asian Studies, such as the relations between China and Taiwan, the Taiwan issue in global politics, and security in the Asian-Pacific area during this century of globalization and China's ascendance in the global community.   The 2013 International Conference on Taiwan Stutdies at UCSB   Another successful International Conference on Taiwan Studies at UCSB was held on December 6 and 7, 2013!  This year’stheme, “Inter-flow and Trans-border:  Ocean, Environment, and Cultural Landscapes of Taiwan,” was explored by a variety of scholars whose interdisciplinary interests and expertise ranged from political science, children’s literature, film studies, art history, poetry, cultural studies, folklore, and religion, as well as translation of Taiwan literature into Korean and English.  The participants arrived to share their knowledge and ideas from universities in Taiwan, China, Japan, Canada and the United States.  The conference was separated into eight sections which included a time set aside for scholars to share their research interests and publications and to discuss and explore new areas of study and scholarship, and it concluded with a lively discussion on the subject of international collaboration of Taiwan Studies and Literature in English translation. Many of the scholars generously donated their published works to the UCSB East Asian library.  One such donation to the UCSB campus included a beautiful set of Collected Works of Kenneth Hsien-yung Pai(Bai Xianyong zuopin ji), 12 volumes,  published by Tianxia Wenhua Publishers, 2008, which was presented by Professor Shu-ling Horng, Director of the Graduate Institute of Taiwan Literature, National Taiwan University.  The Center for Taiwan Studies at UCSB is appreciative of all those who have partnered with them to further the study of the culture and literature of Taiwan in the international community and here in the U.S.  We would like to acknowledge thegenerous sponsorship of the Education Division of the Taipei Economic & Cultural Office in Los Angelesand the Graduate Institute of Taiwan Literature, National Taiwan University, who co-sponsored this event.  The Center for Taiwan Studies looks forward to the next conference with anticipation and to an exciting new year of educational activities, lectures, seminars and publications Contact Us Phone/Fax Tel: 805-893-5101 Fax: 805-893-5101 cts.ucsb.ustaiwan@gmail.com Mailing address The Center for Taiwan Studies Department of East Asian Languages and Cultural Studies HSSB 2226 University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-7060 U.S.A Campus Maps Visit us on Facebook Search Search College of Letters and Science UC Santa Barbara Accessibility Appropriate Use Webmaster ©2015 The Regents of the University of California.
