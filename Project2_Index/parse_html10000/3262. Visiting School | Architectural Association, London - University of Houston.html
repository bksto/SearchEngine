Through the workshop students will develop design strategies across scales that enable them to rethink the relationships between contemporary design tools, macro architecture and the urban environment. 'Inter Scaless' is a two-week workshop where students develop parametric design strategies that enable them to generate design scenarios across scales, while focusing on a given conceptual framework. The challenge this year is to rebuild the relationship between the Houston's channel border and the public urban structure of Houston, to generate a sense of place.
