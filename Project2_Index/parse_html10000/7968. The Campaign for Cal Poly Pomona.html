Launching a major fundraising campaign in the depths of a recession required a deep belief in the transformative power of a Cal Poly Pomona education. Exceeding our goal of raising $150 million required an unwavering commitment to that belief. More than 17,000 alumni, friends and members of the campus community participated with gifts ranging from a few dollars a month to a record-setting $42 million from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. To learn more about the campaign's successful completion, read the PolyCentric article. For more information about supporting the university's ongoing initiatives, visit Where to Give.
