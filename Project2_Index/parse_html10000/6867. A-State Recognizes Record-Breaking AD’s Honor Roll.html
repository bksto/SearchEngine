(3/5/15) – A school-record 208 student-athletes were recognized as part of Arkansas State’s fall 2014 Athletic Director’s Honor Roll during halftime of the Red Wolves’ men’s basketball game at the Convocation Center Thursday night. A-State Athletics and its student-athletes enjoyed their best semester ever in the classroom last fall, posting a 3.047 all-department GPA that was the highest in school history. The previous record was 3.029, which was set in fall 2013 when a then school-record 197 student-athletes found a spot on the AD’s Honor Roll. “Our student-athletes are just that – true students with athletic talent who are dedicated to both academics and winning championships,” said A-State Director of Athletics Terry Mohajir. “I am very proud of them for collectively putting together the best academic semester this program has ever seen. We are committed to seeing that these young people earn their degrees and are then placed in jobs where they will have career success. Our administration will continue to stress the importance of high academic achievement on a daily basis.” The Red Wolves continued to show their commitment to academics by posting at least gvva 3.0 all-department GPA for the fourth time in school history, and all four have come over the last six semesters dating back to spring 2012. Not only did 61 percent of all A-State student-athletes earn a place on the most recent AD’s Honor Roll, 39 of them held a perfect 4.0 GPA and over 80 were also members of the Chancellor’s or Dean’s List. Every member of the women’s golf, women’s cross country and women’s tennis squads made the AD’s Honor Roll. Twelve of A-State’s 16 sports posted at least a 3.0 team GPA, led by the women’s tennis squad with a 3.68. The other sports that hit a 3.0 included volleyball (3.61), women’s cross country (3.58), women’s golf (3.56), women’s indoor/outdoor track and field (3.51), women’s soccer (3.43), women’s bowling (3.36), women’s basketball (3.29), men’s baseball (3.22), men’s golf (3.06) and men’s cross country (3.01). The most recent (2013-14) Sun Belt Conference Commissioner’s List and Academic Honor Roll featured a combined 178 Arkansas State student-athletes, the second most in the league. The league’s 2014-15 lists will be announced at the conclusion of the academic year.
