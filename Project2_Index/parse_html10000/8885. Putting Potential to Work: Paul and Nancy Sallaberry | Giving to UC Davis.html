Now as proud parents of a UC Davis alumnus, they are inspired to give the next generation the same excellent Aggie experience they enjoyed and to which they credit their success. During The Campaign for UC Davis, the Sallaberrys gave to Intercollegiate Athletics, the Annual Fund, the Graduate School of Management, and several scholarships. “It’s truly amazing that my Aggie experience was the same as my son’s. The consistency—in both positive community values and world-class academics—is what makes UC Davis truly special. My major didn’t correlate to my career; but, the high expectations both academically and athletically, had a direct contribution to a high-tech career even though I didn’t realize it at the time,” said Paul Sallaberry, who is a partner with Jafco Ventures and has more than three decades of leadership experience in technology companies. “Our support of UC Davis is about preserving our positive experience and taking it to the next level for the next generation.” Sallabery’s own Aggie experience has continued to grow by his service on the UC Davis Foundation Board and the GSM’s Dean’s Advisory Council, which have been “some of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had.” He continued, “To all Aggies, I would say: there has never been a greater time to come home to UC Davis. Your alma mater needs you, at whatever level you can give. The Campaign for UC Davis has unleashed the true potential UC Davis has to be one of the greatest universities of the 21st century.” These ONE hundred stories represent the people who have transformed UC Davis through their generous support of our first comprehensive fundraising campaign. Together, these stories are the ONE story of The Campaign for UC Davis.
