Cherisse Jones-Branch Place of birth? Charleston, South Carolina Your philosophy on education in seven words: Embrace it, you might learn something new. Who was your favorite teacher (and why)? My 4th grade teacher Mrs. Lillie Jean Hill at Memminger Elementary School in Charleston, South Carolina. She, like my parents, always emphasized the importance of reading and education. What makes for a good student? Anyone who embraces the opportunity to become educated as well as earn a degree. What are you working on right now? A book on rural black women’s activism in Arkansas. Before you retire I want to... write at least five books. The television series I must DVR... Downton Abbey. The last book I read for fun was... Elizabeth I by Abigail Archer. What’s the value of a university education? It makes one a better American and a better global citizen. If I could travel anywhere it would be... West Africa or Fiji in the Pacific. My pet peeve is... people who judge without knowing. A perfect day is... sunshine, a good book, and a cup of tea. Cats or dogs? Cats. (But I love my dog Jynx.) E-book or hardback? Both. Dinner or supper? Dinner. I wish I could... read and write in my sleep. I could really get a lot done! Only my friends know... how comical I am. Dinner or supper? Supper My favorite saying is... “Try it. You just might like it.” Home A-State News News Article Calendar Inside A-State Theatre ASU-TV KASU 91.9 The Herald Convocation Center Fowler Center Bradbury Gallery Museum Red Wolves Athletics ASU Alumni Association Search A-State Contact University Communications news@astate.edu Phone: 870-972-3820 Fax: 870-972-3693 Postal Address: PO Box 2220 State University, AR  72467 Directories A-State Alerts Maps & Directions Employment Feedback Open Records Appropriate Use IT Security Accessibility ASU System Arkansas State University Jonesboro, Arkansas | (870) 972-2100
