The campus offers several tour options. An in-person visit is the best way to experience UC Merced and get a firsthand view of its classrooms, facilities and grounds. For those who cannot make the trip, an online virtual walking tour is available so you can see 360-degree views of residence halls and dining center accommodations, study areas in Kolligian Library, classrooms, laboratories and a host of other places and sights. When you are ready to plan an in-person visit, UC Merced’s Visitors Center offers tours for students and their families. These 60-minute walking tours, available by registering in advance, are led by student tour guides and accommodate no more than 20 people per tour guide so you get an intimate and memorable experience.  UC Merced also offers group tours for schools, community colleges and community-based organizations. People interested in arranging a group tour can download a group tour request form and email it or fax it to 209-228-4637.   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
