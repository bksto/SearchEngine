New treatments for veterans made possible through Kit Parker’s research on traumatic brain injuries. Breakthroughs in cancer therapies led by David Mooney. Innovations like these have Herbert S. “Pug” Winokur Jr. ’64, AM ’65, PhD ’67 excited about the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).“These three faculty have devoted their academic careers to creating solutions that will make the world a different and better place,” says Pug. “And these are just a few examples. For each of the 70-plus faculty members at SEAS, there are 70-plus stories just like these.” Pug and his wife, Dee, have established several gifts to expand the capacity of teaching and research at SEAS, including the Winokur Family Professorship of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Herbert S. Winokur Jr. Professorship of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Myron B Fiering SEAS Graduate Fellowship Fund, and the Herbert S. Winokur Jr. Fund to Support SEAS and the Allston Campus. “We think the success of SEAS is critical to the success of Harvard and to the Campaign for the next 25 years. SEAS is the entity that makes ‘One Harvard’ happen. You can’t study cyberlaw and privacy without knowing how computer programming and architecture work, make great strides in stem cell research without advances in computational science and bioengineering, or plan future cities without advances in applied mathematics.” The Harvard community is extremely important to Pug, who will celebrate his 50th Reunion this spring. “I give because I owe so much to people here and because I believe SEAS’ work will make a difference,” he says. While an undergraduate, Pug lived in Eliot House and concentrated in mathematics. He participated in Army ROTC, sold ads for the Crimson, and played squash. After graduating from the College, he earned his AM and PhD in decision and control theory from the Division of Engineering and Applied Physics, which later became SEAS. After working in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, he went on to a career in finance and private equity investment and now is chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings. A resident of Greenwich, Connecticut, Pug is an active philanthropist along with his wife and two daughters, Annick and Andra, and their spouses. He has helped to fund economic development and public health initiatives through the Harvard Law School Mississippi Delta Project (a project he initiated) and chairs the board of Squash Haven—a project that his daughter Annick and he cofounded in partnership with Yale University—which provides squash and academic instruction for students in New Haven inner city schools. “We most often want to support projects that help young people find educational or career support,” says Pug. Pug also is a committed Harvard volunteer. He currently serves as a SEAS co-chair for The Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences, a member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Campaign Steering Committee, and a chair for his 50th Reunion Campaign Committee. These positions give him many opportunities to talk about critical interdisciplinary collaborations between the Schools and the importance of SEAS in Harvard’s future. “There are so many fun things to talk about with SEAS’ innovations—like the Soccket Ball or RoboBees,” says Pug. “But there are so many that have implications that we won’t understand for a long time. I feel fortunate to be a part of it.” Arts & Culture Campus & Community Generosity Global Engagement Health & Medicine Multimedia Public Service Science & Engineering Student Experience Sustainability & Environment Teaching & Learning Innovation Alumni Login Login to update your profile, search the directory, find or become a mentor, and more.
