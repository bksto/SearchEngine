In order to accommodate you on your preferred date and time and to provide the best visit to WPI, we encourage you to register well in advance of your visit. To see availability and register, please view the calendar of upcoming dates and times. Visits to WPI last just over two hours and include an information session followed by a campus tour. The information session is an introduction to WPI and overview of the admissions process led by an admissions staff member and student intern. We'll discuss important details of the undergraduate academic program and details on the application and admission process. Following the information session, current WPI students will take you on a walking tour of our campus. On tour, you'll see academic buildings, classrooms, the library, a residence hall, the dining hall, our Sports & Recreation Center, and the Rubin Campus Center. Your tour guides will talk about their experiences as WPI students, and you may ask them questions about what it is like to attend WPI. In addition, student visitors who are here at 12 noon on weekdays during the academic year are treated to lunch with a WPI student host. Discount coupons are available for family members.   See Also Register for a visit Directions to Campus Campus Map Walking Tour App Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Academic Programs WPI At-a-Glance Living at WPI Your Perspective Applying to WPI Visit with Us Meet the Team Information Sessions & Campus Tours Saturday Visits Open Houses Personal Interviews Office Hours and Parking BEANS Virtual Tour Online College Fairs Pre-College Opportunities Request Information Admissions Calendar + There are currently no events in the calendar.
