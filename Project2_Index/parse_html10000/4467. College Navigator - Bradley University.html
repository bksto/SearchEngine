Beginning students are those who are entering postsecondary education for the first time. Title IV aid to students includes grant aid, work study aid, and loan aid. These include: Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG), National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant (National SMART Grant), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Federal Work-Study, Federal Perkins Loan, Subsidized Direct or FFEL Stafford Loan, and Unsubsidized Direct or FFEL Stafford Loan. For those Title IV recipients, net price is reported by income category and includes students who received federal aid even if none of that aid was provided in the form of grants. While Title IV status defines the cohort of student for which the data are reported, the definition of net price remains the same – total cost of attendance minus grant aid.

Retention Rates for First-Time Students Pursuing Bachelor's Degrees Percentage of Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2012 and Returned in Fall 2013 Interpret data with caution due to small cohort. The only part time student is still enrolled. Overall Graduation Rate and Transfer-Out Rate The overall graduation rate is also known as the "Student Right to Know" or IPEDS graduation rate. It tracks the progress of students who began their studies as full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking students to see if they complete a degree or other award such as a certificate within 150% of "normal time" for completing the program in which they are enrolled. Some institutions also report a transfer-out rate, which is the percentage of the full-time, first-time students who transferred to another institution. Note that not all students at the institution are tracked for these rates. Students who have already attended another postsecondary institution, or who began their studies on a part-time basis, are not tracked for this rate. At this institution, 80 percent of entering students were counted as "full-time, first-time" in 2013. Overall Graduation and Transfer-Out Rates for Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2007 Percentage of Full-time, First-Time Students Who Graduated or Transferred Out Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program (*) Not all institutions report transfer-out rates. Bachelor's Degree Graduation Rates Bachelor’s degree graduation rates measure the percentage of entering students beginning their studies full-time and are planning to get a bachelor’s degree and who complete their degree program within a specified amount of time. Graduation Rates for Students Pursuing Bachelor's Degrees Percentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Graduated in the Specified Amount of Time and Began in Fall 2005 or Fall 2007 6-Year Graduation Rate by Gender for Students Pursuing Bachelor's Degrees Percentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2007 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program 6-Year Graduation Rate by Race/Ethnicity for Students Pursuing Bachelor's Degrees Percentage of Full-time, First-time Students Who Began Their Studies in Fall 2007 and Received a Degree or Award Within 150% of "Normal Time" to Completion for Their Program  Programs/Majors Completions (Number of awards conferred) 2013-2014Completions are the number of awards conferred by program and award level.
