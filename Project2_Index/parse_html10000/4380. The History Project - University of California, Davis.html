They modeled the process for developing units of study and provided us with key strategies to support literacy through history content. As a result, our team has a much deeper understanding of the Common Core Standards and instructional shifts that will facilitate student learning."

Welcome to our community! “If you want to understand today, you have to search yesterday.” — Pearl S. Buck Kelman Wins Bancroft Prize! We are thrilled to share the news that UC Davis History Project Faculty Advisor, Ari Kelman, has won the Bancroft Prize! Columbia University awards this prize to two authors each year. When we traveled with Sacramento City and San Juan Unified teachers to Colorado in 2011 for Field Study, we were fortunate to hear directly from Kelman who accompanied us. During our visit to the historic Stanley Hotel, Kelman shared his research and previewed his now award-winning book, A Misplaced Massacre, which tackles the politics of history and memory surrounding the 1864 massacre in Sand Creek, Colorado. Later, while visiting the state capital we were able to view the monument installed on the Capital grounds with greater understanding informed by Kelman’s research. Join us in sending kudos to Kelman for this achievement! Read More Find us on...
