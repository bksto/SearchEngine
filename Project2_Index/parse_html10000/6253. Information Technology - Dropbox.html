CSUF Dropbox for Business Dropbox is a file hosting service that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. Drop any file into a designated folder where it is automatically uploaded to Dropbox's cloud-based service and shared with other Dropbox clients. Benefits and Key Features: Unlimited storage capacity, login with your campus account, and convenient access to data via Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and mobile using any web browser. Available to: Faculty and Staff Please Note: All links and permissions from the personal account will remain as they were set up. If your personal account already uses your @fullerton.edu address, you will have the option of migrating these files to a new personal account using a different email address (@gmail.com, for example), or migrating these files to your CSUF Dropbox account. If you were using your CSU Fullerton email as your personal account, you should inform non-work collaborators of your new address, as anything shared in the future with your CSU Fullerton email will end up in your CSUF Dropbox. Dropbox is also available for your iOS, Windows, and Android devices. The sign in and connect process for these devices is similar to the web version, and the file and folder views will also be the same.   If you have any questions, or need assistance, please contact the IT helpdesk at (657) 278-7777 or by email at helpdesk@fullerton.edu.     Get Started: Individual Accounts Use our walk through video to get started with Dropbox for Business.
