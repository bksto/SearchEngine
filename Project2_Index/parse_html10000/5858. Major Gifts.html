Your transformational gifts from cash, securities, real estate or other tangible personal property make a difference in providing a margin of excellence for our 28,000-plus students. Sacramento State provides donors with many opportunities for public recognition and naming opportunities. However you choose to help, your participation enables the University to continue to build a brighter future for the Sacramento community — and beyond. Learn more about how your annual support through the Sac State Fund can help with emerging opportunities. Consider a bequest, a gift of retirement plan assets, real property, or appreciated securities by contacting Sacramento State’s planned giving office. Establish an endowment, which allows Sacramento State to invest your gift of $10,000 or more to generate growth of principal and a growing payout stream to ensure funding in perpetuity. An endowment may be created to support a scholarship, program of your choice, faculty member, chair or fellowship; donors may name it in honor of an individual, family or group.
