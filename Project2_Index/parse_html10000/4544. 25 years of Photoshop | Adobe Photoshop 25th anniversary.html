Thank you, Adobe, for giving me the tools and opportunity to build my career.” “Without Photoshop I literally would not be able to do what I do. More often than not, the finished image goes beyond my expectations.” “I try to grab the attention of audiences through fantastical concepts and compelling compositions. My goal is to evoke powerful emotions and a genuine interest in what is happening in the image.” “Photoshop is more than a tool; it’s a member of the team. We’ve been using it for years and can’t wait to see what’s in store for the next 25 years.” Take a look back. Today, millions of people use Photoshop to do amazing things, transforming our visual culture and changing how we see the world.
