UC San Diego Counseling & Psychological Services Make an Appointment Make a free and confidential  appointment with a CAPS counselor by calling  858-534-3755 .  Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides individual, group, couples, and family psychotherapy to registered undergraduate and graduate students, including students of the Medical School and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Services are  free of charge  to currently enrolled students who have paid their registration fees. During the summer, students who were enrolled the previous Spring quarter and are intending to return in the Fall quarter are eligible for services.  Students consult with us about a variety of more specific personal, academic and relationship problems. No problem or concern is too big or small. Common issues students bring to CAPS are (but not limited to): Depression and suicidal thoughts Stress and anxiety Poor academic performance and study skills Roommate conflicts Homesickness and difficulty adjusting to the university Disappointing social relationships Alcohol and other substance use and abuse Difficulty in love relationships Loneliness and isolation Eating and body image problems Sexuality and sexual identity Back to UCSD Mobile © 2012 UC Regents CAPS Full Site | Feedback
