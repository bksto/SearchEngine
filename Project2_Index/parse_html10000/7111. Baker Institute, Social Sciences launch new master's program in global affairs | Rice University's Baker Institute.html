In the second year, students will pursue in-depth studies in one of three areas: international political economy, international security or international political development. This concentrated coursework will be combined with an internship and capstone workshop on the chosen topic, and will delve into real-world policy aspects of the subject. “We are proud to partner with the School of Social Sciences on this important degree,” said Baker Institute founding director Edward Djerejian. “At the Baker Institute, our goal is to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of public policy. Students in the program will benefit from our fellows’ expertise on key issues facing governments, the private sector and society today and the institute’s national and worldwide connections.” Applicants for the program are encouraged to have a B.S. or B.A. degree, approved GRE scores and excellent critical thinking and communication skills. Rice undergraduates may apply to the MGA program in the first semester of their junior year and, if accepted, take courses toward their master’s degree in their senior year while completing requirements for their baccalaureate degree. The deadline to apply for the MGA program for entry in fall 2015 is Jan. 5, 2015.
