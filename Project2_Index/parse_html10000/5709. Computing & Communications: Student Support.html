Services like e-mail, iLearn and the wireless network ensure that students stay connected with their peers, faculty and even the rest of the world. Using technology isn't just about school work though, and C&C has secured partnerships with several online music providers to provide students (and their iPods) with legal music for their enjoyment without denting their wallets. iGuide E-Mail R'Mail iLearn Legal2Share Wireless UCR NetID VPN Student Computing Services Website Student Computing Services Multimedia Technologies More Information  General Campus Information University of California, Riverside 900 University Ave. Riverside, CA 92521 Tel: (951) 827-1012 UCR Libraries Campus Status Campus Store Career Opportunities Diversity Maps and Directions Visit UCR Department Information Computing & Communications Computing & Communications Bldg.
