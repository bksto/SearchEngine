Forms Parents Faculty / Staff The Student Budget Overview As you make plans for your enrollment at Stanford, you should be aware of the estimated expenses that you will incur. The Financial Aid Office provides a standard budget that you may find helpful in your planning process. We use the standard budget to determine your eligibility for student loans. For a typical single graduate student living on-campus with no dependents, the standard budget is listed below. Students living off campus can expect living expenses to be 10% to 35% higher, depending on your living situation. Standard Budget 2015–2016 Academic Year Budget Item Academic Year Quarter 9 month (A/W/S) 12 month (4 Qtrs) Rent 3,885 11,655 15,540 Food 1,875 5,625 7,500 Personal Expenses 1,250 3,750 5,000 Transportation 410 1,230 1,640 Books and Supplies 490 1,470 1,960 Campus Health Service Fee 197 591 788 Cardinal Care Health Insurance* 1,560 4,680 4,680 Total Non-Tuition Expenses $ 9,667  $ 29,001 $  37,108 Tuition information for the 2015-2016 academic year is available from the Registrar’s website. 2014–2015 Academic Year Budget Item Academic Year Quarter 9 month (A/W/S) 12 month (4 Qtrs) Rent 3,730 11,190 14,920 Food 1,815 5,445 7,260 Personal Expenses 1,190 3,570 4,760 Transportation 410 1,230 1,640 Books and Supplies 490 1,470 1,960 Campus Health Service Fee 191 573 764 Cardinal Care Health Insurance* 1,432 4,296 4,296 Total Non-Tuition Expenses $ 9,258  $ 27,774 $  35,600 Tuition information for the 2014-2015 academic year is available from the Registrar’s website. *Cardinal Care is an annual plan (coverage extends through the summer regardless of your enrollment status). The annual cost is captured in Autumn, Winter and Spring charges. See the Vaden website for details. After your financial aid application has been processed, you will be able to view your individual budget in the Finances section of the Student page of AXESS. Your Tuition Charge The actual amount of your quarterly tuition charge depends on your school (Engineering students pay higher rates) and your number of units. Students with research or teaching appointment are typically permitted to enroll in no more than 8-10 units; those not working typically enroll in 11-18 units. Upper level graduate students may also register TGR. You can find your particular tuition charge amount on the Registrar’s Office—Tuition and Fees website. Estimated vs. Actual Expenses The budget amounts for tuition, campus health service fee and medical insurance exactly reflect the amounts that you will be charged on your University bill.  All other budget items are allowances meant to estimate the typical costs incurred by graduate students.  If your actual expenses are significantly higher than the allowances, you can submit documentation of your costs to the Financial Aid Office; we may be able to adjust your budget and increase your loan eligibility. Most students find the allowances to be a realistic estimate of a conservative budget. If your circumstances allow you to spend less than the standard budget you should consider borrowing less than your full eligibility. Family Expenses If you have children or other legal dependents, we may be able to add allowances for dependent care and other costs to your budget.  You should list all of your family members and any expected child-care expenses on your Graduate Student Loan and FWS Application. STEP Students If you will be enrolling in the STEP program through the School of Education, you can review your four-quarter student budget information on our STEP Students page.
