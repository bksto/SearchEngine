[Download MS PowerPoint here] Academic Affairs Division e-Newsletter Welcome to our first Academic Affairs e-newsletter. This newsletter is designed to let the campus know the many and the exciting things happening in Academic Affairs about students and faculty.   We are so pleased to welcome to CSUDH 18 faculty members appointed to full-time tenure/tenure-track positions for fall 2014. Congratulations and welcome to the Toro family!   We are very excited to have been awarded a $12.45 million grant by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) to educate Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers. We are one of seven CSU campuses who were awarded in DOE’s Teacher Quality Partnership Grant competition. Dr. Kamal Hamdan, associate professor and interim director of the new Center for Innovation in STEM Education at CSUDH is the principal investigator on the grant and will oversee the STEM Teachers in Advanced Residency (STAR) program.   It is with great pleasure to announce the inaugural CSUDH Faculty Recognition event celebrating full-time and part-time faculty accomplishments in the areas of Research, and Scholarly and Creative Activity (RSCA). This event, sponsored by the Office of Graduate Studies and Research and the Faculty Development Center will take place Wednesday, December 3, 2014, 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm in the University Library 5th floor.   On the heels of the very successfully symposium “Get HIP with Teaching!: High-Impact Practices in the Classroom and Beyond,” the Faculty Development Center has a call for applications for a series of new Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) to commence Spring 2015. FLC participants and leaders will earn professional development funds. Open to all faculty, whether you are brand-new to high-impact practices or are already familiar with them, apply to join FLC to explore ways to increase the impact of a practice you already implement.   We have so many things to celebrate! This newsletter will be our opportunity to highlight accomplishments, address campus topics, and invite feedback from our diverse vibrant community.
