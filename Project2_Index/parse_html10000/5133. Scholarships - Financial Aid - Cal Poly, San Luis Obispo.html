Criteria include financial need, scholastic achievement, participation in school activities, community service, honors and organizational affiliations, and educational objectives. Some scholarships have additional requirements which relate to a concentration or field of study, geographic origin, class level, and project or design portfolios. Generally, a student must have at least a 3.0 grade point average. Both undergraduate and graduate students are considered for scholarships. How to Apply Cal Poly does not require a scholarship application for incoming students. All incoming students are automatically considered for scholarships for which they qualify. However, for need-based scholarships, completing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is required. For priority consideration for financial aid programs and Cal Poly scholarships, complete the FAFSA by March 2. Selection for scholarships is made based on information from the admission application and/or the FAFSA for new students. Scholarships for continuing students are usually based on majors and are determined by the specific college or department. Continuing students should check in early spring with their department to find out if they are required to complete a separate application or if they will be considered automatically for any scholarships for which they qualify. Scholarship Notifications Scholarships are normally awarded during the spring and summer for the following academic year. During that time award notices are sent which include scholarship amount, disbursement and donor information. Recipients must be in good academic standing and maintain full-time enrollment while receiving a scholarship (continuing education and concurrent enrollment units are excluded). If you are offered a Cal Poly Scholarship(s), by accepting you consent to giving information about yourself; including your name, contact information and academic history to the scholarship donor(s) and/or committee(s). Consideration for scholarships may continue throughout the year. Recipients are required to thank their donor for the scholarship or award. Scholarships are awarded for an academic year and are typically disbursed in quarterly increments. Non-attendance will result in cancellation or a pro-rated amount. Cal Poly has almost 800 named scholarships in every college and almost every major.
