It is designed to be flexible, recognizing that many topics in this field cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. To enter the minor, students must have an overall GPA of 2.0 or better and must make an appointment with a departmental undergraduate adviser for approval in selecting a coordinated program of courses from within the department and related disciples. For further information, contact the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at (310) 825-1954. SEVEN courses required including: THREE from Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) M100, 101, 102, 103, 104, M105, M106, C110, C115, M120, 125, 130, M140, 141, 145, 150, C160, C170, 180, CM185 and FOUR additional courses (two of which must be upper division) from: Any of the above AOS courses beyond the minimum three required or from: AOS 1, 2, 3, 186 (186 must be taken twice) Chemistry and Biochemistry 103, 110A, 110B, 113A, C113B, 114 Earth and Space Sciences 15 Mathematics 115A, 115B, 132, 135, 136, 146, 170A, 170B Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 109, C119, 122, 123A or 123B, 147, 148 Physics 110A, 110B, 112, M122, 131, 132 Other relevant courses from related disciplines may be substituted with prior approval of the department.
