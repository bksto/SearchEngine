Worcester Polytechnic Institute About WPI Academics Admissions Research Campus Life Athletics Skip to Additional Navigation Home  > Academics > Departments, Programs & Initiatives > Aerospace Engineering > Undergraduate Programs Undergraduate Programs The Aerospace Engineering Program at WPI offers to its undergraduate students the option of a Major in Aerospace Engineering or a Minor in Aerospace Engineering . The Major in Aerospace Engineering leads to the Bachelors of Science (BS) degree and provides a comprehensive education in aeronautics and astronautics. The Major in Aerospace Engineering balances technical, mathematical, basic science, humanities and social science courses with project work. The Major prepares the students to become successful aerospace engineers, leaders in business, government and society.  The Minor in Aerospace Engineering is available for students who are not AE majors and are interested in broadening their exposure to and understanding of aerospace engineering. The Minor strengthens their career preparation and allows students to expand the opportunities open in the aerospace industry.   Faculty Profile Name: Nikolaos A.
