The island has two major mountain systems flanking a central valley that formed along an active fault zone. The mountains are rugged and cut by steep-sided canyons, some with perennial streams and freshwater springs. The coastline is mostly steep and rocky, with some protected coves and sandy beaches. Diverse habitats include rocky intertidal zones, coastal sage scrub, chaparral, grasslands, oak woodlands, and bishop pine forests. The reserve contains breeding grounds for harbor seals, seabird nesting colonies, many endemic plant and animal species, and well-preserved archaeological sites. Santa Cruz Island Reserve is protected, owned, and managed by The Nature Conservancy (TNC); the remainder of the island is managed by the National Park Service as part of Channel Islands National Park. Selected Research Archaeology: Ongoing studies of the island's prehistoric Native American cultures; the evolution of cultural complexity in hunter-gatherer societies. Terrestrial botany: Defense mechanisms of insular endemic plants; age structure in island chaparral communities; population genetics of endemic species. Terrestrial zoology: Reproduction and kinship studies for two endemic species: island jay and state-threatened island fox (Urocyon littoralis). Geology and geomorphology: Structure, diversity, and origin of the island's geological formations; fluvial system responses; sediment transport in island watersheds. Aquatic biology: Population studies of kelpbed fishes and selected intertidal invertebrates. Rare and sensitive taxa Inventory and monitoring of selected plant species; population genetic analysis; establishment of new outlying populations of selected taxa. Habitat restoration Management strategies for invasive nonnative species (feral pigs, feral honey bees, fennel); vegetation monitoring following removal of grazing impacts. Fire research and prescribed burns Impacts of fire on island plant species and communities; fire as a management tool for promoting native plants. Long-term studies Population studies of island fox, island jay, quail, native and non-native bees, and black abalone.
