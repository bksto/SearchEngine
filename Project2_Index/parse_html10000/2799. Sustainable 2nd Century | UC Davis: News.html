They’re also exploring more water-efficient ways to grow existing crops. 10.28.14 — Aiming for a carbon neutral future In November 2013, at her first Board of Regents meeting, University of California President Janet Napolitano announced a forward-looking sustainability effort that would have the entire UC system achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. The Carbon Neutrality Initiative commits UC to balancing its net greenhouse gas emissions from its buildings and vehicle fleet with renewable forms of energy, as well as reducing emissions from the outset through energy efficiency. 10.22.14 — No-till agriculture may not bring hoped-for boost in global crop yields, study finds No-till farming, a key conservation agriculture strategy that avoids conventional plowing and otherwise disturbing the soil, may not bring a hoped-for boost in crop yields in much of the world, according to an extensive new meta-analysis by an international team led by UC Davis. 10.15.14 — After the crash: Butterflies rely on connections amid changing climate Butterflies in Canadian mountain meadows rebounded after a severe population crash. Why? It’s all about connections, found a study by UC Davis in collaboration with Western University in Ontario, Canada, and other North American institutions. Features UC Davis, SunPower to build largest solar power plant in UC system UC and SunPower Corp. plan to build a 16-megawatt, ground-mounted solar power plant that is expected to generate 14 percent of UC Davis’ electricity needs. The university anticipates that, when the plant is completed in 2015, more than one-third of total electricity demand on campus will be served from carbon neutral energy sources. On completion, the project will be the largest solar power installation in the University of California system, and the largest solar power plant to offset the electricity demand of a U.S. university or college campus. UC Davis West Village: Setting the standard The University of California, Davis, West Village, the nation’s largest planned zero net energy community, racks up an impressive list of achievements in its initial year of review. The first formal analysis of West Village shows that even in its initial phases, it is well on the way to the ultimate goal of operating as a ZNE community. Pens are new addition to list of things we recycle Here at UC Davis we recycle bottles and cans, cardboard and Styrofoam, CDs and DVDs, fluorescent bulbs and sticky notes, toner and inkjet cartridges, batteries and electronics, and even wine corks. And paper, of course. But what about our pens? We can recycle those, too, and other, selected writing implements — adding more “cool” to UC Davis’ recent ranking as the nation’s “Coolest School” in Sierra magazine’s evaluation of sustainability in higher education. UC Davis is nation’s ‘Coolest School’ Sierra magazine has named the UC Davis the nation’s “Coolest School” for its efforts to address climate change and operate sustainably. Sustainability conference draws record participation They came. They saw. They studied — sustainability. The California Higher Education Sustainability Conference, held at UC Davis for the first time in the event’s 11-year history, drew record registration: nearly 1,000 people from 88 institutions, mostly in California — but also including institutions in three other states and four other countries.
