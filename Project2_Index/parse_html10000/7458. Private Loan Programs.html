Facts about private loan programs: Federal loan programs for undergraduates or graduate students may provide you with better terms and conditions. Before you borrow, pursue other types of financial aid, including outside agency scholarships. Remember that borrowing money is a serious responsibility: You must repay loans with interest. You don't need to file a FAFSA to obtain loans from private lenders. Read more about loans. Find private loans for both undergraduate and graduate/ professional students: Select a lender from one of the UC lender lists for private loans. Carefully review the benefits and repayment terms before you select a lender. Follow the instructions provided by your selected lender, who will notify you of your loan application status and any approved amount. You must sign a promissory note (a document that confirms your agreement to repay the loan), and sign the Application, Approval, and Final Disclosures. You must complete a Private Education Loan Applicant Self-Certification. Interest rates, fees, and payment terms will vary between lenders. Most lenders require payments to begin 6-9 months after graduation (or leaving school). Please note that federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.
