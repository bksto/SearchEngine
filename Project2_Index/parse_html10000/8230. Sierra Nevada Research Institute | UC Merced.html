On, above and below the Earth’s surface, from the mountain peaks to the Valley floor, SNRI affiliates from all three academic schools conduct cross-disciplinary research that affects not only the San Joaquin Valley, but the state, the nation and the world. The San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada regions of California are legendary for their vast natural resources, physical and biological diversity and cultural heritage. These regions lead the nation in agricultural production and in several natural resource and recreation industries. However, rapid population growth, competition for natural resources, air, water and soil pollution, climate change and competing land uses pose serious threats to the regions’ sustainability. SNRI operates a research facility in Yosemite National Forest – the only UC research station in a national park – and has an enduring partnership with the park for projects including groundbreaking research by faculty members and students, and leadership and environmental stewardship opportunities for students from all over the country.   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
