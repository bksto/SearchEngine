UCI’s unyielding commitment to rigorous academics, cutting-edge research, and leadership and character development makes the campus a driving force for innovation and discovery that serves our local, national and global communities in many ways. With more than 29,000 undergraduate and graduate students, 1,100 faculty and 9,400 staff, UCI is among the most dynamic campuses in the University of California system. Increasingly a first-choice campus for students, UCI ranks among the top 10 U.S. universities in the number of undergraduate applications and continues to admit freshmen with highly competitive academic profiles. Orange County’s second-largest employer, UCI generates an annual economic impact on the county of $4.4 billion. EXCELLENCE IN ACADEMICS & RESEARCH UCI fosters the rigorous expansion and creation of knowledge through quality education. Graduates are equipped with the tools of analysis, expression and cultural understanding necessary for leadership in today’s world. Consistently ranked among the nation’s best universities – public and private – UCI excels in a broad range of fields, garnering national recognition for many schools, departments and programs. Times Higher Education ranked UCI No. 1 among universities in the U.S. under 50 years old. Three UCI researchers have won Nobel Prizes – two in chemistry and one in physics. The university is noted for its top-rated research and graduate programs, extensive commitment to undergraduate education, and growing number of professional schools and programs of academic and social significance. Recent additions include highly successful programs in public health, pharmaceutical sciences and nursing science; an expanding education school; and a law school already ranked among the nation’s top 10 for its scholarly impact. A PRIME RESOURCE FOR THE COMMUNITY UCI’s students, faculty and staff reach beyond the classrooms and laboratories to address social issues and improve the human condition. UC Irvine Medical Center, Orange County’s only university hospital, recently opened a world-class facility, UC Irvine Douglas Hospital, housing the latest technologies and strengthening UCI’s ability to provide specialized medical and surgical treatments to the region’s citizens. A major intellectual and cultural center, UCI engages the community through many public activities and events. Renowned individuals speaking on campus include Nobel Peace Prize winner the XIV Dalai Lama, Jordan’s Queen Noor, British industrialist and Virgin Unite founder Sir Richard Branson, and United Nations messengers of peace Dame Jane Goodall and Charlize Theron. FUELING GROWTH & PROSPERITY In 2012-13, extramural funding – money coming from outside sources, including federal and state agencies, industry contracts and private foundations – in support of UCI research exceeded $300 million. Underscoring strong community support, private giving to UCI reached $80 million in 2012-13. The UC Irvine Foundation spearheads private fundraising efforts for the campus and, with the assistance of alumni and community leaders, helps ensure UCI’s future as a world-class research university. UCI benefits the community and the world in countless ways through its scholarly, scientific, creative and economic contributions. With a focus on the 50th anniversary celebration in 2015, UCI already has raised more than $880 million toward a $1 billion fundraising goal to support the campus’s continued excellence in research, teaching and public service in the decades ahead.
