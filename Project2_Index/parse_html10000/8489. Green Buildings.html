About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > Green College > Green Buildings Green Buildings Lewis Hall Our commitment to sustainability is evident in our new construction. Our Center for the Arts and Theatre Arts buildings offer about 42,000 square feet of new space for our arts and theater arts programs, giving the fine arts a consolidated home. The state-of-the-art spaces also demonstrate our commitment to reducing our environmental impact. The center, like other recently constructed buildings including Lewis Hall —a one-story, earth-sheltered, 14,484- square-foot “green” high-performance building—and all future campus construction, meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building standards. Some of the environmental performance indicators considered in LEED standards include erosion and sedimentation control, storm water management, water-efficient landscaping, storage and collection of recyclables, and recycled content.
