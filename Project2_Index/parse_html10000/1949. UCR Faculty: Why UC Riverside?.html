Faculty Profile Norm Ellstrand and Tracy Kahn UCR is more than just a place where solitary researchers reach their goals of personal discovery and professional advancement. The university is home to an increasing number of husband-wife faculty members, some of whom work together in the same department, often within walking distance of one another's labs. Norman Ellstrand, a professor of genetics and director of the Biotechnology Impacts Center, and Tracy Kahn, a lecturer in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences and curator of the UCR Citrus Variety Collection, have been married for 25 years. They met when he was an assistant professor and she was a graduate student. Now they are both established members of the department. "There are just three doors between us," said Kahn, a lecturer in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences and the curator of the UCR Citrus Variety Collection. Ellstrand is a professor of genetics in the same department. "We feel very lucky. I know his grad students and he knows mine. We enjoy each other's company and give each other added perspective on things."
