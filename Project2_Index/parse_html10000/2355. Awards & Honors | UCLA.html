The relentless UCLA appetite for success has become a tradition and legacy. And it sets an example for future generations of Bruins. More Information Faculty Honors Alumni and Student Honors Other Recent Honors Athletics With 112 NCAA Championships, UCLA Athletics is the most decorated program in the nation. Beyond graduation day, and far from campus, Bruins continue to redefine the possible. From Jackie Robinson and Troy Aikman to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Chase Utley, UCLA alumni are icons, record breakers, award winners, world champions and game changers. Currently, more than 110 alumni are professional athletes. We're the only university with a No. 1 overall pick in almost every major league's draft and the only university whose student-athletes have won the Heisman Trophy, the Wooden Award and the Golden Spikes Award. This tradition of excellence not only sets a standard of success for future athletes, it is a testament to what is expected of future generations at UCLA. The athletic tradition at UCLA extends far beyond the collegiate and national levels. In fact, Bruins have 250 Olympic medals, half of them gold. As the home of world-class champions, UCLA makes a statement as a global university — fueling the optimism and can-do mentality that uplift our academics and service and establish our status as one of the world's premier institutions.
