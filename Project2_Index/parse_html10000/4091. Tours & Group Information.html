Prospective Students University of Redlands > Prospective Students > High School Students & Guidance Counselors > Visiting the Redlands Campus > Tours & Group Information Tours & Group Information Individual Tours We’re told again and again that our campus tour is among the best, and we think once you take it, you’ll agree. Led by our talented group of student Admissions Hosts, your campus tour will take you through the highlights of the campus, from our discussion-focused classrooms to our residence halls, dining commons and athletic facilities. You’ll get a taste of the campus climate, student culture and academic variety offered through our many programs. Tours last approximately an hour and are often preceded or followed by an information session or interview with an admission counselor. Due to the high volume of  visitors during the spring semester, admissions appointments/interviews are reserved for high school seniors and information sessions are open to all visitors.   Walk-ins are welcome, although we strongly encourage you to reserve your space for our tours to ensure we have enough staff available. You can schedule a tour by calling the Office of Admissions at 800-455-5064 or by completing our Online Visit Request form.   Plan to arrive at the Willis Center approximately 10 minutes prior to the tour to check in. During the academic year (September through Mid-April)  Monday through Friday at 10 a.m., 1 p.m. and 4 p.m Saturdays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Please note that we may offer a reduced tour schedule during holidays, breaks, May Term, and finals week. Information Sessions An information session is an informal presentation for visiting families done in a group setting with an Admissions Counselor after our 10 am and 1 pm tours. Information regarding the university and the application process is covered. Families will have plenty of time for Q&A.  Offered during the Spring semester, Monday through Friday at 11:15 a.m and 2:15 p.m. Group Tours Redlands provides group tours for students in grades 9-12 on a limited basis. An overview of the University may also be requested. Group tours generally consist of an hour-long campus tour and a half-hour overview with an Admissions Counselor. If you would like to schedule a group tour and/or an overview, please contact our Tour Coordinator at 800-455-5064. Group tours and overviews need to be scheduled at least three weeks in advance. Please note that lunch is not provided, but arrangements can be made for groups to purchase meals at the Dining Commons. Our Visit Coordinator can assist you in making these arrangements. At this time the Office of Admissions cannot accommodate group tours and overviews for students below the high school grade level. Due to the high volume of individual visits during spring semester, we are unable to accommodate any group tour from March 1 to May 2.
