Sustainable, thoughtfully designed buildings. Students, faculty, and staff connect indoors and out The Climate An exceptionally mild climate allows campus life to overflow into our many courtyards, plazas, and open spaces all year long The Scenery Comprising a full 8,000 acres of foothills and plains, the Stanford campus began as a horse farm and still fondly known as "The Farm." The Transportation You can leave the car behind. At Stanford, nearly everything is just a very pleasant bike ride away The Activities Students establish clubs that support their interests and sign up to participate in a wide range of activities The Mascot When it comes to school mascots, nothing tops the Stanford Tree. Everyone's favorite evergreen is always on hand to get the crowd on its feet Students at Stanford GSB enjoy myriad benefits during their time on campus. The Unique Environment Our year-round sunshine and balmy climate allow for outdoor living, bringing people together in outside spaces. Our new classrooms, study areas, and other facilities were constructed with an emphasis on technology, collaboration, and sustainability. A Diverse Student Population Students arrive from more than 50 countries, with many different educational, professional, and social backgrounds. Our collaborative educational process benefits from these diverse backgrounds, encouraging a range of perspectives and approaches to real-world problems. This diversity encompasses personal experiences and goals, culture, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and more. Student Support International students seeking assistance with visas or students looking for an affinity group or other support will find the resources and services they require. A Full Life Beyond the Classrooms Energetic and engaged students organize and participate in a variety of social and interest- or career-oriented activities. Students also have access to groups, events, and facilities across the larger Stanford University campus. Integrated Living and Working A range of residential options encourages collaboration and enables students to benefit from the diverse community. Single students, married students, and students with families will all find a living space that’s right for them. Extraordinary Surroundings Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, there’s no better place to study business. The San Francisco Bay Area provides endless opportunities for cultural enrichment, easy access to the outdoors, and fun.
