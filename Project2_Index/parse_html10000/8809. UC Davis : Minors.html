About Minors A minor can be an great way to pursue an interdisciplinary or area-specific course of study. You can develop skills outside your major, investigate potential career paths or simply indulge a personal interest. Minors consist of 18 to 24 units of upper-division coursework. Because a minor requires fewer courses to complete than a full major, you may even want to pursue more than one minor. Most majors also exist as minors. Several unique minors are not offered as majors, such as History and Philosophy of Science; Contemporary Leadership; Economy, Justice and Society; Construction Engineering and Management; and many others. Benefits of Having a Minor Minors are especially beneficial if you plan to pursue a career in a specific industry, but also want to make sure you develop general academic or employment skills. For example, if you’re interested in management and the technology industry, you might choose to major in managerial economics and minor in computer science; or if a career in diplomacy is your goal, you could major in international relations and minor in a foreign language. Expand your horizons—meet with an adviser early in your course of study to see if a minor might be right for you.
