Hilton College – San Antonio Conrad N. Hilton College – Lima Global Hospitality Master's Program Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor Inductees Gourmet Night Sugar Land Wine & Food Affair Cougar Grounds Barron’s Restaurant Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor Recognizing industry leaders since 1996, the Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor is an exceptional educational resource for students pursuing careers in hospitality management, for people working in the profession and for individuals interested in one of the world's leading industries. The more than 60 men and women who’ve been inducted into the Hall of Honor—names like J.W. Marriott, Conrad N. Hilton, Ray Kroc, Ernest and Julio Gallo, Walt Disney and Vernon Stouffer—represent the world’s most successful hospitality companies and most recognizable brands. Every year, Hilton College hosts a formal reception, induction ceremony and dinner for a new class of inductees. Those events, along with a series of industry-related “Think Tanks,” are planned and executed by a team of student managers. The Hall of Honor Gallery, located off the main lobby of the Hilton University of Houston, features specially commissioned portraits of each inductee by artist Robert Lapsley. Personal papers, memorabilia and corporate histories are archived and displayed in the Massad Family Library Research Center and Hospitality Industry Archives at Hilton College to memorialize the inductees' achievements and leadership—providing a lasting tribute to the companies they conceived and built during their lifetimes. Members of the Hall of Honor Board of Overseers, including representatives from the American Hotel & Lodging Association, the National Restaurant Association, Hilton College and past inductees, nominate and elect each year's inductees into the Hall of Honor in the fall. On October 21, 2015, Chris Nassetta, president & CEO of Hilton Worldwide, will be inducted into the Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor. This year, this globally promoted event will also include the opening of an exhibit of the Hospitality Industry Archives, which celebrates the Hilton legacy and its influence on the hospitality industry—past, present and future. For information on tickets and other ways to support this important industry event, contact faculty mentor Alexis Hoey at 713.743.2432 or ahoey@uh.edu.
