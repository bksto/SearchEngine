A vital entry to a world of discovery and creativity for individuals and communities of scholars at the University of Arizona, the Libraries strive to be at the forefront of providing unlimited access to information in a customer-centered environment where traditional and emerging information services converge. Notable among the comprehensive collections in the Libraries are specializations in the fields of Science and Engineering, Architecture, Art, Music, History, and Languages. The Libraries' Special Collections has a regional focus on the Southwest and on Preserving Tucson's History and is home to rare books and manuscript collections, photographs and graphics. Your gift to the Libraries helps us do great things, as it directly benefits University of Arizona students and faculty. You help the Libraries acquire, organize and make accessible the tremendous amount of information resources, in electronic and print form, that are available today. Your gift to the UA Libraries is essential for us to continue to provide important services to the University community and beyond. First-class library services support a first-class university.  We also invite you to become a special Friend of the University Libraries. The University Libraries offer an introspective quality, they are there to go beyond what’s offered in the classroom. They open the door to self-study. —J.A.
