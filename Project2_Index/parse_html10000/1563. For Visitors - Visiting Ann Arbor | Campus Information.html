Campus Information was developed largely in response to the lack of centralized information at the University of Michigan. People were frustrated with going to the wrong place, not getting the information needed, and discovering too late that the university had a service or facility that could have helped them. These problems were aggravated by the university’s large size and decentralized nature. Therefore, in 1978, the first proposal was made to implement a system to solve that problem. To deal with this issue we operate sites both on central and north campus.

Google Plus One Fun Winter Activities            It’s safe to say that winter, and especially the holiday season, in Ann Arbor is magical. With lights in the trees that line most streets, people roaming around with those hard-to-miss Starbucks holiday cups, and the perfect amount of snow on the ground, there is hardly a better place to spend the season. While just walking from place to place can provide you with plenty of holiday cheer, there are a few activities that I personally love to do this time of year in Ann Arbor.
