This support may include helping you to perform better academically, to cope with your emotions, or to be more effective in your relationships with others. The University environment can be exciting and challenging. It also can be highly stressful since you may face academic pressures as well as demands from family, friends, and loved ones at the same time. While we work with students who may be experiencing a crisis, our goal is to help you deal with your concerns before they develop into more serious problems. Qualified, caring staff Counseling Center services are performed by psychologists and counselors, counseling interns, and counseling practicum students. All full time staff members are licensed mental health practitioners and services are always performed by those whose skills and training are appropriate to the task. The Counseling Center is a department within the division of Student Affairs. Our objective is to provide services not just at the Center, but also to the entire ASU community. Center staff members provide lectures and workshops at sites across campus, in the residence halls, and to student organizations. Counselors are also available for consultation to academic departments and other University offices. In addition, staff members frequently teach courses offered through the College of Education and  University College. Accreditation The Arkansas State University Counseling Center is fully accredited by the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS). The Counseling Center was evaluated by IACS against high standards of counseling practice and was found to offer competent and reliable professional services to its clientele. Approval by IACS is also dependent upon evidence of continued professional development as well as demonstration of excellence of counseling performance. Faculty and Staff: You may be the first to recognize that a student needs help, and are often the one who can guide the student to professional resources.
