As the School moves from excellence to true distinction, a substantial increase in private support from both individuals and organizations will be vital.   New Innovative Space to be Added The Merage School’s exciting new campaign — Building for the Future — is a $50 million building initiative that will take our remarkable business school to new heights of excellence in student learning opportunities, faculty research, community engagement, and facilities and grounds.    Several different campaigns are underway in support of the building initiative including:   Significant Naming Opportunities Alumni Class Gifts Auditorium Seat Naming through the Dean's Leadership Circle Corporate Partners campaign Planned Giving Endowment gifts Already, a number of generous donors have set the foundation for success.   The new building will be a showcase of Orange County’s premier business community and the partnerships launched between the Merage School and the entrepreneurs, executives and philanthropists who have supported our efforts. Much of the Merage School’s increasing reputation and visibility can be attributed to the innovative curriculum, executive programs and research conducted and presented by the School and its highly regarded faculty.  The prestige and advancement experienced by the Merage School have been enhanced by a significant partnership with the business community in Orange County and beyond.  The corporate community has perceived a substantial asset to this partnership due to the value-added activities that the School provides and has, as a result, already made a strong financial commitment to help support the School’s activities.   Groundbreaking January 9, 2013   As the Merage School plans for the next phase of rich history, we welcomed over 500 friends, supporters, and community leaders at our Groundbreaking celebration on January 9th.
