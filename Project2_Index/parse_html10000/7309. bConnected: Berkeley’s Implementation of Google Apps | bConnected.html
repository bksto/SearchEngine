All of the current bConnected Google services at UC Berkeley are available to us via a systemwide contract that UCOP negotiated with Google to meet UC Regents statutory requirements. Currently, the Google Core Services on the Berkeley campus include: Email Calendar Drive Contacts WHAT IS NOT ENABLED? Google offers other integrated services that are not currently part of the contract with Berkeley. Some services, such as Google+, are not available through bConnected because they fall under Google's separate “commercial terms of service.” These terms violate a Regent’s standing order, which means that the terms technically also violate state law. Before these apps can be enabled, Berkeley needs an exception to the terms of service, or Google must change the way these apps are categorized. Other services, such as Groups, are not available due to either privacy issues, or the need to assess how they fit into our existing environment. For example, the Groups tool has implications for identity management (CalNet). Before these apps can be enabled, the University must weigh the value to our mission against the attendant support costs and security risks of using the products.  WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE FUTURE? Currently, Campus IT (Educational Technology Services, Campus Shared Services and IST) is working closely with the Office of the CIO and UCOP risk management groups to evaluate how to provide and support additional cloud apps and services while following the terms of service and protecting privacy and security.   Changes are imminent. For example, Google has announced that the video conferencing service Hangouts is now a “core” service, which will decouple Hangouts from Google+ and make it subject to our UC contract terms. As our domain is a data restricted location, work is underway to make this change and we will likely see Hangouts available to Berkeley within a few months. We are also working diligently to obtain a Google exception to the terms of service, which would allow UC Berkeley to enable many additional Google services. Working together, we are confident that UC Berkeley will find a sensible path forward that balances access to services, policy, individual choice, and institutional guidelines around the use of Google’s services.
