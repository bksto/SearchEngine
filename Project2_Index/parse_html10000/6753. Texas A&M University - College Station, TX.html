Skip to content Giving to Texas A&M One University. Four Ways to Give. Learn More Learn More Learn More Learn More From the first gathering at Fish Camp to the last name called at Muster, Texas A&M's academic, social and athletic environments are steeped in great traditions. Perhaps one of the strongest and most enduring traditions is the sense of responsibility that Aggies have to their university and their drive to make it even better for generations still to come. The men and women who fuel this movement represent an incredible array including former students and friends of A&M as well as corporations and foundations. Together their generosity, whether the gift is large or small, provides more than $105 million each year, which underwrites a full spectrum of activities, programs and initiatives. Four fund-raising organizations, the 12th Man Foundation, The Association of Former Students, The George Bush Presidential Library Foundation, and the Texas A&M Foundation, enable donors to make a difference in the areas they are passionate about.
