Registration & Tuition Financial Support Campus Services Graduate Student Life Graduate Student Resources Campus Events Health & Wellness Housing & Family Services Campus Safety Parking & Transportation Computer and Technical Services Graduate School Survival Guide Registration & Tuition Admission, Registration & Enrollment Each applicant admitted to a graduate program at UCLA receives an online official offer of admission letter containing their UCLA ID number, a link to the online Statement of Intention to Register (SIR) and a Statement of Legal Residence. Once these are submitted online, the admitted applicant is entered in the Registrar's database through MyUCLA.   If a final transcript, degree diploma, or other documentation confirming the undergraduate degree was requested on the checklist accompanying the admission letter, it must be delivered to Graduate Admissions/Student Academic Services no later than November 1 to ensure continuing registration and enrollment as a graduate student at UCLA.   Registration consists of paying fees and enrolling in classes. Registration fees and other University charges are paid through BruinBill. BruinBill is an electronic bill (eBill) that students view in MyUCLA. See sections titled "BruinBill" and "Online Account Access Through MyUCLA and eBills." Enrollment in classes is completed via MyUCLA. See the section titled "MyUCLA". Students must complete both processes by the established deadlines to be officially registered and enrolled for the term.   Graduate students must be either registered and enrolled or on an official leave of absence every term until their degrees are awarded. As an exception, certain graduate students may be eligible to pay the filing fee. Failure to register or be on an official leave of absence for any term constitutes withdrawal from UCLA.   California Residence for Tuition Purposes To establish California residence, students must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen who has been physically present in the state for more than one year, and must be able to provide convincing evidence that their intent for the entire year has been to establish a permanent residence in the state. Students must also be financially independent, as defined by the UC Office of General Counsel, if their parents are not California residents.   Students must demonstrate their intent to make California their home by severing their residential ties with their former state of residence and establishing those ties with California shortly after arrival. If the requisite intent is not demonstrated promptly, the waiting period for residence classification will be extended until both presence and intent have been demonstrated for the entire one-year period. Note: This summary is not a complete explanation of the law regarding California residence and is subject to change.   Continuing nonresident students for fee/tuition purposes who wish to be classified as a California resident must file a Petition for Residence Classification by the deadline for the applicable term. The petition is also available from the Registrar’s Office.   MyUCLA MyUCLA gives UCLA students, and those who have been students within the past 10 years, real-time access to their University academic, personal and financial records. It is the easiest way to enroll in classes. MyUCLA operates Sunday 12 noon through Tuesday 1 a.m., and Tuesday through Saturday from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m., including holidays. Access is based on students' UCLA username/password.   Paying Fees (Schedule of Classes) Details on fee amounts, fee payment, enrollment procedures, and deadlines are in the Schedule of Classes. Students may review their BruinBill account at any time through MyUCLA, and make payments during their session. These online payments can include BruinPay Plan, echeck, MasterCard, Discover or American Express with a 2.75% base transaction. Payments by cash only can be made in person at the Administrative Main Cashier Office (1125 Murphy Hall) at their customer service windows.   Annual Graduate Fees Although the exact cost of attending UCLA varies, there are some fees that all UCLA students must pay. Each entering and readmitted student is required to submit a Statement of Legal Residence to Graduate Admissions with the Statement of Intent to Register. Legal residents of California are not required to pay tuition. Students classified as nonresidents must pay annual tuition in addition to registration fees. For a definition of residence and nonresidence, see the previous section titled "California Residence for Tuition Purposes". Fees are subject to change without notice by The Regents.   Students in the Schools of Dentistry, Law, Management M.B.A. program, Medicine, Nursing, Theater, Film, and Television, Public Policy, and Public Health should refer to the online Schedule of Classes for explanation of additional fees.   Miscellaneous Fees Miscellaneous fees include charges for late registration fee payment. Late fees also apply if students file their Study List late or do not pay off BruinBill balances on time. Fees are charged if any check is returned by a bank for any reason. Charges are assessed for most petitions and other special requests. There is also a fee for advancement to doctoral candidacy.   BruinBill UCLA uses a readily accessible financial system known as BruinBill to assist students in managing their account and to generate fellowship stipend, loan, and other need- and merit-based aid payments. The University records all billing (such as tuition, nonresident supplemental tuition, and Student Health Services charges) and all UCLA aid payments through the BruinBill system. Each month students need to review transactions posted to their BruinBill account using MyUCLA. See section below titled "Online Account Access Through MyUCLA & eBills".   With BruinBill, aid funds-including ASE and RA fee remissions, fellowships, training grant payments, loans, and other awards–will automatically apply towards the payment of fee and tuition bills. For students who have a fellowship package from their department or the Graduate Division that fully covers fees and tuition, these charges will be automatically paid through BruinBill. Any remaining funds after their bills have been paid will be disbursed as a credit refund through Bruin Direct.   BruinDirect: Electronic Deposit of Funds All recipients of fellowship awards and traineeships are required to sign up for BruinDirect to have their stipends deposited directly into personal bank accounts. Students who have not signed up for BruinDirect will have all refund checks mailed to the recipient's mailing address. Recipients of monthly stipends who have not signed up for BruinDirect will likely experience a delay of up to a week in receiving their checks. Monthly checks for those who have not signed up for BruinDirect will be mailed to the recipient's mailing address, even if it's a foreign or out-of-state address, and will not necessarily be mailed before the first of the month.   Online Account Access Through MyUCLA & eBills Students can view their monthly BruinBill transactions and direct deposit refund activity in real-time through MyUCLA, UCLA's web-based student information system. Around the first of each month an eBill e-mail is sent to all students as a reminder to review their BruinBill accounts in MyUCLA. Transactions are listed by the month in which they occurred. In addition to the current month activity, students can view monthly statement activity going back 24 months. Charges posted this month are due by the 20th (or previous working day if the 20th falls on a weekend or holiday) of next month.   Financial Support UCLA Fellowships & Grants Merit-based awards provide stipends in varying amounts and may include fees and nonresident tuition. Awards are competitive and open to all graduate students.   Extramural Fellowships Merit-based support provided by national, international or private foundations. Many organizations accept applications up to a year before acceptance into a graduate program.   Financial Aid Funding based on financial need is available only to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Financial aid includes loans and work-study awards.   Teaching & Research Assistantships Teaching Assistantships provide experience in teaching undergraduates with faculty supervision. Graduate Student Researcher positions provide experience working on faculty-supervised research projects. Selection of awardees for teaching assistantships, graduate student research positions, registration tuition grants and nonresident supplemental tuition fellowships is conducted by each department. Students should contact their department for application procedures and deadlines.   Campus Services BruinCard A BruinCard is your passport to life at UCLA.
