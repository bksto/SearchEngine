The appointed Chair of the Committee, along with the HAA staff liaison, request nominations for the recipients of the Harvard Medal and the HAA Alumni Award (see descriptions below). Email suggestions to Kate Freed.  Nominations received in a given year shall be carried over to the next year automatically. Each nomination shall be reviewed every three years to determine whether it merits continued consideration. Spirit and Purpose of the Harvard Medal The principal objective of the awarding of the Harvard Medal is to recognize extraordinary service to Harvard University. Extraordinary service can be in as many different areas of University life as can be imagined, including teaching, fundraising, administration, management, generosity, leadership, innovation, labors in the vineyards. The following kinds of people may serve as examples of those especially eligible for consideration for the Harvard Medal: Alumni/ae of Harvard University Former Overseers, members of the Harvard Corporation or Radcliffe Trustees Former members of the staff or faculty of the University Members of organizations affiliated with the University such as the HAA and graduate school alumni associations, Visiting Committees or support groups for institutions such as the Fogg or sports teams The following shall not normally be considered for the Harvard Medal: An active member of the Governing Boards, faculty, or staff An individual on the occasion of his or her retirement A deceased person If a candidate has previously received an honorary degree, consideration will be given to total service over the years, with principal emphasis on service subsequent to receipt of the honorary degree. Potential receipt of an honorary degree from the University shall be irrelevant in consideration of a nominee for an award. Review of nominations by the Corporation each year will safeguard against a person receiving both honors in the same year. Past recipients of the Harvard Medal (PDF) Spirit and Purpose of the HAA Award The purpose of the HAA Award is to recognize outstanding service to Harvard University through alumni activities and to encourage continued commitment to Harvard in the future. Devoted service may be reflected in significant commitment to a Club, Schools and Scholarships Committee, class, fund, or other activity substantially benefiting Harvard University. Alumni of Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges, the graduate schools, and the Extension School who have significantly contributed to the University through alumni activities are eligible. Persons not eligible for the HAA Award include current members of the Governing Boards, faculty and staff, or deceased persons. Normally, persons who have received an honorary degree or the Harvard Medal also will be ineligible. Up to six awards may be made in a given year except in special anniversary years. The awards will be presented at an official meeting of the HAA apart from Commencement or at another occasion appropriate in light of the particular service of the recipients. For each recipient a citation will be read and an award commemorating the devoted service to Harvard will be bestowed.
