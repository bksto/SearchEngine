The annual conference first took place in 2012, and has grown in popularity each year. The goal of this event is to provide undergraduates with opportunities to learn from alumni serving in a variety of public interest fields and to strengthen the alumni community for those working in and committed to the public interest sector. The Public Interested Conference was one of many events held this past January as part of Wintersession, the period of time between Winter Break and the beginning of the new semester which allows students to return to campus to participate in a variety of programs.
