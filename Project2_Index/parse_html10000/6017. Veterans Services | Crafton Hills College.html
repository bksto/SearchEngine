Attention Post 9/11 Benefit Recipients In an effort to reduce outstanding fees to the V.A. the CHC Veterans Office is making changes to the certification process.  Beginning Spring 2015 priority registration period, you will now be required to submit your Request for V.A. Benefits form to the Certifying Official PRIOR to the beginning of Open Registration.  Failure to do so will result in the student owing all fees IMMEDIATELY, and potentially be dropped for non-payment.  The Veterans Certifying Official is located in the Admissions & Records Office, SSA-212.
