From his New Orleans beginnings and fiery debut with legendary drummer Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers to his current role as artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, he inspires and uplifts people through superb music making. Since 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble. From swinging to supple, sophisticated to spirited, it’s all sheer jazz perfection — it’s no wonder these annual appearances have become a favorite of UMS audiences.
