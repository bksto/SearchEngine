Laboratory The Student Health Services offers a full-service laboratory, which performs many tests in-house.  Any tests we are unable to perform are sent to an outside reference laboratory. The reference lab picks up from Student Health daily and turn-around time for results is excellent. The lab is state-licensed, CLIA certified, and COLA accredited, and is staffed by experienced, licensed clinical lab scientists. Laboratory hours are Mon-Fri 8:30am-4:00pm, except Thurs 9:00am-4:00pm. Lab requests are honored from physicians here at Student Health, and from outside providers. Personal requests for some screening tests may be made through our treatment nurse. Students covered by the UCR Student Health Insurance Plan (USHIP or GSHIP) do not pay lab fees if testing is requested as a result of illness or injury. Private paying students who do not have USHIP or GSHIP are responsible for any lab fees incurred.   Vision Care Until September 22, 2014 Graduate students enrolled in UCR GSHIP should contact Anthem Blue Vision for provider and complete benefit information.
