The community at The Pennovation Works will translate new ideas and research into products, into ventures, into services that will change the world. Innovation will be the key.” – Amy Gutmann, Penn President What’s in The Works? Pennovation Works The 23-acre property adjacent to Penn’s campus will accommodate Penn affiliates, including researchers, entrepreneurs, and industry partners By grouping facilities for innovation, technological development, and artistic production/exhibition, Penn envisions a multifaceted workshop for harnessing and commercializing the tremendous creative potential in the region. The Pennovation Works is a unique blend of offices, labs, and production space being developed by The University of Pennsylvania to bridge the intellectual and entrepreneurial initiatives for advancing knowledge and generating economic development. The master plan articulates a phased approach, with initial activity focused on site improvements and renovating existing buildings, beginning with the creation of the Pennovation Center. The 23-acre property adjacent to Penn’s campus will accommodate Penn affiliates in state-of-the-art facilities, including researchers, entrepreneurs, and industry partners solving real world problems and translating inventiveness into viable ventures. The Pennovation Works will be anchored by the Pennovation Center, a new incubator and accelerator that will provide lab space and a hub for collaboration and the exchange of ideas for innovators from all disciplines. This property is strategically situated in a valued location at 34th Street & Grays Ferry Avenue within the Lower Schuylkill Innovation District, and is envisioned to become a keystone securing University City, Center City, and the emerging Innovation District as three engines of Philadelphia’s economy.
