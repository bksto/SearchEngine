Filing a FAFSA or Dream Act Application A variety of aid is available for all income levels. Whether or not students think they are eligible, we encourage them to apply for financial aid each year. The annual priority filing deadline for State and University grant consideration is March 2. Applying begins with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at fafsa.gov or the California Dream Act Application at dream.csac.ca.gov. Both applications are free. The 2015-2016 FAFSA and Dream Act Application is now available as of January 1, 2015. The information provided on the FAFSA or Dream Act Application is used to calculate your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC is used by UC Davis to determine your eligibility for financial aid. You can apply for financial aid before you know if you are admitted or taxes have been completed–so don't wait, apply as soon as possible. The important things to remember are: Apply early! Applications become available early January for the upcoming academic year Submit your application by March 2 for priority consideration Include the UC Davis School Code: 001313 Select the correct aid year on the FAFSA or Dream Act Application when applying (i.e., 2015-2016 for Fall 2015 admission) Keep copies of your tax returns and other documents in case they are needed Reapply every year There are several tools available to assist you in estimating your financial aid eligibility. The UC Davis Net Price Calculator can be used to estimate financial aid for those considering UC Davis If you would like a detailed description how the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is calculated, visit the EFC Formula Guide website Continuing Cal Grant Recipients If you are already a Cal Grant recipient, there is no need to submit a GPA verification form. Your eligibility for Cal Grant is evaluated annually. You can verify your renewal through WebGrants4Students. Applying for Cal Grants Students apply for a Cal Grant when they submit the FAFSA or Dream Act Application. Cal Grant applicants are also required to submit a GPA Verification form directly to the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) by March 2 as part of the application process. Students can access the Cal Grant GPA Verification Form for FAFSA filers or Dream Act Application filers from the CSAC website. Be sure to select the appropriate form based on which application you filed. CSAC determines eligibility and notifies the student by sending a California Aid Report (CAR). You can monitor and manage your Cal Grant account on the CSAC website. Applying for Scholarships at UC Davis Entering freshmen and transfer students apply for scholarships when they complete the UC Application for Admissions and Scholarships. Current UC Davis undergraduates can apply for scholarships by completing and submitting the Continuing Undergraduate Scholarship Application once it becomes available in October through the early January deadline. Detailed information about the application process is available in our undergraduate scholarships section. Application Tips File the FAFSA or Dream Act Application each year by March 2 for priority consideration. Upon successful completion of your financial aid application you will receive a confirmation notice that your application has been properly submitted. Include UC Davis School Code 001313 and a housing code on your application. Immediately respond to any requests from the Financial Aid Office. Accuracy is important when you apply for financial aid. All information is subject to verification according to state and federal regulation. False statements or misrepresentations may be cause for the reduction, cancellation, denial or repayment of financial aid. It is crucial to file the FAFSA or Dream Act Application by the March 2 priority filing date. If you filed a return, use information from your return to complete the application. For those who have not filed a tax return: If you plan to file, select "will file" on your application and use estimated tax/income information to submit your application. You must update your application information as soon as you have filed your tax return.    If you will not file a return, use your current financial information such as W-2s, last years final pay stub, and bank statements. FAFSA provides a tool that allows parents and students to directly access tax information from a secure IRS website. Look for this feature when completing your FAFSA online. The Simple Steps to Transfer your Tax Information into your FAFSA is a guide to using the IRS Data Retrival tool. Parents of dependent students will need to provide their income information and electronically sign the student's FAFSA or Dream Act Application. StudentAid.gov can help you determine your dependency status, which applies to both federal and state financial aid applications. For general information on financial aid at the University of California, view the Paying for UC video on YouTube. What to Expect After Filing your Financial Aid Application If you filed a FAFSA you will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) from the federal processor. To check the status of your application, visit fafsa.gov. If you filed a Dream Act Application, you will need to log in to dream.csac.ca.gov to view your SAR or to check the status of your application. Once completed you will receive an email confirmation, that you have successfully submitted your financial aid application.  The SAR provides you with an Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The Financial Aid Office will use the EFC to determine the types of aid you may receive. You can submit corrections to your application online through fafsa.gov or dream.csac.ca.gov. Students with a valid SAR will be directed to log in to MyAwards to view their personalized UC Davis aid package and requirements. First-year and Transfer students can access their information shortly after receiving admission notification. Continuing students will receive an email when their aid is available – typically by late April. Questions About Applying?
