By definition, annual funds are unrestricted, current-use funds that provide University leadership with maximum flexibility for responding quickly to new opportunities and to meet unexpected needs. Your gift to the CSUSM Annual Fund goes directly where it is needed most – to current students. Annual Fund gifts ensure that each year CSUSM is able to provide students with much needed financial aid, up to date technology, library resources, career counseling, academic support and more. Does my participation really matter? YES!  Organizations that rank U.S. colleges and universities look at alumni participation as an indicator of the quality of an institution.  In addition, many foundations and corporations look at alumni participation as a basis to determine wherever the College is a good investment.  Your gift, when combined with the other gifts from alumni and friends, adds up to big support for CSUSM students.  Your gift makes a statement that CSUSM is worth investing in. How much should I give to CSUSM’s Annual Fund?  Any gift, regardless of the size, is important. The collective giving of many is what makes the difference!  In fact, CSUSM is one of only 2 schools in the entire CSU system (23) whose giving by percentage of alumni has increased the last two years.  Whether an alum or not, growth of the Annual Fund makes a major impact on the campus and our students. I just graduated.  How am I supposed to give? Most Annual Fund donors are not making big salaries. Even those of us without large incomes can spare $25 a year. Again, this is about participation and expressing support for CSUSM, not about giving large gifts. May I make an Annual Fund gift in honor or in memory of someone? Yes. Gifts can be made to the Annual Fund in honor or in memory of a loved one, friend, or colleague. Please include the name of the individual you wish to honor in the space provided when you make your gift. Can I designate where my donation goes? Yes.  Your dollars can be unrestricted, allowing the President to use funds where she sees a need, or restricted to an account you specify, such as a specific college, department or Athletics. Is a gift to the Annual Fund tax deductible? Yes.  The CSUSM Foundation is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit and all gifts are tax deductible to the fullest extent of the law.
