Rather than isolating ourselves to one corner of the city, we take full advantage of the region. Five campus locations give students the convenience of attending class near work or home — even on the weekend. You can also access your education from home, via online learning.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Lincoln Park Campus ​Located on 36 acres in the heart of Chicago's historic Lincoln Park neighborhood, the Lincoln Park Campus is DePaul's largest and most active of the university's five campuses.​ Loop Campus ​In the heart of downtown, the Loop Campus features modern classrooms, high-tech student services, and expansive law and general libraries.​ Suburban Campuses DePaul's suburban campuses present a stimulating environment conducive for adult learning by way of graduate and undergraduate degree completion programs of study, and professional and continuing education certificates.​​​ In addition to the DePaul campuses listed above, a stand-alone Masters Entry to Nursing Program is offered at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in North Chicago, Illinois.​​​ FacebookLinkedInTwitter  DePaul University​ ​​1 E.
