UCR Biweekly Work-Study Timesheet Due Dates Student employees now submit electronic timesheets through UC's Time & Attendance Reporting System (TARS). Once the student completes their online electronic timesheet, they will print and submit it to their supervisor for final approval. Supervisors are required to submit approved student employee timesheets via email to workstudy@ucr.edu. Due to the very short timeframe financial aid staff has to process the approved timecards after they are submitted, it is important that approved timecards are received by the due dates in order to ensure that student employees are paid on time. Click here for a list of electronic timesheet due dates for the 2014-15 academic year. A step-by-step walkthrough of the process for electronic timesheet submission can be accessed here. 2014-15 Financial Aid Deadlines!

Financial Aid on Hold Information If you see that some or all of your financial aid on Growl Current Activity is “Aid on Hold”, you can click on the Growl “Holds” item on the menu bar for a description of the hold and how to resolve the hold (e.g., loan documents to be completed). Note: Aid on hold does not hold registration in courses. Once you have resolved the hold, allow at least a few business days to see the updated aid status on Growl.  Your aid will then appear as “Estimated Aid” until it is ready to “credit” your account.  After the quarter begins you may view any financial aid refunds or direct deposits that are issued to you for any credit balance on your student account after your charges have been paid. Please note that one financial aid award on hold will not necessarily prevent disbursement of other awards – for example, a loan on hold for completion of loan documents will not prevent the disbursement of a grant. It’s always a good idea to check Growl Current Activity for the latest information on your quarterly charges and aid credits, to check your latest account balance and to ensure that your aid is not on hold.
