The University is thrilled to host our first commencement ceremony in TDECU Stadium.  The new venue will allow us to achieve our goal of hosting a university-wide commencement ceremony and will unite the Cougar family in celebration of our accomplishments together.  This momentous occasion marks the beginning of many future graduation events in our stadium, and promises to deliver academic recognition, celebration, and tradition. Join me to salute the class of 2015 on May 15 at 7 p.m. Ticket information and details will be forthcoming soon.  Please save the date as we look forward to beginning new University of Houston traditions together!
