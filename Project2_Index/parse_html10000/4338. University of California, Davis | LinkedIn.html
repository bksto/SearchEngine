University of California, Davis UC Davis‬ is ranked 14th among large schools in producing Peace Corps volunteers! There are 41 Aggie alums currently serving abroad: http://bit.ly/1AoxA5W For Congressman John Garamendi, a Peace Corps alumnus, this comes as no surprise: “UC Davis instills in students a sense of purpose. It helps them develop skills to pursue their dreams. It is no surprise then that so many Aggies would join the Peace Corps where they can put these ideas into practice, where they can serve our nation by working with communities around the world." How did UC Davis prepare you to make a positive change in the world or in your community?

University of California, Davis It's that time of year again: love is in the air... and weddings are in the Arboretum! Mark and Julie Peet said their "I do's" last year near the Arboretum's turtle pond. With their anniversary fast approaching, the pair plans to revisit their wedding spot. Now, it's your turn: tell us where you met your sweetheart and we'll put you on the MAP! The love map, of course. Each Valentine's Day, we create a Google love map to celebrate the love that blossoms right here on the UC Davis campus. We've already told you Mark and Julie Peet's story; what's yours?

Our first date was a concert at Freedom Hall. 8 days ago Add a comment... Emilia (Varshavsky) Shapiro recommended this school: UCD: A Big School That You Can Make Your Own The four years I spent at UC Davis helped shape me as a personal and as a professional. Freshman year, someone told me, "Davis is huge, but you'll probably know someone in every one of your classes." And having been involved in many activities, that became very true. UC Davis has so many opportunities for students to DO something--whether it's a club or volunteer gig or on-campus job--that you can find out what you love outside the classroom. In the classroom, learning is non-stop. Whether you're in an intro lecture at Chem 194 or a discussion session in the basement of Wellman, you can expect to be surrounded by incredibly intelligent instructors and dedicated students. People LOVE UC Davis because it's full of nice people, who are willing to say hello and get to know you, yet are driven and can buckle down to study and get ahead. The UC Davis experience was phenomenal for me. From running the ASUCD Entertainment Council, to being a sister of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi sorority, to serving on the Jewish Student Union board, to living in the dorms (woo Bixby Hall!), I loved every minute of it. Every time I meet a fellow alum, we are able to bond and share our Aggie experiences.

My mom was a UC graduate and she said it was very laid back and all ag. 17 days ago Beverlee Couillard When I was at Davis, it was still a cow college, just beginning to grow. Graduated their first VETERINARIAN class. The Department of Food Technology was in their new building, and Dr. Mrak was head of that department; He eventually became the head of Davis. I worked there when not in classes or studying. 5 days ago Add a comment... University of California, Davis is here.
