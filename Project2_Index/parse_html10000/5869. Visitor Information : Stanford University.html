Prospective Students: Planning a Spring Visit? We strongly encourage prospective students planning a visit to do so either before March 14 or after April 7 in order to maximize the value of the visit. These are our busiest weeks of the year, and they coincide with Stanford's final exams and our own Spring Break — large crowds are thus paired with limited offerings and greatly reduced tour guide staffing. To truly get a sense of what Stanford is like, come during an academic quarter in order to sit in on classes, enjoy smaller tour groups, and take part in special interest tours and programs. For more information, please contact us at (650) 723-2560 during business hours. New to Stanford? Start Here!
