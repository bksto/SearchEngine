news tips pinner portraits pin picks Oh, How Pinteresting! news Start a conversation about a Pin 23 pinterest-tom news Wednesday, August 6, 2014 Start a conversation about a Pin Every day, people send more than two million Pins. Sending a Pin is a great way to let someone know you found something they’d love. We wanted to make it easier for you to have a good old fashioned conversation about those Pins. So now, when someone shoots you a Pin, you’ll be able to reply with a message or send a Pin back! More good news: you can also send Pins and messages to multiple people. Say you’re organizing a camping trip with friends—try sending Pins to the whole gang so you can figure out where to go and what meals to make. If you need a reminder of who’s bringing what, just pull up the conversation right from your notifications. We hope this will help you plan projects, swap creative ideas and share your best discoveries with each other. To learn more about sending and replying to Pins, see it in action. —Tom Watson, Product Designer, currently Pinning to Tiny archive The Pinterest Blog is brought to you from sunny California.
