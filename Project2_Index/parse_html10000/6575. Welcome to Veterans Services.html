We're here to assist you in a new mission - Earning a Degree. We help veterans and their dependents access the educational benefits they earned by serving in the armed forces of the United States. To do so, we certify their eligibility for the G.I. Bill and the CalVet Fee Waiver. Additionally, we provide veterans with information about applying for admissions to CSULB. The links on the left hand side of this page should guide you to most of the information you need to get started on the road to getting a degree from CSULB, so take some time reviewing the information we've put together for you. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or the Veterans Affairs Services staff. Dr. Marshall W.
