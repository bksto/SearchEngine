Some students begin looking at colleges early in their high school career, decide on their short list as a junior, write their essays in the summer before senior year, and have all of their applications submitted by October 15th. And if you listen to the news and the hype, that is the trajectory for all students. However, as with many things in life, everything is not as it appears. Maybe you want to focus on senior year, first semester courses, or maybe your SAT / ACT scores from senior year would serve to inform your choices, perhaps your family moved this summer or you were dealing with some other situation that required your full attention. Whatever the case, it is not too late! More than 50% of the Common Application colleges and universities have regular decision deadlines that are in March or later. Now is not the time to panic. There is still plenty of time to submit applications to college for the fall semester.  Go to the Common Application website to search for a list of colleges by application deadline.   Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Related ← Previous article Next article → Categories Admissions and Access Application College Counseling Essay Prompts Member Institutions Mission Statistics and Data Technology and Innovation In the spotlight Commitment to Increasing College Access The Common Application Board of Directors today approved a revised mission statement that will guide organizational priorities into the future.  Held at the fall meeting of the Board [...] ©2014 The Common Application | Blog at WordPress.com. | The MH Magazine Theme.
