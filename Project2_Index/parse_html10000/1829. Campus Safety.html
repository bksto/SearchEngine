In case of an emergency, those who have signed up and provided contact information will receive alerts from our Emergency Notification system. Risk Management & Safety provides the expertise for occupational and environmental safety, as well as provides guidance and instruction on how to keep a safe campus environment for our students, faculty and staff. In addition, the Women's Center offers workshops on sexual assault, relationship abuse, and gender violence for the CSUSM community. What is the Clery Report?
