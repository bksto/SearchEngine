Meet Peter the Anteater, celebrity mascot of UC Irvine. Here’s where you’ll learn all about the anteater – his history, his habitat, his habits. Follow Peter’s bristly tail as he trots the globe and beyond. He’s been everywhere – the White House (where he posed with President Bush); the State Capitol Building where he visited Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s office; the College World Series; and even outer space, hitching a ride aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. Inspired by Johnny Hart’s “B.C.” comic strip, Peter the Anteater remains, if not the most unusual college mascot, at least the one with the longest tongue. Zot! Mascot Makeovers No doubt about it: Peter the Anteater is the face of UCI. And what a face it is! Over the years, the mascot's had multiple makeovers, moving from cuddly oversize fur ball to the tough, buff anteater with biceps he is today.
