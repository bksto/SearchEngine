Obsolete Retail and Adaptive Reuse In Fall 2014, the INAR 4500 Interior Architecture studio examined retail change and suburban shopping malls in the mid-continental United States. Beginning in Laredo at the international border along I-35, dead malls reveal on-going changes in production and consumption—a retail landscape built for 1970s suburban homogeneity has become increasingly multicultural and hybridized. As a design-research intensive studio, the semester began with the documentation and analysis of under-performing malls along the I-35 and I-45 interstate corridors. Students identified sites for adaptive intervention, engaging social, cultural, and ecological parameters to reconsider these obsolete suburban 'infrastructures' through radical transformation. The Highland Mall opened in 1971 as Austin's first enclosed mall. Since that time, it began to lose popularity by the 1990s and has become virtually abandoned. Although the mall has lost considerable retail activity and awaits redevelopment, it has increasingly become more attractive to bird migration. The Purple Martin uses Highland Mall as a nesting ground from July through early September when thousands of birds descend upon the rooftop and parking field. Through this process, Highland Mall has become an unlikely bird sanctuary, attracting urban bird-watchers from the Austin metropolitan area and beyond. This project, 'Labyrinthian Lattice', proposes the radical redevelopment of Highland Mall through its adaptive reuse into a regional bird sanctuary, aviary, wildlife educational facility. and veterinarian clinic. The proposal engages building obsolescence and programmatic migration to redesign Highland Mall into a porous 'building-landscape' supporting wildlife within an urban context.

October 7, 2014 Fall Lecture Series with Tomohiko Yamanashi Through Japanese architectural works designed by NIKKEN SEKKEI, this lecture tries to show you how to use BIM to realize high quality design based on the concept of mass-customization, not based on 20th century concept of mass-production.

Hines College of Architecture receives Invitation to Exhibit 3 Con Houston, Texas – The University of Houston’s Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture has received an invitation to attend and exhibit the 3 Continents Studio project at the 2014 Venice Biennale.  On February 18, 2014, Dean Patricia Oliver received the invitation for the 3 Continents Studio to travel to Venice to exhibit their work along with their architectural partners from University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Technical University, Delft, The Netherlands,  Tulane University, New Orleans and visiting faculty Michael Rotundi. The Three Continents Studio’s invitation to appear in the Venice Biennale marks the 3rd Biennale appearance for “Risky Habit [at]: Dynamic Living on a Delta” in 2013-2014.  The 3 Continents Studio has attended the Buenos Aries Biennale and will be attending the Rotterdam Biennale in May 2014.  This is the first time that the Gerald D Hines College of Architecture has been invited to attend the Venice Biennale. Over 200,000 visitors will be able to view the work of the University of Houston Students and faculty. Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture Dean Patricia Oliver said, “This accomplishment has been a two year journey with the collaboration of four different international institutions across three different continents. The College is taking a leadership role in tackling urban issues on a global scale.” The Three Continents Studio was created for architecture students to explore how Houston, the fourth largest city with one of the busiest shipping ports in the United States adjacent to the fourth largest estuary in the United States, could develop compatible strategies for an industrialized, urban city on the water’s edge. “Fifty Percent of the world’s population lives on deltas’. These students used Houston’s ship channel as an example of delta issues and produced very compelling solutions that can be utilized by urban areas across the world” , stated professor Peter Zweig who led the students involved in 3 Continents. This year’s Venice Biennale is directed by Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement recipient in 2010 and Pritzker Prize recipient in 2000, Rem Koolhaas.  The Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture team will share their palazzo with Pritzker Prize winners Richard Rogers, Eduardo Souto de Moura, Ricardo Bofill, and architectural notable Marlin Blackwell FAIA.
