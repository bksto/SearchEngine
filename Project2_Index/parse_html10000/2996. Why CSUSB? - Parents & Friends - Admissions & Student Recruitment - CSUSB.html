We are a medium-sized university featuring a contemporary setting, small classes, modern and well-equipped labs and facilities, strong support services and close faculty contact. Some of San Bernardino County’s brightest high school graduates have made CSUSB their university of choice, thanks in part to our renewable President’s Academic Excellence Scholarship (PAES). Students who have ranked in the top 1 percent of their class are personally invited to attend our institution. Several of these students have already taken advantage of the treasure found in their own backyard. A similar opportunity has been extended to the top 2 percent of graduates from Riverside and San Bernardino counties through the Mathematics and Science Scholars (MASS) Program. Local students who are interested in pursuing baccalaureate degrees in the fields of mathematics, biology, computer science, chemistry, physics or geology are encouraged to apply to Cal State San Bernardino and benefit from scholarship awards and a rewarding educational experience.   Cal State San Bernardino offers effective support services and faculty guidance that are necessary tools to help students reach their educational and career goals. Faculty, staff and current CSUSB students all help new students stay focused and find their way. Assistance begins in the Office of Admissions and Student Recruitment, and then continues through the likes of Advising and Academic Services; EOP; faculty advisors; Financial Aid; the Learning Center; Office of The Registrar; SAIL; and Student Leadership and Development. The list goes on and on. Cal State San Bernardino seeks to keep the doors open to students and help them survive the obstacles that are sure to come. The Educational Opportunity Program in particular is designed to improve access and retention of historically low-income and educationally disadvantaged students. EOP students have the potential and demonstrated motivation to perform satisfactorily at a CSU, but they have not been able to realize their full potential because of their economic or educational background. The program provides admission, academic and financial assistance to EOP-eligible undergraduate students. You will find that our entire staff is ready and able to assist you and your student as you continue to explore CSUSB. Discover that we are the best choice for your student, too.   Disability Resources  |  Privacy & Security Notice  |  The California State University System  |  Contact Admissions California State University, San Bernardino Office of Admissions & Student Recruitment 5500 University Parkway, San Bernardino, CA 92407 p-909.537.5188 f-909.537.7034 updated February 5, 2015 Contact Webmaster download adobe reader
