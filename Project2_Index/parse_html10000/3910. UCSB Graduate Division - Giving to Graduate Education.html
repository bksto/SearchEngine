UCSB enables our students to approach problems creatively, to forge connections that advance fields of thought, and to apply what they’ve learned to tackle some of the world’s most pressing problems. Our students evolve into leaders in academia, industry, government, education, non-profits, and the arts. Providing graduate students with a world-class education is a costly endeavor. Donations can help UCSB provide dazzling recruitment packages that will attract the world’s top graduate applicants. The funds can also be earmarked for graduate student research. Gifts to the Graduate Division at UCSB Here are some examples of how your gifts can directly support UCSB’s most accomplished and innovative graduate students: Gifts of $100 or less Gifts of $100 or less are often pooled with similar contributions to fund a conference grant, enabling a graduate student to present his or her research findings at a gathering of scholars, receive feedback from colleagues, connect with peers, and lay the groundwork for future collaborative projects. Gift of $3,000 A gift of $3,000 can enable a graduate student to conduct research at a distant location. We have had students study the impact of climate change in Antarctica, fault lines in the Himalayas, endangered languages in Papua New Guinea, the educational system in Finland, and coffee plantations in South America, to name just a few. Gift of $8,000 A gift of $8,000 can provide a Summer Research Grant to a doctoral student who collaborates with a faculty member on a research project during the Summer term. Awards are based on the quality, significance and creativity of the proposed project, the achievement and potential of the faculty applicant, the intellectual role of the student, and the commitment of the faculty member to provide significant mentoring. Donors are welcome to attend final student presentations in the fall. Gift of $25,000 A gift of $25,000 can fund a dissertation fellowship. Designated for doctoral students engaged in innovative scholarship, this stipend will make it possible for a Ph.D. candidate to focus on completing his or her thesis. The Graduate Division often matches dissertation fellowship gifts by paying fees and health insurance. Endowed gift of $100,000 An endowed gift of $100,000 can establish a named fund to provide research grants for master’s and doctoral students in perpetuity. This legacy gift will build a solid academic foundation for the future, enriching the educational experience of tomorrow’s graduate students by extending their potential for high-impact research. Endowed gift of $250,000 An endowed gift of $250,000 can establish a named fund to annually support a partial fellowship to a doctoral student who is completing his or her dissertation. Endowed gift of $750,000 An endowed gift of $750,000 can establish a fund to provide an annual named full fellowship for a UCSB master’s or doctoral student. Endowed named fellowships are used to recruit the most promising graduate students, those who show evidence of making exceptional contributions to their fields. Bequest A bequest made through an estate plan will help graduate students of the future address challenges and study issues that emerge as the world continues on its rapid trajectory of change.
