Andrea Cho “Hi Bobcats! My name is Andrea Cho and I am in Junior standing for this upcoming Fall 2013-2014 semester. I will graduate with a B.A. in Literature and Cultures and progress my way toward Law School. I am on the executive board of the Korean American Coalition Club and actually plan to join in on a lot more clubs that UC Merced has to offer. Want to know one random fun fact? I recently just switched from an iPhone 4 to a Samsung S4 recently…it is a struggle. Favorite color? Ranges when the seasons change! A favorite recent memory would be when I went bungee jumping off a mountain in China, and also bonding with my relatives in Korea. Also, if you see me walking anywhere, I will always have headphones on because I am a music fanatic! One last thing I would like to say is that UC Merced has opened a lot of doors for me. Not only through education but also toward personal decisions in my life. This University has helped me develop into a person my family, friends, and myself are very proud of. Thank you UC MERCED!” "Hello Hello! My name is Brenda Sanchez. I am a first year here at UC Merced, Class of 2017! I am actually a Merced native, majoring in Psychology with a minor in Public Health. I am secretary of Bobcat STUNT, a cheerleading club here on campus that I love! Sunny weather, puppies, music, Chinese food, and chocolate make me happy! Big on adventure and trying new things. So far my first year here at UC Merced has been amazing due to all the new opportunities I have been given just by attending. I'm happy here at UC Merced, and at the SFC, I can not wait to see how much this University grows during my academic career here.  Oh, and I may or may not be addicted to social media, ESPECIALLY Twitter.

GO BOBCATS!  My name is Cristian Cisneros. I am a second year Spanish major. I enjoy music and art more than anything else. I am currently a father to a Chihuahua mix that I love very much. I am an aspiring cook; currently working on making the best PB&J possible in time for National PB&J Day. I was born in Mexico and came to the United States when I was 8 years old and have lived in Atwater since then. Fun fact about me: I read all the “Goosebumps” books that were available in my school library in 5th grade. I watch at least 1 documentary on wild life per week. I hope to one-day make a difference in people’s lives, but for now stop by the SFC and say hello!    Cristian Cisneros Daniela Portillo Hello fellow humans. Welcome to the Students First Center website. Let me just take a moment of your oh so lovely time to tell you a little about myself. I'm from San Jose. I am majoring in Psychology and Minoring in Art. I hope to one day work as a Art Therapist. I really enjoy art and photography. I am a travel enthusiast! I hope to one day be able to travel the world. Fingers crossed!! I don't have a favorite color, however, I do have some favorite foods. Pizza, tacos and donuts!! I could eat that all day, everyday!​ I am currently a proud owner of a cactus named Don Carlos. I like to believe that I am a very outgoing person, so if you happen to see me making a fool of myself around campus, don't hesitate to say hi! Can't wait to meet you!
