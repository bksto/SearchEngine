The department is indeed built around a 9 story high precipitation shaft used by Hans Pruppacher to study the growth of water drops. Today the Atmospheric Physics and Chemistry program consists of six nationally and internationally recognized faculty who work together with a number of researchers and graduate students. The research areas cover many of todays most pressing environmental problems. The investigation of chemical processes in the atmosphere will advance the understanding the formation of the stratospheric ozone hole and smog in urban areas. The genesis and growths of aerosol and cloud particles, as well as their interaction with atmospheric radiation is one of the most uncertain aspects of the global climate and the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. The research activities range from computer modeling, through experiments in various laboratories. to field measurements and satellite observations. The program is subdivided into the following categories Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Pollution Atmospheric Radiation Aerosol and Cloud Physics Remote Sensing Biogeochemical cycles Affiliated Faculty Professor Annmarie Eldering Professor Randall Friedl Professor Jasper Kok Professor Qinbin Li Professor Kuo Nan Liou Professor Suzanne Paulson Professor Ulli Seibt Professor Jochen Stutz Professor Emeritus Richard Turco Professor Aradhna Tripati Affiliated Researchers Yu Gu Steve Hurlock Jinwon Kim S.
