In support of this commitment, Congress established a series of programs to help low-income Americans enter college, graduate and move on to participate more fully in America 's economic and social life. These Programs are funded under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and are referred to as the TRIO Programs (initially just three programs). While student financial aid programs help students overcome financial barriers to higher education, TRIO programs help students overcome class, social and cultural barriers to higher education. History The Office for Students with Disabilities was awarded its fourth TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) five year grant through the US Department of Education national competition in 2010-2015. The Grant will focus on assisting students with disabilities, low income and first generation students. They will be supported with tutor/advisors for improving term paper writing and library research skills, academic advising, personal counseling, computer workshops, information/referrals, computer lab access, and various workshops. In addition, selected students will be provided incentive stipends to participate in academically related improvement activities. Overall the TRIO SSS program intends to enhance student’s retention and ultimately graduate from CSULA.
