Nicolás Hewgley started as a biology major, but soon after his arrival, migrated to theatre. There, with the support of his professors, he flourished. Now he is considering a career in the arts. Nicolás Hewgley is involved in VOX Musical Theatre and the WPI Men’s Glee Club. “My full name is Nicolás Rogelio Hewgley,” he says. “My friends and family call me Nico. I am from San Antonio, Texas, and I am of Mexican descent. I am a senior studying Humanities and Arts with a concentration in Drama/Theatre. I am heavily involved in the arts on campus, specifically VOX Musical Theatre and the WPI Men’s Glee Club. I am also involved with the fraternity Alpha Chi Rho. “Nicolás is the 21st century Renaissance man.” – Director of choral music John Delorey For this interview, Hewgley sat in Professor John Delorey’s office in Alden Hall. It was a cold day in February and Nico kept his coat on. It was a colorful sport jacket with what appeared to be an emblem or insignia from a school in the Longhorn state. “I am originally from Texas and currently applying for MFA programs in theatre there,” he said. “My background in theatre started in high school. Like most children I did participate in the annual Christmas plays in elementary and middle school, but my spark and passion for theatre began my sophomore year of high school. Since then, I have been involved with 36 independent productions either at WPI or in my hometown community of San Antonio in various roles ranging from technical crew member to director.” Hewgley is preparing for the upcoming New Voices Festival. Hewgley’s boyish good looks belie his upperclassman status. However, his quiet demeanor reveals an even-tempered senior ready to take on the world. He is focused and enthusiastic. Not anxious. His quiet countenance gives him an air of confidence—someone in control of his destiny and excited about the future.“I started my collegiate theatre career during the Masque fall production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof as a front of house usher. From that experience I immersed myself into the theatre community and I have held many roles here at WPI, including house manager, assistant producer, and director.” Hewgley’s hard work has not gone unnoticed. “Nicolás is the 21st century Renaissance man,” says Delorey. “He is a conductor, director, actor, singer, and technical wizard all brought together in an exceptionally talented and hard-working undergrad who has impacted so many facets of student life at WPI.” Director and choreographer Kristy Chambrelli, who has worked with Hewgley on a series of Masque productions, says, “Nicolàs is an extremely hard working student and is always trying to discover more about himself as an artist and about his craft. He has the potential to become a great director and the drive to succeed in this business.” Directing style Currently preparing for the upcoming New Voices Festival, Hewgley talked about his directing style. “It is based on character development—I hold my actors to a high standard. I see theatre here at WPI as a job, one that requires many hours of work in order to achieve the level of performance needed.” Chambrelli and Hewgley share a mutual admiration for one another. He says her mentorship and example has given him the assurance that there is a career waiting for him in the arts. She says, “Nick did an internship last summer at a theatre in Texas. He asked me, ‘What were some of the most important things to learn while he was there?’ I told him that learning more about technical theatre will make you a more effective director and help you work with your designers. Nick took me really seriously and now even knows how to weld, something he is very proud of. He is the owner of masterwelders@wpi.edu. If you need something welded, Nick is your man.” When asked about Hewgley’s contributions to VOX, Masque, and theatre in general at the school, Chambrelli says, “Nick is graduating, which is a big loss for musical theatre at WPI. We don’t have any projects planned as of now, but I am sure he will work as an assistant for me in the future.” - By David Sneade Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
