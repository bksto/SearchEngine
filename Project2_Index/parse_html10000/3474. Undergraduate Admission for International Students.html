Alexander Human Biology "You don’t have to be a science major; you don’t have to be any particular major. Every single major has some sort of research initiative, and it’s all very exciting, and the school really promotes that sort of environment." David Artis Dean of Undergraduate Research Initiatives "Research is a great leveler. If you’ve got a really good idea, it doesn’t much matter that you’re a first-year student, or a first-generation student whose family didn’t go to college. The quality of your work speaks louder than anything else. If you’re a smart student and doing good research, you’re going to get a lot of affirmation and support."
