WPI policy is that this training is required for all first-time graduate Teaching Assistants, regardless of prior teaching experience. The next offering will be held on two partial days: Tuesday and Wednesday, January 13-14. One element of the training is WPI's online harassment prevention course, which can be accessed from the link below. TAs are encouraged to start this online training before the TA Training Seminar; it must be completed by the first day of the term of the initial appointment.

Certificate in College Teaching The Certificate in College Teaching (CCT) program, operated by the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts (HECCMA), offers formal preparation in teaching for graduate students and faculty. It is based upon the premise that effective preparation for the college classroom involves more than a solid base of knowledge in a discipline; it requires a systematic inquiry into the pedagogies and processes that facilitate learning. The 2-credit Seminar in College Teaching provides an excellent overview of basic principles and theories of education and instructional practice that apply across numerous disciplines. The Seminar can be taken alone without intention of pursuing a certificate, or students may proceed with additional courses to earn the 6-credit certificate. Courses are offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters. For details on course offerings and schedules, go to the Certificate in College Teaching website. Tuition assistance for CCT courses is available for WPI graduate students.         See Also Harassment Prevention Training English as a Second Language Tuition Assistance for Certificate in College Teaching Courses Useful Links for TAs & TA Supervisors Developing Strong TA/Supervisor Relationships (University of Minnesota) Guiding, Training, and Supervising Teaching Assistants (U.C.
