UMass Amherst ranks among the top 30 public universities in the nation. Since the fall of 2005, undergraduate applications to UMass Amherst have increased eighty-four percent, with each entering class setting a new record as the highest academically achieving students in the history of the campus. With new campus facilities opening over the past few years – including the Commonwealth Honors College Residential Community, the Integrative Learning Center, the Integrated Sciences Building, and the Life Science Laboratories – our faculty and students have access to a research and learning environment that is cutting edge by any standard. In addition to educating the next generation of Commonwealth citizens, we are also a research powerhouse that touches – and often transforms – communities in the state and around the world. Our research expenditures totaled $190.7 million in Fiscal Year 2013. In addition, UMass Amherst is one of only five “Research 1” universities in Massachusetts, the highest designation attainable – and the only public institution on the list. And among all Massachusetts universities – public and private – UMass Amherst is the third largest recipient of research funding from the National Science Foundation. To continue building on our remarkable record of success, we have embarked upon a comprehensive campus-wide strategic planning process. As part of this plan, UMass Rising, the largest campaign in the history of the campus, continues to work towards its goal of $300 million.   I am proud to lead the flagship campus of the Commonwealth during one of the most exciting times in our history.
