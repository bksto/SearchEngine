Support Redlands University of Redlands > Support Redlands > Profiles of Philanthropy Profiles of Philanthropy "Profiles of Philanthropy" is one way we share stories of generous donors from all ages and walks of life who are linked together in their support and investment of Redlands. Not every donor story is about the extraordinarily large gift.  Some stories are about loyalty, others are about meeting specific philanthropic goals and still others are about leaving a legacy for generations of future students to enjoy. Our profiles are always evolving and changing. Maybe you will be featured someday as you discern the University of Redlands' place in your own philanthropic dreams. Today. Tomorrow. Forever.
