The Friends are devoted to enhancing learning and research at the University of Arizona by raising money to expand the services and collections of the University Libraries. Friends regularly support the purchase of special and rare items for Special Collections, new online databases and journals, new technology, and furniture.

The Friends accept books all year round (no journals please). Most donations will go towards the periodic book sales, the proceeds of which will be used to purchase important materials for the University of Arizona Libraries' collections. Donations may be tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law. Please note that we are unable to provide an appraisal of book donations.

Library collections endowments are a unique opportunity, compared to other types of endowments, because they provide a tangible and constantly growing contribution to the university. The positive effects of each endowment begin immediately and are cumulative over time as both the balance grows and the number of items purchased increases.

Planned gifts are commitments made by you today but are not actually realized by the University Libraries until some future date. They range from simple agreements to complex trust arrangements and will be designated to benefit the Libraries. Some offer an income for life and they all provide income tax and estate tax benefits.
