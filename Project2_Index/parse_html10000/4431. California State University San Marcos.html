Meet the CSU admissions eligibility index based upon GPA in college preparatory classes and scores from the ACT or SAT Reasoning exam.

Courses not listed above will be excluded from the GPA calculation. The Eligibility Index is a combination of the high school GPA and that score on either the ACT or the SAT Reasoning exam, excluding the writing subscore. Calculate the eligibility index by either: SAT: multiplying your GPA by 800 and adding your total SAT scores for Critical Reading and Mathematics or ACT: multiplying your GPA by 200 and adding 10 times your ACT Composite score. The minimum eligibility index is 2900 (with SAT) or 694 (with ACT) for California residents. The minimum eligibility for non-residents is 3502 (with SAT) or 842 (with ACT).  To assist you in determining your eligibility, you can find an eligibility calculator online at CSU Mentor.
