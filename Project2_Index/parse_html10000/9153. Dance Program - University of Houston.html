Dance at the University of Houston strives to create confidence in the student through both the disciplined practice of dance and the transferable skills of creative interaction with others. Our mission is to assist individuals in defining their own originality through dance, to develop curious minds, and to prepare students with the life skills of critical thinking and inventive problem solving. We are committed to providing a center for dance in metropolitan Houston through workshops, collaboration, performances, and through projects by the Center for Choreography.

To analyze movement within the contexts of tradition, history, art, music, and dance theory. A Human Interaction Component:To balance individual thinking with collective collaboration, and develop individuals who are able to effectively work with others to realize their potential in dance and in life.
