The contribution of research to advances in the knowledge base can be directly applied to patient care, and a key component of the education of NYUCD students lies in understanding how research contributes to this knowledge. Further, research as a career option is best demonstrated through the recognition of research as a prominent part of the activity of the faculty. In addition to the integration of research endeavors in the predoctoral program, there are three research-focused academic programs at NYUCD: MS in Biomaterials, MS in Clinical Research, and MS in Oral Biology. NYU College of Dentistry has one of the largest and most rapidly growing research programs in the country, and one of the most successful in terms of attracting federal funding. An important part of NYUCD's research strategy is translational research. We firmly believe that in today's world, groups of researchers must work together synergistically in order to move fundamental basic science research into practice. This integrated approach drives the majority of the research conducted today at the NYU College of Dentistry. Office of Research The Office of Research provides advice on grant proposals, seeks new sources of funding for research, and counsels faculty and students on research opportunities. The Office of Research oversees the review of research proposals within the college and sponsors small grants for both faculty and student research. Our Goals Identify research priorities and opportunities Promote the quality of research Provide support for development of research grants Encourage wider faculty involvement in research Develop seminars to encourage research Contact Louis Terracio, Vice Dean for Research (212) 998-9917 Maria DeAcetis, Administrator (212) 998-9219        Resources & Forms for Researchers: Human Subjects Research NYUCD Forms Sub Navigation Faculty Research Research Centers at NYUCD Global Research Collaborations Student Research shared scientific core resourcesRead More         NYUCD/NYUCN Annual Research DaysRead More RESEARCH CENTERS AT NYU COLLEGE OF DENTISTRY Bluestone Center for Clinical Research An academic Contract Research Organization (CRO), Bluestone conducts biomedical research on pharmaceuticals, devices, emerging biotechnology, and oral health products.
