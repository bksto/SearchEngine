The Rape Aggression Defense (R.A.D.) System is a program of realistic, self-defense tactics and techniques. It is a comprehensive course for women that begin with awareness, prevention, risk reduction and avoidance, while progressing on to the basics of hands-on defense training. R.A.D. is not a martial arts program. Our courses are taught by certified R.A.D. instructors and provide you with a workbook/reference manual. This manual outlines the entire physical defense program for reference and continuous personal growth. The R.A.D. System of Physical Defense is currently being taught at many colleges and Universities. The growing widespread acceptance of this system is primarily due to the ease, simplicity and effectiveness of our tactics, solid research and unique teaching methodology. The R.A.D. Systems is dedicated to teaching women defensive concepts and techniques against various types of assault, by utilizing easy, effective and proven self-defense tactics. Our system of realistic defense will provide a woman with the knowledge to make an educated decision about resistance. R.A.D. Objectives To develop and enhance the options of self-defense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked. Somewhere in America, a woman is sexually assaulted every two minutes, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Approximately 68 percent of rape victims knew their assailant. [Violence against women. Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Dept of Justice, 1994] Safety and survival in today’s world requires a definite course of action. We provide effective options by teaching women to take an active role in their own self-defense and psychological well-being. R.A.D. Course Description 12-hour basic physical defense class Session 1 Utilizing the R.A.D. student manual, students will be involved in a discussion of risk reduction strategies, date rape, continuum of survival, defensive strategies and the basic principles of defense. We also discuss the pros and cons of defensive weaponry how to develop a defensive mind set, understanding offensive and defensive postures, recognizing vulnerable locations and utilizing personal weapons. Session 2 Participating students will begin the process of hands-on training. The techniques utilized by R.A.D. Systems are based on simple gross motor skill and are developed to the point that they become instinctual through repetition. Students will have the opportunity to use these techniques in dynamic impact training by striking padded equipment held by the instructors. All techniques target a single attacker. Session 3 Participating students will continue to refine the skills previously learned with “practice, practice and practice.” Session 4 Students will then participate in “simulated assault” scenarios with R.A.D. instructors, who along with participants, wear state-of-the-art protective gear specifically designed for this training. Women have the opportunity to utilize their skills in a safe training environment. Home University Police Rape Aggression Defense Upcoming Courses All of our R.A.D. courses are free.
