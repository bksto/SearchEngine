Worcester Polytechnic Institute About WPI Academics Admissions Research Campus Life Athletics Skip to Additional Navigation Home  > Academics > Undergraduate Studies Undergraduate Studies At WPI, project-based learning is embedded in every aspect of study, preparing our graduates to make the most of their knowledge, initiative, and ideas. We keep terms short and classes small. The study is more intense, but so is the support to help you succeed. Science and engineering may be notoriously tough to master, but far back in our history we decided that a failing grade is as much a failure on our part as the student’s. We want you to branch out, cross disciplines, and experiment. From our award-winning title="First Year Experience">first year programs, to the low student-to-faculty ratio (14:1), you will not get lost in the crowd here. Departments & Areas of Study WPI students pursue bachelor’s, master’s, and Ph.D. degrees in more than 50 disciplines. Check out our areas of study, department, and programs. > Student Reflections View Additional Videos   See Also Academic Assistance Career Development Center Course Catalogs Student Life Student Organizations Request Info Here you will learn to apply knowledge to real problems, whether that means curing a disease or designing a humanoid robot. You’ll also be immersed in the humanities and arts, and be required to explore the interface between technology and society. — Art Heinricher Dean, Undergraduate Studies Academics Undergraduate Studies About Us Project-Based Learning Undergraduate Research Departments & Areas of Study Summer Sessions Student Awards Program Assessment Related Sites Celebrating Graduate Research Campus Life Office of Multicultural Affairs Student Development and Counseling Center WPI Bookstore Contact Undergraduate Studies Office of the Provost 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5222 Fax: +1-508-831-5774 provost@wpi.edu Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
