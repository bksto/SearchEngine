The student must sign the form and mail it to the Registrar's Office, 1501 W Bradley Avenue, Peoria, IL 61625 with a check for $25.00 or credit card information. Replacement diplomas are signed by the current President and Chairman of the Board and have the Bradley University seal. If you want the diploma or a copy of your diploma to be signed by the Registrar and notarized, please add a statement to that effect somewhere on the form. The fee to certify a diploma or transcript is $7.00. If you want the diploma to also include an Apostille, you must include a separate letter addressed to the Illinois Secretary of State requesting an Apostille on the document (diploma, transcript or both), stating to which country the Apostille will be sent. Also include a check or money order made payable to the Illinois Secretary of State including $2.00 for each document needing an Apostille. Include a self-addressed, postage paid envelope with your request to the Secretary of State so that they may mail the form directly to you or your representative.
