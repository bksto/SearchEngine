Ultimately, I want to serve as liaison between farmers and government so I can ensure that my nation’s voice is heard and decisions are made in favor of agriculture,” she said. Kaur is a student at the College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences and is one of the first Central Valley Scholars—a new program between UC Davis and Central Valley businesses that provides a comprehensive approach of scholarships, internships, mentoring, and networking to encourage graduates to choose Central Valley careers. Kaur’s passion to attend UC Davis—a school that she felt strongly was the “best choice” for a career in agriculture—may not have been realized without philanthropic efforts found in programs like Central Valley Scholars, which was created to expose students to the vast career opportunities in the Central Valley. She is also taking advantage of the Central Valley Scholars internship opportunities at the Department of Plant Sciences as well as the UC Davis Dairy Facility. “There is so much to discover in this field that would help our future,” said Kaur, who is minoring in international agriculture development so she can help underdeveloped countries conduct crop research. “I think we’re here to help each other.  Mother Teresa said she could not change the world but could cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples,” she said. "The Central Valley Scholarship has blessed me with the same power, which will help me create ripples across the world of agriculture.”   Copyright © The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus.
