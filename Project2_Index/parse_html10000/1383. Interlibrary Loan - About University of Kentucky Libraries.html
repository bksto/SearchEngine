If the collection lacks items needed for research, University of Kentucky faculty, emeritus faculty, students, and staff may be able to obtain loans or reproductions of the articles needed for their research. The ILL staff will attempt to obtain the material from another library or document vendor. Three ILL departments are available to help UK Researchers.
