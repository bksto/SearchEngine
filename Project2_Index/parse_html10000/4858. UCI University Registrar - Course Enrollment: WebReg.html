Refer to in the Quarterly Academic Calendar to view these periods. NOTE: After these periods, to add, drop, or change, you must submit an Enrollment Exception Request through the Applications section in StudentAccess. Add, drop, and change deadlines are available in the Quarter Activity section of the Quarterly Academic Calendar. WebReg is available from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. daily, with occasional downtime for maintenance. During the Enrollment by Window period, when your enrollment window opens, you have 48 hours of full access before you are restricted to non-prime time access (7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), while other students' enrollment windows open on an established priority basis. Continuing Students: To find your enrollment window, visit StudentAccess beginning the seventh week of the current quarter. Once logged in to WebReg, you will be able to: Add a class (through 2nd week of instruction) Drop a class (through 2nd week of instruction) Change the grading option of a class (through 2nd week of instruction) Change the unit value of a variable unit course (through 2nd week of instruction) Use the waitlist option until waitlists are deactivated View co-classes List the open sections of selected classes Receive confirmation of successful enrollment transactions Receive error messages for unsuccessful attempts to add, drop, or change enrollment Be notified of any academic holds on your record Verify your registration fee status Co-Classes If the lecture class you are tentatively enrolled in requires a co-class, you must successfully add the co-class during the same enrollment session, or you will be dropped from the tentatively enrolled section. If all discussions are full, no one will be allowed to enroll in or waitlist the lecture. Unit Limits for Undergraduate Students (20 units vs. 18 units) As an undergraduate, you may enroll in as few as 12.0 units or as many as 20.0 units per quarter. However, undergraduate enrollment will be limited to 18.0 units until WebReg reopens after the fee payment deadline. Refer to the Quarterly Academic Calendar to view the date when the 18.0 unit limit is lifted to 20.0 units. Prior to the lifting of the 18.0 unit limit, undergraduate students with a documented need to enroll in more than 18.0 units should contact their Academic Advising Office for assistance. After the lifting of the 18.0 unit limit, students must obtain the authorization of their dean if enrolling in more than 20 (20.1) units or enrolling in fewer than 12 units. Students with an undecided/undeclared major require the approval of the Dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education. The unit maximum includes units from classes you have waitlisted. Therefore, the total units combined between enrolled and waitlisted classes must not exceed the current limit of either 18 or 20 units. Units from your waitlisted classes will not count toward the Minimum Required Units (MRU) for Financial Aid recipients. Units from your waitlisted classes will not be counted when verifying your total enrolled units, because you are not officially enrolled in a waitlisted class. The official Regulation 445 regarding the Enrollment Unit Limitation is available on the UCI Academic Senate website. Unit Limits for Graduate Students (16 units) As a graduate student, full-time academic enrollment is expected at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. You may enroll in lower-division courses with the approval of your academic advisor, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Ordinarily, you may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in combination. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by your Graduate Advisor. The 16 unit maximum includes units from classes you have waitlisted. Therefore, the total units combined between enrolled and waitlisted must not exceed 16 units. Units from your waitlisted classes will not count toward the Minimum Required Units (MRU) for Financial/Graduate Aid recipients. Units from your waitlisted classes will not be counted when verifying your total enrolled units, because you are not officially enrolled in a waitlisted class. Course Restriction Codes Course restrictions are determined and placed by the department offering the course. When and if a restriction is removed, is also determined by the department offering the course. Therefore, courses may continue to be restricted throughout all enrollment periods. Questions regarding restriction codes placed on a course should be directed to the department offering the course. Existing restrictions are identified in the Rstr column of the Schedule of Classes (SOC). Refer to our list of Course Restriction Codes for detailed descriptions of the various restriction codes. Course Status The status of a course indicates the seat availability in that particular course. The status may be found in the Status column of the Schedule of Classes (SOC). Listed below are the 4 possible course statuses and their definitions. OPEN—Course has seats available. FULL—Course has no seats available; the waitlist has no seats available (if active). Waitl—Course has no seats available; seats are available on the waitlist. NewOnly—The department that offers this course has reserved seats for new students. A New Student is a freshman or transfer student enrolling in their first term at UCI. The number of seats reserved for new students is indicated in the Nor (New Only Reserved) column of the Schedule of Classes. Late Enrollment You must enroll in classes before the end of the second week of instruction. You will be assessed a $50 late enrollment charge if you are enrolled in zero units or enroll after the end of the second week of instruction. Failing to enroll in classes by the end of the third week of instruction will cause you to lose your student status. Loss of Student Status The final deadline for paying tuition and fees late and/or enrolling late is Friday, 4:30 p.m. at the end of the third week of instruction. Failing to pay tuition and fees and enroll by this final deadline will result in the loss of student status. Academic Holds Some academic holds prevent enrollment in classes. If you have an academic hold on your record, immediately contact the office that placed the hold. Classes are dropped if a hold remains on your record at 5:00 p.m. on the fee payment deadline. UCInetID A UCInetID and password is required to use WebReg. You may activate your UCInetID through the Office of Information Technology website. (OIT) University offices and faculty use email to communicate with students. This is frequently the preferred means to communicate official notices regarding students status and important class information. Remember to check your email daily as your mailbox can fill quickly during the first two weeks of a quarter. A full mailbox will prevent the delivery of new messages. You may set a delivery point that is different than your UCI email so that you do not miss important announcements.   Access WebReg Video Tutorial: YouTube | MP4 File Helpful Tools Schedule of Classes Check class availability and search for classes that satisfy Breadth and General Education requirements.
