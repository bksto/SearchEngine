Visitors You are hereHome › Parking Permits › Visitors Visitor Permits TAPS's mission is to protect the parking spaces of those who pay for and properly display a valid parking permit and to ensure a safe and user-friendly environment is maintained on campus. Parking citations will be issued to those who do not abide by UC Merced's parking regulations. Parking permit purchases are on a first-come, first-served basis; this means certain parking permits may not be available at any given time. Purchasing a parking permit does not guarantee space availability. Hourly Non-Affiliated Visitor Parking Permits Visitor permits are for temporary parking in any non-specially marked space in Lake Lot 1 and 2, Evolution Valley lots and visitor spaces in Library Lot 1. Visitor permits are only valid in the lot from where they are purchased.
