They enable Bradley University to offer a more diverse curriculum that is independent of usual income sources, and they provide long-term financial stability for teaching, research and scholarship in specific fields. Endowed chairs empower Bradley University to attract, retain and honor distinguished faculty members, recognizing them for their academic excellence. For donors who generously support the endowment, endowed chairs are living memorials, perpetuating the donor’s name and signifying a permanent commitment to quality higher education. © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
