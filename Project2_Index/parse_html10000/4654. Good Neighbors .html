Our In It Together Community Partnership program promotes good neighbor guidelines, provides resources to resolve issues, and helps enhance the quality of life in our neighborhoods. Students and permanent residents have many things in common, including the desire to enjoy a good quality of life and feel safe in our homes. We also sometimes have differences - in schedules, priorities, and habits. UCR works in partnership with our neighbors and the City of Riverside to find solutions for issues that arise from these differences. After all, when it comes to building a better community - we're in it together. Guide to Laws and Ordinances Quick contact information for neighbor concerns or incidents. The National Leader in Communty Service Washington Monthly nationally ranked UCR as #2 in Community Service, demonstrating our students' extraordinary commitment to public outreach and contribution.
