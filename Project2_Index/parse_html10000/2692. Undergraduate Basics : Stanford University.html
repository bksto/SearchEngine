At Stanford, we are committed to providing a comprehensive need-based financial aid program that makes it financially possible for admitted students to attend Stanford. Our admission program is need-blind, meaning, for all but some international applicants, financial status will not affect the admission decision. How Aid Works A freshman class of about 1,700 students and a transfer class of about 30 students are admitted each year. Stanford reviews each applicant with an eye to academic excellence, intellectual vitality and personal context.
