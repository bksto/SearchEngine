Student Validity Process To assure that the student who registers in an online course/program is the same student who participates in and completes the program and receives the academic credits: The student who registers for the online course is ‘batched’ into the course through SPIRE and Blackboard Learn using only the information from their registration. The student uses their assigned login credential to actually log into the course each time they want access to the course. (Now the same for SPIRE and Bb Learn) OIT’s acceptable use policy further addresses this topic.  Therefore, the person who has those credentials is the same person doing the work. Online faculty state in their syllabus information about the University’s academic honesty rules and the potential results for any violations. Online faculty input grades via SPIRE for each student based upon the same registration information.   Quick Links Blackboard Learn login How to Register Registration Checklist SPIRE UMail Academic Policies and Procedures Academic Calendar 100 Venture Way • Hadley, MA 01035-9430 • Contact Us • Comments and Questions Privacy Policy © 2015 University of Massachusetts Amherst.
