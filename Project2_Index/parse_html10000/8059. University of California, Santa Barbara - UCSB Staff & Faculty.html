Most Important Items that academic advisors should know about the Office of the Registrar Scheduling & Publications Unit (in Microsoft Word format) Requesting Access to Student Systems (STAR, SREG, UADMIT) Before being granted access to any student systems (such as AAA, eGrades, STAR, etc.), all staff and faculty members must complete the required online FERPA training available at https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/ferpatraining/. After the FERPA training has been completed, departments may request access at https://apps.sa.ucsb.edu/star/depts/deptlogin.asp. Student system access can only be requested by the department administrator (usually the MSO or Business Officer), who has been assigned a department password for this purpose. Please email Regaccess@sa.ucsb.edu with any questions. Staff members responsible for approving access to student systems (Admissions, BARC, Financial Aid, Registrar, etc.) can login here. Note to UCSB Staff and Faculty: If there are other resources available through the Office of the Registrar that you feel would be a benefit to your staff or faculty or other UCSB staff or faculty, please send us an email and let us know. Thank you.
