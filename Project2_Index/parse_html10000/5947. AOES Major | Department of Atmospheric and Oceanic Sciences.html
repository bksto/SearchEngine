The AEOS major is exciting, timely, and relevant. Contact an advisor for more information! Preparation for the Major Two courses from Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS): 1/1L, 2/2L, 3/3L AOS 2 and AOS 3 are suggested for students concentrating in dynamics/synoptic meteorology and air pollution AOS 1 is suggested for students concentrating in oceanography or climate studies. 1 of two Chemistry Sequences: Chemistry and Biochemistry sequence for physical scientists: 20A and 20B* Chemistry and Biochemistry sequence for life scientists: 14A and 14B 1 of two Calculus Sequences: Calculus sequence for physical scientists and engineers: Math 31A, 31B, 32A, 32B, 33A, and 33B* Calculus sequence for life scientists: Math 3A, 3B, 3C 1 of three Physics Sequences: Engineering Physics sequence lectures: 1A, 1B, 1C; and labs: 4AL, 4BL* Honors Physics sequence lectures: 1AH, 1BH, 1CH; and labs: 4AL, 4BL Life Science Physics sequence lectures: 6A, 6B, 6C Program in Computing 10A * Students interested in graduate school are very strongly recommended to take the physical sciences sequence. Transfer Students Transfer applicants to the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Environmental Sciences major with 90 or more units must complete as many of the following introductory courses as possible prior to admission to UCLA: one year of calculus, one year of calculus-based physics with laboratory, one general chemistry course with laboratory for majors, and one C++ programming course. Refer to the UCLA Transfer Admission Guide for up-to-date information regarding transfer selection for admission. The Major Four courses from Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) 101, 102, 103, 104, and M105 Three additional upper division AOS courses selected in consultation with the undergraduate advisers Two upper division courses from a list of Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics and Statistics courses selected in consultation with the undergraduate advisers *** Courses taken to fulfill requirements must be taken for letter grades.*** For the official requirements, please visit the UCLA Registrar website.
