Since tuition covers only about two-thirds of the cost of a Stanford education, every student gains from the generosity of past and present benefactors. During the 2013–14 school year, more than 5,000 parents gave a combined $5 million to The Stanford Fund. About Parent Partners Parent Partners is a unique opportunity open to parents of current Stanford undergraduates. Those who give $1,500 or more annually (per family) to The Stanford Fund become members and receive the following: Invitations to special events Recognition in Stanford publications Special communications throughout the year Volunteer Opportunities Stanford parents are extremely generous with their time. Some get involved in their local area through the Stanford Alumni Association. Others help with Stanford gatherings in their home or workplace. The Parent Partners Committee for The Stanford Fund raises gifts by spreading the word about the Parent Partners giving level. Committee volunteers are invited to a special reception during Parents' Weekend and receive recognition in Stanford publications. The Parents' Advisory Board leads the way in volunteerism. In addition to assisting with outreach events, the board provides feedback to the university's administration and assists with fundraising. This group of 55 families from around the world meets on campus three times per year. To get involved, simply fill out our Parents' Program Volunteer Form [PDF].
