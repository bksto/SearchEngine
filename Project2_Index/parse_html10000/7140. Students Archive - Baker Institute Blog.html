Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Monday, December 22 at 9:34am The caricatures of politics and culture that Maduro has woven into real policies in recent months could raise questions across the international community and especially from those countries relying on a stable Venezuela for trade and cooperation.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Friday, December 12 at 10:41am Pemex was established in 1939 as Mexico’s national oil company. Now, in an unprecedented break from the last 75 years, Mexico is opening its energy sector to foreign and private investment. Mexico’s energy reform could boost economic growth in Houston.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Tuesday, November 18 at 11:02am Since its highly classified beginnings in 2012, Colombia’s peace process with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) has advanced through different stages of visibility and civil involvement.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Thursday, November 13 at 4:11pm Although the Yazidi people have only recently garnered world attention, they have been subject to a history of persecution, their roots dating back thousands of years to the Mesopotamian era. Most recently, they have become the target of the Islamic State because of their ancient religious practices, derived from Zoroastrianism, which IS believes is incompatible with their Islamic State and condemns as “devil-worship.” The Yazidi’s misery began when IS seized Sinjar, a semiautonomous northern region of Iraq and a Yazidi safe-haven, which resulted in the displacement, deaths and enslavement of thousands of Yazidis and has left the future of this minority in question.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Tuesday, November 11 at 11:49am In 1925, Mahatma Gandhi said, “The cause of many of our diseases is the condition of our lavatories and our bad habit of disposing of excreta anywhere and everywhere.” It has been 89 years since Gandhi urged India to give utmost importance to sanitation, however little improvement has been made. The World Health Organization (WHO) […] [Read More] Categories: Disease and Poverty, Health Policy Forum, Students Print Arab women superheroes define empowerment Posted by James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Friday, October 24 at 1:14pm It is dangerous to have a single version of femininity, and it is impossible to have a universal definition of empowerment for women. The U.S. media disregards this by its often narrow, Western-based depiction of female empowerment. The negative depictions of Middle Eastern citizens in the news result in a general rise in Islamophobia; many […] [Read More] Categories: Center for the Middle East, Students, Women and Human Rights in the Middle East Tags: Baker Institute | Majida’s Diaries | Qahera Print Student Blog: Tapping Mexico’s shale gas resources — Future promise and practical challenges Posted by James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Tuesday, September 9 at 12:11pm Although the energy reform might boost production and wean Mexico off its reliance on imports, major uncertainties remain for Mexico’s natural gas success: clashes over land rights and use, water shortages, and investment risks for foreign companies.

Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Monday, August 25 at 3:55pm Race has been closely tied to Mexican identity since the Mexican Revolution in 1910. The national ideology is centered on mestizaje, referring to the mixing between Spaniards and indigenous peoples. According to this belief, true “Mexicanness” is linked to being mestizo, or someone who is exclusively of Spanish and indigenous descent. Some Mexicans believe in […] [Read More] Categories: Mexico Center, Students Tags: Afro-Mexican | Baker Institute Print Intern blog: ISIS doesn’t have to prevail — Securing a political solution for Iraq Posted by James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Friday, August 8 at 9:54am The images of masked militants from ISIS streaming into Iraq have led to panic and assertions that the end of Iraq is imminent. While ISIS (an acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which is also known as ISIL or IS) should not be taken lightly, the fears that a permanent jihadist state […] [Read More] Categories: Conflict Resolution, Students Tags: Baker Institute | ISIS Print Why the MERS virus matters Posted by James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy on Friday, July 25 at 8:45am The last time you went to an airport, did you see signs inquiring if you have been to the Middle East? No, they are not covered in cliché images of camels, enticing tourists to visit the region. Rather, they are uninspiring health advisories from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warning travelers about […] [Read More] Categories: Kirstin Matthews, Science and Technology Policy, Students Tags: academic freedom | Baker Institute | MERS Print Loading...
