Important Announcements 2015-2016 Financial Aid Application & Deadlines: Beginning January 1, 2015, you may complete, electronically sign and submit your 2015-2016 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by visiting www.fafsa.gov. The filing deadline for the FAFSA is Monday, March 2, 2015.  To reduce possible mistakes and streamline the financial aid application process, students and parents may be eligible to use the IRS Data Retrieval process. This means when filling out your FAFSA you may be eligible to automatically retrieve your federal tax information directly from the IRS into your FAFSA! To use this feature, we strongly encourage you and/or your parents to file your federal tax returns as early as possible before completing the FAFSA. The IRS Data Retrieval process will be available beginning February 1, 2015. The deadline to submit all requested documents is Thursday, May 14, 2015.  Only students that meet both deadlines (March 2 and May 14) will have their registration fees deferred.  Students not meeting the deadlines MUST pay their registration fees from their own resources by the payment deadline. If you are unable to use the IRS Data Retrieval process, you may be asked to submit a copy of your/your parents 2014 IRS Federal Tax Return Transcript. The Financial Aid Office no longer accepts copies of the student and/or parent federal tax return. You may request a FREE of charge transcript of the 2014 federal tax return from the IRS in one of four ways: Online at www.irs.gov – Click “Get Transcript of Your Tax Records.” Click “Get Transcript ONLINE” or “Get Transcript by MAIL.
