Download Photo Students who once struggled to pass the Quantitative Business Analysis and Management Science courses required for their business degree are now getting assistance from students who have previously taken the classes. "It's a course with lots of statistics and between 1 and 2,000 students enroll every semester, " said Sinjini Mitra, assistant professor of information systems and decision sciences who teaches the course and is overseeing the SI effort in Mihaylo College. "We were looking at ways of improving the pass rate for the program and met with Marty Bonsangue, one of the movers to develop the Supplemental Instruction program in the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics." Now into its fourth semester, the Supplemental Instruction effort in business is working. In spring 2014, the average final grades were 10 percent higher for participants in supplemental instruction than those who did not participate, said Mitra. The course GPA for students in the program also increased based on the number of sessions they attended. Peer-led sessions are not tutoring, stressed Mitra. "SI leaders attend the class with those they work with, so that the sessions they offer are tailored to that specific teacher and the pace of the actual course." During the sessions, students work in groups reviewing concepts and working on practice problems, not homework. "It's very interactive, so it facilitates sharing of information and helping each other." And because they are working with a fellow student, "students open up a lot. This provides feedback on problem areas," Mitra explained. The program is working so well that students who once struggled are now peer leaders. "My journey with SI all started when I began to attend SI sessions for ISDS 361A," said Madison Kimura, a senior business administration-marketing major. "I ended up enjoying the sessions because it helped me prepare for the class and made me feel confident that I was really learning the material. I realized I was less nervous by the time the midterm came, whereas other classmates, who did not attend SI, felt more unprepared and nervous. "SI did not create my study habits, but I can say that it did enhance it," she explained. "I was very pleased with my exam grades for this course and I ended up with an A+ at the end of the semester." When she enrolled for the 361B course, Kimura made it a priority because of her past. She earned an A in that class as well. This semester, she is an SI leader. "I realized how much SI had helped me and I wanted to be able to give back and do the same for other students," Kimura said. Through being a leader, "I have already learned a lot about myself and my abilities. I am thankful for this opportunity because it makes me really happy to know that I am here to make a difference and help students." CSUF piloted its SI Program in 2007 in several calculus and introductory biology courses. By spring 2009, it had expanded to 10 SI workshop sections in the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, as well as for individual courses in the colleges of Humanities and Social Sciences, and Engineering and Computer Science through the University Learning Center, said Trista O'Connell, SI coordinator. "In 2013-2014, thanks to an ambitious CSU Chancellor's Office program to improve student success — retention, graduation rates, closing the achievement gap — SI was institutionalized campuswide as a recognized student-success, high-impact practice," explained O'Connell. Currently, the University's SI Program supports more than 30 courses and 224-plus course sections across four colleges, O'Connell noted.
