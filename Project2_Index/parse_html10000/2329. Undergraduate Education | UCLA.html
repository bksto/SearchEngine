A can-do spirit emanates from every class and student, and undergraduate students are integral to this momentum. Combine that with the resources and opportunities you would expect from one of the highest ranked schools in the nation, and it's not a question of if our students will make a difference — it's a question of when. Majors and Minors The Undergraduate Division offers 125 majors across five academic divisions. And because these are the most defining years in a student's life, deciding on a major can be just as meaningful as deciding on a university. Whatever your intellectual curiosities, hobbies or career aspirations, chances are you'll find what you're looking for at UCLA. With more than 109 academic departments, including top-ranked programs and instruction in 40 different languages, the biggest challenge you'll face is what to choose. Continue to Admission Continue to Majors/Minors College of Letters and Science The College of Letters and Science is the overarching umbrella that encompasses the social sciences, the humanities, the physical and life sciences, and undergraduate education. It's the crossroads of perspectives, where students analyze and question. It's where they learn to think and write, both critically and creatively, about the literatures, social issues and languages of other cultures and where they're encouraged to teach us everything they can about their own. Continue to the College of Letters & Science Social Sciences Division The Social Sciences Division guides students toward socially, culturally and environmentally relevant thinking and action. From African American studies and political science to anthropology and communication studies, the social sciences explore how the world works. And as an institution at the forefront of progress, UCLA endows its students with the ability not only to prepare for changes in the world but to bring change about. Continue to the Division of Social Sciences Humanities Division Educators and writers. Linguists and literary critics. Historians and philosophers. These are only a few of the many roles students in the Humanities Division assume regularly at UCLA. And while the content may vary across disciplines, humanities students, in all of their roles, continue to analyze, theorize, write and read about the same important thing — the human condition. Continue to the Division of Humanities Physical Sciences Division Concrete discovery — that's what the Division of Physical Sciences is all about. From astronomy and mathematics to geophysics and chemistry, students in the physical sciences are on a perpetual quest for truth in which the biggest differences between disciplines are the methods they use and the discoveries they make. Continue to the Division of Physical Sciences Life Sciences Division The Division of Life Sciences is devoted to the study of living organisms. Whether they focus on ecology, genetics, cell biology or psychology, life sciences students share one thing in common: a fascination with the existence and evolution of all forms of life. With 12 different majors and five minors, the Life Sciences Division at UCLA offers insight, understanding and truths concerning the blueprints of life. Continue to the Division of Life Sciences Undergraduate Education Division The campus-wide general education curriculum is overseen by the Division of Undergraduate Education, which provides students with challenging and rewarding academic experiences like the Freshman Cluster Program, Fiat Lux Seminars and the Writing II Program.
