That's why the Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) is dedicated to helping prospective students get the assistance they may need to attend UIC. The goal of OSFA is to make the application process for financial aid as simple as possible. In fact, the OSFA website clearly explains costs to attend UIC; the financial aid application process; and the types of aid available. The site also includes downloadable forms, and helpful links and resources. In the 2009-10 academic year: UIC undergraduate students were awarded more than $193 million in financial aid, including $105 million in scholarships, grants and waivers, $80 million in loans and $8 million in work study. About 80% of students who applied for financial aid were awarded need-based scholarships or grant aid. For more information, visit the Office of Student Financial Aid website.
