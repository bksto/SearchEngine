About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > Visiting the University Visiting the University We’d like you to come for a visit to the University of Redlands. Sure, we can tell you about our elevated learning experience on a campus with a palm-lined main street, lush green lawns and the canopy of 100-year-old trees. We can describe the stature of our Administration Building built in 1909 and the breathtaking view from its steps. We can tell you about our state-of-the-art facilities and show you pictures of our bulldog mascot. But we think Redlands is best experienced in person. So we invite you to spend some time at Redlands. Take a campus tour. Experience our environment of elevated learning and opportunity. See how and why you fit right in.
