The Veteran Certification Team in the Office of the University Registrar can help you complete forms and certify your enrollment to the VA so that you can receive your educational benefits. A student must be admitted to the university and registered for courses in a degree-seeking program in order to be certified for veterans educational benefits. Each semester after registration, students eligible for benefits must complete a Request for Enrollment Certification and submit it to the Office of the University Registrar located in the Welcome Center. A student will be certified during a semester only after he or she completes a Request for Enrollment Certification. If you are considering changing to the Post-9/11 GI Bill for fall 2009, you must first complete VA form 22-1990 to apply for this benefit. The application for the new chapter will be available May 1, 2009. Once you have completed this application, please print a copy for our files before you complete a Request for Enrollment Certification for fall 2009. Students enrolled in a graduate program must also provide a letter from the graduate adviser confirming how their courses satisfy degree requirements. Generally, it takes the Veteran Certification section up to two weeks to submit a certification to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligible veterans and service members on active duty or in the reserves who have never received VA education benefits must complete an Application for VA Education Benefits, VA form 22-1990, and be prepared to provide a copy of his or her DD214/member 4 or Notice of Basic Eligibility form. Transfer students who have received VA education benefits at other institutions must complete a VA form 22-1995, Request for Change of Program or Place of Training. Eligible dependents of veterans who have never received education benefits must complete an Application for Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance, VA form 22-5490. Transfer students who have received dependent education benefits at other institutions must complete VA form 22-5495, Request for Change of Program or Place of Training Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance. You may obtain these forms online below or from the Office of the University Registrar in the Welcome Center. Hazlewood exemption Students who qualify under the Hazlewood Act are exempted from paying tuition and required fees provided the student is enrolled in a state-funded program.
