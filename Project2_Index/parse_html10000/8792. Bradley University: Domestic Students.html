All other applicants should see the Check-off List for International Applicants. Applicants must hold a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university, or the international equivalent, prior to beginning graduate study. Applicants who have achieved a grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale in the last 60 hours of undergraduate coursework are eligible for unconditional admission to the Graduate School. Applications falling below this GPA may be considered for conditional admission on the basis of a combination of other factors including, but not limited to, scores on standardized tests, preparation at the undergraduate level, quality of work, recommendations and other relevant factors. Students admitted conditionally will be informed in their admission letter of the conditions they must satisfy to remove the conditional status. Students cannot receive financial assistance, nor can they graduate until the conditional status is removed. The Graduate School application requirements are listed below. Individual programs may require additional application materials, and may have more selective admission requirements than those of the Graduate School; please refer to the Programs section of the Graduate Catalog for these requirements. Applicants can submit all documents online via the application status portal.
