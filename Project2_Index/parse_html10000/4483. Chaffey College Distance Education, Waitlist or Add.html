(Click on any of the steps for detailed information) Hybrid Classes - Students waitlisted or wishing to add a hybrid course should attend the first class meeting on the day, time and location listed in the schedule of classes. Step 1: Add yourself to the course waitlist in ChaffeyView. This can be done during the registration period for any course that is full. Should a space in the course become available, you will receive an email indicating that you can enroll in the class. You will have 48 hours to do this. If you do not receive an email by the Friday before classes begin, you should move on to step 2. If the waitlists for a class are closed, (generally the Friday before classes begin) you should move on to step 2. You will be requesting to petition or add the class. Step 2: Go to the current course list on the DE website and click on the section number link. The links will be available the week prior to the start of the class. The links will remain available through the first week of the class. If you have added to the course waitlist, you should indicate your place on the list. Step 3: Wait. If the instructor is able to add you to the course, you will receive an email that contains an add code. Use this code to enroll in the class in ChaffeyView. As instructors sometimes receive hundreds of requests to add their courses, they will send an email ONLY if they are able to add you to the course. If you do not recieve an email by the end of the first week of the class, you should consider your alternate schedule options. Step 4: Log on to ChaffeyView and enroll in the course, using the authorization code provided by the instructor in the email. Step 5: Access the course on Moodle. You wil have to wait one business day before you can access the course on Moodle. Once you are able to sign on, click on the name of the course in your course listing. Read and throughly expore the course site. Many instructors have "attendance" tasks you must complete the first day or so of the course.   Update Your E-mail Address!
