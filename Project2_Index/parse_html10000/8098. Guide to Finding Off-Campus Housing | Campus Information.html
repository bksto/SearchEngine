No, I don’t mean finals (although that might ACTUALLY be worse) but scrambling to find off-campus housing.   If you are looking to move off-campus for the first time, it is completely overwhelming. If you are looking to move somewhere different from this year, it can still be difficult. The main options in Ann Arbor are apartments (both buildings and high rises, usually for 1-5 people), houses (for larger groups of 4-8) or co-ops (which house large groups of people who work as a group to fulfill landlord duties).   Here are some tips, no matter what type of housing you’re interested in: Start EARLY! Most students sign their leases between September and November, so if you are really interested in a specific area, move fast! Think about where you want to live and why. Do you have class on north campus? You should probably live close to CC Little. Do you attend every basketball game? You might want to live near South Campus. Do you work at the chemistry building? You might want to live near to the diag. Think about your daily routine and what types of activities you like to do off campus (Farmer’s markets, restaurant locations), this should help dictate the best place for you! Know a range of how many people you want to live with and what they are all willing to pay per month. If you love being in big groups, a co-op might be for you. If you want to live with your closest friend, options might be more limited to an apartment, or visa versa a larger friend group may only fit in a house. Don’t forget to budget for utilities (if not included in rent)! Look online first. Visit the Beyond the Diag site or Google “Ann Arbor housing companies” or notice the names that are advertised on the side of houses around campus. Look up these companies and see what kind of options they offer and what is still available. Contact the housing groups ASAP and ask for a tour. Before you put down any money or sign a lease, it is best to have the entire group who plans on living together go through the space and imagine yourselves in it. Maybe nobody is willing to live in the basement, something that would cause major problems if you hadn’t talked about it first! Act fast. Like I said, some people sign contracts very early in the year. Although there is always something available, it might not be in your desired price range or location. So once you find something that fits, sign the dotted line! ​ For more information, check out these sites: http://www.icc.coop/prospective/houses/ https://offcampushousing.umich.edu/ https://www.cribspot.com/map/umich?e=-83.6283&n=42.3304&s=42.2238&w=-83.8480&z=13 and be sure to Follow Beyond the Diag on Twitter.
