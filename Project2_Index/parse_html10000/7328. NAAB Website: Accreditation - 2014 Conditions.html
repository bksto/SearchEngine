All programs, including candidates, with visits scheduled for 2016 must use the 2014 Conditions.   The 2014 Conditions for Accreditation are the result of three years’ collaborative effort between the NAAB, The American Institute of Architects, the American Institute of Architecture Students, the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, and the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards. Several other scholarly organizations and individuals also contributed to the process.   Please see the Guide to the 2014 Conditions for Accreditation and Preparation of an Architecture Program Report for detailed instructions.
