Through this fellowship, Global Ph.D. Students undertake doctoral research in biology, chemistry, or engineering with NYU Abu Dhabi faculty.  The fellowship is a unique opportunity to pursue advanced research across two exciting campuses. Students who receive the fellowship complete all graduate coursework with their home NYU departments in New York, and spend subsequent years working with NYUAD faculty members in Abu Dhabi. Prospective candidates in biology and chemistry apply submit a standard NYU GSAS admissions application, and engineering candidates apply to the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. There is no separate application for the fellowship; any applicant expressing interest in undertaking the research phase of the Ph.D. with NYUAD faculty will be considered. Please follow the links on this page to the fellowship subject area of your choice, as the selection criteria and timelines differ in each discipline. Ph.D. application deadlines are set by each GSAS or School of Engineering department. Applications will be reviewed by joint committees of faculty from NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU New York, with formal offers of admission extended by the relevant NYU New York school.
