Committed to leadership in innovation, breakthrough integrative design, and commercialization of technology and design, the graduate program advocates a new form of design knowledge merged from theory and practice, and forged with connections to the medical, energy, aerospace, computer, and entertainment industries. The program for the Master of Science in Industrial Design degree is a two-year curriculum of 36 semester hours. The graduate program offers a new perspective on creativity, product and system development, services, and environment with an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies: design for health, design for sustainability, and design for the world community. Before the first semester of graduate study, a personalized curriculum is developed to meet a student’s research topic and interdisciplinary study plan. In conjunction with the required courses, elective courses may be taken in the College of Architecture, Bauer College of Business, College of Engineering, College of Hotel Restaurant and Management or other departments and colleges of the university in order to complete a personalized program of study. Students can achieve Entrepreneurship Certificate from the Bauer College of Business. The Entrepreneurship Certificate is a joint endeavor between the Industrial Design program at the College of Architecture and the Department of Marketing & Entrepreneurship at the Bauer College of Business, ranked as one of the top entrepreneurship programs in the nation. This certificate program provides a series of courses in entrepreneurship and the business skills necessary to commercialize new design opportunities. Students have additional business content that is not typically offered in Master of Industrial Design studies and more start up content than a traditional MBA. Degree Plan: Personalized Program of Study The personalized graduate degree plan will be developed in consultation with the Director of the Industrial Design program in order to meet students’ individual research goals. Candidates who do not have an undergraduate degree in Industrial Design are advised to take an additional 17 credits focusing on the development of fundamental design thinking and visualization skills. The Director of Industrial Design program and instructors will advise and approve appropriate courses including undergraduate Industrial Design studios.
