This approach requires a relationship between the university and the community organization in which both are active participants in the service learning experience.  Equally important to the student’s learning is the service work to be performed at a site.  We believe in this model so strongly that Anna Fleming has been assigned to the role of Service Partner Liaison where her primarily responsibilities include developing and maintaining strong, healthy relationships between the university and the service partners.  If you are interested in becoming an official service partner, please contact Anna Fleming at 760-750-4003 or afleming@csusm.edu. As a co-educator to CSUSM students, we feel it is important to keep you abreast of any new developments in our office.  We will continue to post events and other interesting service learning/civic engagement news. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
