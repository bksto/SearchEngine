In fact, the opposite is true. We need economists’ thinking now more than ever — provided we match the tools of economics to the proper task.

No central bank had considered any of these measures (zero interest rate policy, quantitative easing, credit easing, forward guidance, negative deposit rate, and unlimited foreign exchange intervention, respectively) before 2008. Today, they have become a staple of policymakers’ toolkits.

While everyone should be closely watching Greece's actions, it is unlikely that even a Syriza victory will spark widespread sovereign bank contagion or a Greek exit from the EU, recently referred to as a "Grexit."

Michael Spence At a time of lackluster economic growth, countries around the world are attempting to devise and implement strategies to spur and sustain recovery. The key word is strategy: to succeed, policymakers must ensure that measures to open the economy, boost public investment, enhance macroeconomic stability, and increase reliance on markets and incentives for resource allocation are implemented in reasonably complete packages. Pursuing only some of these objectives produces distinctly inferior results. Read more — Biography: Professor A.

New manufacturing technologies have generated feverish excitement about what some see as a Third Industrial Revolution. In the years ahead, technological improvements in robotics and automation will boost productivity and efficiency, implying significant economic gains for companies. But, unless the proper policies to nurture job growth are put in place, it remains uncertain whether demand for labor will continue to grow as technology marches forward.

Auburn versus Alabama—an intrastate matchup of public universities that dates to 1893—could be a case study. His research also shows that sports rivalries are stronger when their historical records against each other are closer."

These are the prime What am I doing with my life? years, in other words, which prompts many people to behave in ways that suggest 'an ongoing or failed search for meaning,' the authors write. Their data suggests that these are the ages when people are more likely to either train harder for a marathon or run one for the first time; they’re also the ages when more people tend to cheat on their marriages or take their own lives." Read more — Biography: Professor Adam Alter Department: Marketing — Research in the News Reforming China’s Commanding Heights - By A. Michael Spence Chinese President Xi Jinping’s massive anti-corruption campaign has advanced a number of key objectives: It has gone a long way toward restoring confidence in the Communist Party’s commitment to a merit-based system; countered a decades-old pattern of public-sector domination; reduced the power of vested interests to block reform; and bolstered Xi’s popularity among private-sector actors, if far less so with the bureaucracy. In short, Xi’s effort to root out corruption has empowered both the Party and the reformers. The question is how far they will take their reform ambitions. Read more — Biography: Professor A. Michael Spence Department: Economics — Opinion The DHL Global Connectedness Index, coauthored by Prof. Pankaj Ghemawat Excerpt from The Economist -- "Globalisation’s advance has never been inevitable or smooth; nor, despite some backward steps since the crash, has it ended. That, at least, is the conclusion of the latest DHL Global Connectedness Index, published earlier this month. Two economists, Pankaj Ghemawat of New York University’s Stern School and Steven Altman of IESE Business School compiled it using data from 140 countries, which account for 99% of the world’s GDP and 95% of its population. It shows that, after a big post-crisis drop, the trend of growing global interconnection resumed last year. Globalisation is back."

'So our conclusion about soft earmarks is a more nuanced finding, but does indicate that soft earmarks are effective. And for the most part, I don’t think people are aware of the mechanisms through which allocations are made.'"

What Could Have Avoided It? - By Thomas Philippon Economists disagree over the origin of the Eurozone Crisis. This column uses a quantitative framework to sort through the various channels and policy impacts. It argues that fiscal and macroprudential policies are complements, not substitutes. Prudent fiscal policy is helpful but cannot by itself undo private leverage booms. Both prudent fiscal policies and macroprudential policies are required to stabilise the economy and make the Eurozone a viable monetary union.

Kinloch at the time was a politically autonomous black community, created in 1948 by residents of an unincorporated area of St. Louis County—then a blank space on the map of mainly middle-class white towns that had developed the region over the years.

Whether this strategy is effective depends in part on how consumers view the country itself, according to new research by NYU Stern Professor Durairaj Maheswaran and colleagues. Read more — Biography: Professor Durairaj Maheswaran Department: Marketing — Research Highlights A Homestead Act for the 21st Century - By Kim Schoenholtz When the U.S. government wanted people to settle the western frontier, it gave them land, not a loan. Today, when the government seeks to promote home ownership, it offers cheap debt. That creates bad incentives and risks financial instability. American history teaches us that the government should subsidize home equity, not mortgage debt.

Read more — Biography: Professor Viral Acharya Department: Finance — Research Highlights Making Sense of Globalization - By Pankaj Ghemawat Not so many years ago, the forward march of globalization seemed to many people to be almost a law of nature. Trade would always grow twice as fast as GDP, financial markets would continually become more integrated, foreign direct investment (FDI) would proliferate freely, and information and people would move around the world more easily. Borders and distance might cease to matter at all. But then came 2008 and the global financial crisis. It hit trade and capital flows hard, and now many question whether globalization has stalled or even gone into reverse.

Unfortunately, only one of its four engines is functioning properly: the Anglosphere (the United States and its close cousin, the United Kingdom). Read more — Biography: Professor Nouriel Roubini Department: Economics — Opinion Growth in the New Climate Economy - By A. Michael Spence Action to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change has long been viewed as fundamentally opposed to economic growth. Indeed, the fragility of the global economic recovery is often cited as a justification to delay such action. But a recent report, “The New Climate Economy: Better Growth, Better Climate” released by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, refutes this reasoning. Far from being a detriment to economic growth, the report concludes that efforts to combat climate change could boost growth considerably – and relatively soon. Read more — Biography: Professor A.

Sharing responsibility in the sharing economy - By Arun Sundararajan New peer-to-peer ‘sharing’ platforms have the potential to boost living standards across the many countries which they span.

A study in 2008, titled 'Monopoly Money,' featured a gift card denominated in dollars. Even though the gift card lost value instantly when people used it, people were still more likely to spend freely with it than they did with cash."

Though geopolitical risks – the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the rise of the Islamic State and growing turmoil across the Middle East, China’s territorial disputes with its neighbors, and now mass protests in Hong Kong and the risk of a crackdown – have multiplied, markets have remained buoyant, if not downright bubbly. Read more — Biography: Professor Nouriel Roubini Department: Economics — Opinion Prof. Kim Schoenholtz's research on the global impact of the US dollar Excerpt from Financial Times -- "That significant parts of the global financial system are running on dollars is no surprise. We discussed some of the basics – the fact that the dollar accounts for 80% of trade finance and 87% of foreign currency market transactions – in an earlier post on the reserve currencies. But there is more, much more. The fact of the matter is that there is a parallel dollar-based financial system – call it the 'Global Dollar system' – that operates outside the United States." Read more — Biography: Professor Kim Schoenholtz Department: Economics — Research in the News The Dollar is Now Everyone's Problem - By Kim Schoenholtz The global financial crisis started in 2007 when European banks came under increasing strain. If forced to specify the crisis kickoff, we would pick Thursday, August 9, the day that BNP Paribas halted redemptions from three investment funds because it couldn’t value their holdings of U.S. mortgages. Responding to the ensuing market scramble for liquidity, the ECB injected €95 billion that day into the European banking system and the Federal Reserve put $24 billion in theirs. Today, with the benefit of hindsight, these numbers appear quaint, but then they seemed enormous. (You can find a contemporary account by one of us here.)

Smith & Ingo Walter Mr. Modi has political capital to spend in India, and he ought to use some of it to winnow government subsidies, reduce protection of certain economic sectors, and to do all he can to increase basic competition in goods and services. Infrastructure and education are important too, but these take a long time to improve. The most immediate need is to get the growth rate back to a 9-10 per cent level.

Smith and Ingo Walter Department: Finance  — Opinion Big Data and Predictive Analytics in Health Care - By Vasant Dhar The terms “predictive analytics” and “health-care analytics” in Google Trends show an impressive growth in interest since 2011. But what is the status of predictive analytics in health care at the current time? To what extent are predictive analytics actually being used in health-care practice? For several years now, there have been dire warnings of health-care spending exceeding 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the year 2025. While much of the increase in cost is attributed to medical technology which saves, extends, or improves lives, the rise in costs of health care is nevertheless alarming. Big data and analytics can provide an important part of the solution for curbing rising costs and improving health care. There's hope for change. But what will it take to make it happen?

Michael Spence In July, the European Commission published its sixth report on economic, social, and territorial cohesion (a term that can be roughly translated as equality and inclusiveness). The report lays out a plan for substantial investment – €450 billion ($583 billion) from three European Union funds – from 2014 to 2020. Given today’s difficult economic and fiscal conditions, where public-sector investment is likely to be crowded out in national budgets, this program represents a major commitment to growth-oriented public sector investment.

A stuffy train, the study concludes, can effectively send commuters into the hands of brands.'This was the mechanism to cope with the loss of personal space in a crowded situation,' said Anindya Ghose, co-director of Stern’s Center for Business Analytics and co-author of the paper.

In 2014, thanks to enormous sacrifices of the Greek people, the state budget has been balanced and Greece even has a primary surplus (before paying interest). Sovereign debt was reduced through the haircut of private bondholders, but remains large. Structural reforms were implemented in the labor market, and we wait for reforms in other sectors. Greece was successful in re-entering the world money markets after 4 years of exile by issuing 5-year bonds at 4.75% interest.

Programs like the mortgage interest rate deduction and guarantees on mortgages bought and securitized by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae cost the taxpayer about $200 billion in lost tax revenues each year. These policies are highly regressive, benefiting the rich with expensive houses much more than those with average homes, and amplifying inequality in society. The financial crisis illustrated the risks of policies subsidizing mortgage debt, with many households taking on mortgages they could only service as long as house prices continued to go up and they stayed employed.

Michael Spence Recent advances in technology have created an increasingly unified global marketplace for labor and capital. The ability of both to flow to their highest-value uses, regardless of their location, is equalizing their prices across the globe. In recent years, this broad factor-price equalization has benefited nations with abundant low-cost labor and those with access to cheap capital. Some have argued that the current era of rapid technological progress serves labor, and some have argued that it serves capital. What both camps have slighted is the fact that technology is not only integrating existing sources of labor and capital but also creating new ones. Read more — Biography: Professor A.

How things have changed! The latest data show inflation in the euro area has slowed well below the European Central Bank's stated goal, and many of the economies risk a renewed contraction. Downward pressure on prices is likely to persist. It is not out of the question that the region could sink into a sustained deflation that would further cripple the economy. The ECB needs to take this threat seriously and demonstrate now that it has the policy tools (and is prepared to use them) in the event of a new deflationary shock.

They don’t have to say whether they changed their holdings in the interim. In a recent paper, Professor Brown and Christopher G.

That might sound like a strange thing to many people now because America is engaged in a debate on the ethical nature of capitalism. What I'm hoping is that we as Americans, and people in other countries, too, can think more clearly about capitalism as the engine of growth that lifts people out of poverty. It can only work when you have efficient markets, and you can only have efficient markets when you have government tamping down on monopoly, on those who exploit public goods, and on those who pass externalities on to others.

What a nasty irony, therefore, that public ownership gives company managers reason to favour short-term profits over long-term growth. In a recent paper, John Asker, Joan Farre-Mensa and Alexander Ljungqvist – researchers at New York University and Harvard – find new evidence of this. They compare investment levels at a large sample of private and publicly traded companies over a decade. They find that the private ones invest more than the public ones, growing their total assets by, on average, 6.8 per cent a year versus 3.7 per cent."

But as the number of firms grows GDP volatility shrinks, because firms’ shocks cancel out. With 100 firms, volatility falls to a tenth of the level in a one-firm economy; with 1m firms, it falls to a thousandth. Since there are more firms than this, company-specific shocks disappear."

In some cases, such as Ireland, governments took on excess debt and risks while rescuing failed banks or stimulating the economy. And in yet others, such as Spain, private debt and a growth slowdown engulfed governments too. And in yet others, such as Greece and Italy, governments took on excess debt and ran up deficits.

Despite quarterly profits of over $13 billion, the recent success of the iPad mini, and seemingly strong growth rates for both the iPhone and iPad, the share price is off more than a third from its pre-iPhone-5 launch high of over $700, and the company has shed over $200 billion in market cap over the last five months. Could this merely be the extreme volatility often associated with the digital sector? Or perhaps the expectations of Apple's investors have evolved to mirror those of iconic founder Jobs, demanding nothing less than perfection from the company?

It took Citi about 10 years to get through the last crisis, which began after Continental Illinois, the seventh-largest US bank, failed in 1984 from an excess of aggressive lending and weak credit controls. Citi, which was the most aggressive of the kick-ass lenders of that time, didn’t fail then but came close. John Reed took over as chief executive in 1984 and, under close supervision from the Federal Reserve, nursed it along.
