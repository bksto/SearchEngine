Telephone contact is (415) 506-0234, and email contact is accjc@accjc.org. ACCJC is one of six regional institutional accrediting bodies recognized by the Council for Higher Education and the U.S. Department of Education. In addition, the college is accredited by the National League for Nursing Accreditation Commission, Inc. (NLNAC) and is recognized by the California State Board of Registered Nursing. San Bernardino Valley College conducted a comprehensive Self-Evaluation Report for the ACCJC team visit in October 2014. Based upon the Self-Evaluation Study and the ACCJC Team visit the college was placed on warning by the ACCJC in February 2015. Warning is the least severe of the four sanctions that ACCJC can issue when an institution has not met or partially met standards. San Bernardino Valley College remains fully accredited. The recommendations will not impact students earning credits toward degrees, certificates, and transfers. Financial aid is also available for eligible students. The college will prepare a follow up report to be submitted to the ACCJC in March 2016 demonstrating how the recommendations of the ACCJC have been resolved. ACCJC Action Letter - February 6, 2015 2015 External Team Evaluation Report 2014 Self-Evaluation Report - Final - 7-15-14 2014 Self-Evaluation Report - By Sections   Accreditation Process ACCJC has established a broad set of standards against which accredited colleges are periodically evaluated to ensure the quality of education provided by the institution. These standards are divided into four categories: institutional mission and effectiveness; student learning programs and services; resources (human, physical, technology, and financial); and leadership and governance. Every six years accredited institutions are required to undertake a comprehensive self-study as a means of assessing how well and to what degree they meet these accreditation standards. This self-study typically takes a year to complete, involves the entire campus through a participatory governance process, and culminates in the writing and publication of a sizeable report. Following completion of the self-study, ACCJC sends a visiting team of evaluators (educators from other colleges in the region) to the college for a multiday visit evaluating the quality of the college by “validating” the self-study and assessing the degree to which the college meets the accreditation standards. This step embodies the peer review concept of evaluation, assessment, and quality assurance. The team then produces its own report based upon the visit and their assessment of the self-study. This report along with the team’s confidential recommendations are then submitted to ACCJC for consideration and action. Upon reviewing the visiting team’s report, the commission can ascribe accreditation status to an institution from a list of possible choices, including: reaffirmation of accreditation; placing an institution on “warning”; placing an institution on “probation”; demanding that an institution “show cause” as to why it should not have accreditation withdrawn; or, ”revocation” of accreditation.
