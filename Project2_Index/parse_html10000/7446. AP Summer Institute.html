It will include nine areas for certification for AP and three areas for Pre AP. Each of the AP and Pre AP consultants serving the teachers are strong in subject matter and highly skilled in presentation. History After realizing the need for Advanced Placement training for the teachers in our region, ASU initiated its first Summer Institute in 2004. The Institute was an instant success: we continue to enjoy excellent training, great fellowship and superb accommodations. Arkansas State University will continue to be a most accommodating host for AP Training. Purpose This service for training teachers in AP & Pre AP strategies is provided through the College of Education & Behavioral Science. It will prepare public school teachers to use specific strategies, techniques and resources for creating the successful AP classroom. Curriculum Student success in Advanced Placement courses is a strong indicator of future success in college. This year, the Institute will offer training in eleven AP and Pre-AP subjects. All the AP and Pre AP classes are arranged for both new & experienced teachers. Registration Teachers interested in Advanced Placement Summer Institute can register by July 6, 2015.
