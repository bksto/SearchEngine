This site brings together the original Adventures in Roland Marchand's File Cabinet launched in 1999 and the Marchand Image Archive launched in 2001. With funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, we have expanded the original Marchand image collection to include images from other UC Davis faculty including Andres Resendez, Alan Taylor, Cynthia Brantley, Joan Cadden, Louis Warren, and Karen Halttunen (now at USC). We have supplemented Roland's documentary source problems with lessons based on images in this expanded collection and developed by outstanding teachers associated with The History Project. The Marchand Archive contains two useful collections: the Image Collection and the Documentary Source Problems Collection. Read more about each below. About Roland Roland Marchand, an internationally acclaimed scholar and author of Advertising the American Dream and Creating the Corporate Soul, co-founded the History Project at UC Davis to improve history education, kindergarten through university. Materials from his own award-winning teaching provided the basis for the original online collection.

Faculty members of the UC Davis History Department contribute images used in their teaching. A growing collection with maps, Aztec codices, early Americana, advertising posters and more. Browse through a collection of images that we have paired with lessons or search for images to supplement your lesson plans.        Documentary Source Problems Collection - View Lessons Each assignment in this collection encourages students to apply their analytical skills to a set of primary sources from which they can deduce and explain events from the past. History Project founder Roland Marchand developed documentary source problems for his students at UC Davis. Outstanding teachers, graduate students, and staff from The History Project each have contributed lessons that add to Roland's impressive foundation. Every lesson has also been adapted by Project Fellows for use in high school and middle school classrooms.

When teachers apprentice students in age-appropriate ways, they learn to work with sources, consider different perspectives, analyze and interpret information, and marshal evidence in support of their conclusions. Here's how we do it: The HP's Lesson Planning Template The process of historical investigation provides a backbone for our approach. A team of teachers and scholars defined this process in our best attempt to nail Jell-O to the wall and delineate a linear process analogous to the scientific method. The Process of Historical Investigation, as defined by the History Project We encourage teachers to lead their students in historical investigations big and small. Here's a sample lesson that uses just two sources to great effect: Identifying Colonial Diversity through Passenger Lists Marchand Teaching Library History Project Fellows can consider the Marchand Teaching Library their office on campus. It holds a cabinet packed with standards-based lessons developed by HP Fellows, and shelves filled with 1000+ history books, slide collections, CD-Roms, and DVDs. While Fellows have greater borrowing and copying privileges, local area teachers also are invited to visit and use these resources. Just let us know when we should expect you!
