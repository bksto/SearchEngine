Space Plasma Physics at UCLA has historically been pursued in three separate departments (Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Earth and Space Sciences, and Physics and Astronomy), as well as in the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics. Over the years, UCLA has attracted an exceptional and diverse group of faculty and researchers who are widely respected in the Space Science Community. Space Plasma Physics graduate education occurs via a coordinated program within the Earth and Space Sciences and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. Prospective graduate students should apply to either the Earth and Space Sciences or the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department. If they grant permission to do so, their files will be freely circulated to all UCLA Space Physics faculty for consideration by all. Accepted students may be enrolled in either Department and will be required to satisfy the Core Class requirements of that Department. The written comprehensive, oral comprehensive, candidacy exam and final thesis defense will be conducted according to the policies established in the relevant department. Transfer between departments, after enrollment is simplified by the similarity of the requirements but some additional classes may be required.         The program is subdivided into the following categories   Magnetospheric Physics Planetary Magnetospheres Upper Atmosphere Response to Solar Activity   Related Links UCLA Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Intro.html http://www.oulu.fi/~spaceweb/textbook/magnetosphere.html http://www.geo.mtu.edu/weather/aurora/ Affiliated Faculty Professor Larry Lyons Professor Jonathan Mitchell Professor Richard Thorne Affiliated Researchers Jacob Bortnik Lunjin Chen Heejeong Kim Wen Li Binbin Ni Yukitoshi Nishimura Yong Shi Chih-Ping Wang Xiaoyan Xing Eftyhia Zesta Climate & Weather Chemistry & Radiation Oceanography Space Physics Magnetospheric Physics Planetary Magnetospheres Upper Atmos/Solar Activity University of California, Los Angeles; Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences; Los Angeles, CA 90095-1565 | Phone: (310) 825-1217 | © 2015 UC Regents site by Pendari
