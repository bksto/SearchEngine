The culture of leadership gaining momentum on campus has led many employees to choose to give to the University’s Annual Fund or to another area such as a specific department, program or scholarship. Gifts from faculty and staff not only make a significant financial impact, but help enact positive change, setting an example for alumni and students. We invite you to watch the inspiring student and alumna-produced video from this past May’s Commencement. After watching, if you are inspired by all of the happy students fulfilling their dreams of attaining higher education, you may become a donor in two very simple ways: • Give every month by enrolling in Employee Payroll Deduction, the most popular option of our employee donors. The online form can be completed in just a couple of minutes. Payroll deduction from your paycheck would begin in August. • Give a one-time gift securely online at: www.csusm.edu/donation. If you have any questions about employee giving, contact Associate Director of Development and Annual Giving Sean Briner at sbriner@csusm.edu or ext. 4404.
