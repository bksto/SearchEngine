After moving here, the contrast between her family’s values and her vivid encounters with racism in the public school system sparked her passion for social justice. In 1991, Holman founded the Davis-based Culture CO-OP to provide educators diversity training and address systemic inequity. The alignment between the Culture CO-OP's mission and the UC Davis School of Education's Equity Summit inspired Holman's gift during The Campaign for UC Davis.   "Equity in education is necessary for people to have the opportunity to thrive in life,” said Holman, who is also a Cal Aggie Alumni Association member. “Anything we can do to encourage people to share power and resources is critical, and the Equity Summit has done tremendous work in that area." Holman’s true philanthropic passion, however, is centered in a different kind of giving. Currently the Culture CO-OP has 25 interns, and over the years, hundreds of Aggies have enjoyed hands-on experience and mentoring under Holman’s wing. “My primary investment in UC Davis has been giving back to students. The privilege of working with youth is one of the most important parts of my job,” said Holman, who was nominated by one of her interns to be co-marshal of the centennial Picnic Day Parade. “And the most meaningful aspect of staying connected to UC Davis is bringing students’ attention to equity and social justice issues. It’s never been more critical to share love, power and resources.” These ONE hundred stories represent the people who have transformed UC Davis through their generous support of our first comprehensive fundraising campaign. Together, these stories are the ONE story of The Campaign for UC Davis.
