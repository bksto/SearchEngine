Students qualified for reverse transfer will have earned at least 15 semester credit hours from JDCC, will have earned at least three semester credit hours from Troy University, and will be in good standing at both institutions.</p> <p>Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr., Chancellor of Troy University, said there has always been a strong link between the Alabama Community College System and TROY and that such agreements make good sense.</p> <p>"This opportunity to reward students for the work they do – even though they may do it in reverse order – is still good business," Dr. Hawkins said. "It makes sense and dollars for those graduates and speaks well of both the two-year system and the universities."</p> <p>Dr. William O. Blow, Interim President of Jefferson Davis Community College, said the agreement is good for students.</p> <p>"We teach a broad spectrum of students. This reverse transfer agreement we have with TROY is such an innovative thing," Dr. Blow said. "It's great student service and we are so happy to join Troy University in this effort."</p> <p>The agreement with JDCC is the latest is the latest of several such partnerships for TROY. Agreements have been previously entered with Chattahoochee Valley Community College, Southern Union State Community College, Lurleen B. Wallace Community College, Wallace Community College and Enterprise State Community College.</p> <div style="width:40%;"> <br /> <img src="http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/03/_images/TROY-JDCC-Reverse-Transfer-thumb.jpg" alt="TROY-JDCC-Reverse-Transfer-thumb"/> <br /> <div> <br />Officials from Troy University and Jefferson Davis Community College signed a Reverse Transfer Agreement today at the JDCC campus in Brewton.

The lecture is designed to promote awareness of people who excel in their chosen fields despite physical or mental challenges.</p> <p>"We often experience fear of the unknown, but the unknown is also the address of potential and possibility," Westmoreland said. "We must reach an awareness that good things can be found in life's struggles and that success can be found despite our failures."</p> <p>A resident of New York City, Westmoreland told students that his life changed just a few days short of his 40th birthday when he literally woke up blind.</p> <p>"I woke up in a world of darkness. To literally wake up blind was terrifying," he said. "I sat on the side of my bed going through every 'what if' in my mind. One fear gripped me more than any other – what if I became one of those people who is easier left out than invited in?"</p> <p>In the midst of his fear, Westmoreland found comfort in the words he had heard his mother speak many times during his youth – "God doesn't give you what you can't handle."</p> <p>"It was those simple words that made me determined that I would not be someone who is stuck in a corner, not participating in life," he said. "I knew that I could not do it by myself, and going out as an independent blind person in New York City might be an overwhelming place to start."</p> <p>Westmoreland returned to his home state of Mississippi, spending the next seven months at the Reach Center for the Blind in Tupelo. He came out of the center and returned to New York to tackle the challenges ahead.</p> <p>The challenges Westmoreland would face became even greater when he learned he had an infection in the bones of his foot and doctors were recommended amputation. To ensure his heart was strong enough to endure the surgery, the doctors believed they needed to do additional tests. The tests, however, would likely cause Westmoreland's kidneys to fail and leave him dependent on regular dialysis.</p> <p>"In the course of three days, I was going to lose my leg and my kidneys," he said. "I just felt like this was too much. I had found a way to come back from my blindness, and now I was faced with this. It was in these depths that I realized that Faith means nothing if it is never tested. If I can come back from being blind, I can come back from this."</p> <p>Following the surgery, Westmoreland spent two months in the hospital for rehabilitation, first learning to hobble and then to walk with a prosthetic leg.</p> <p>Not to be deterred, Westmoreland gladly accepted the invitation of a longtime friend, Miles Doleac, to produce the film "The Historian." Recently released across numerous on-demand platforms and coming soon to iTunes, Amazon and Hulu, the film was the winner of "Best Feature Film," "Best Actor" and "Best Supporting Actor" awards at the 2014 Long Island International Film Expo.</p> <p>Westmoreland is currently in pre-production of his second feature film, "The Hollow," which will shoot in June in Mississippi, and continues to maintain an active lifestyle in Manhattan where he recently accepted the post of president of TROY's New York Alumni Chapter.</p> <p>"We have to accept and be willing to change regardless of what challenges we encounter in life," he said. "As you move down your path in life, be aware there will be obstacles and struggles. They are there for a reason."</p> <p>The Helen Keller Lecture is sponsored by Troy University along with longtime university supporters including The Helen Keller Foundation for Research and Education, the Alabama State Department of Education, the Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services, the Alabama Department of Mental Health and the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind.</p> <div style="width:40%;"> <br /> <img src="http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/03/_images/mackenzie-westmoreland-thumb.jpg" alt="mackenzie-westmoreland-thumb"/> <br /></div> Thu, 05 Mar 2015 09:20:31 -0600 2E7B7290-EED5-4331-9FEA-9C254744731E news@troy.edu Chinese New Year opportunity for promoting relationships http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/03/chinese-new-year-opportunity-for-promoting-relationships.html <p><strong>MONTGOMERY</strong> - Celebration of a new year and Alabama's ties with China was the dual focus of the Confucius Institute at Troy University's event at the Montgomery Country Club on Feb. 26.</p> <p>Highlighted by a keynote address by Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield, the evening event provided a platform to discuss Alabama-China business relations as well as the University's impact on the state and in language and culture education in places like Montgomery's LAMP school.</p> <p>"It is through the sharing of the economy and education and culture that creates the bridge that creates the ability to recognize that we are different as governments, but we may not be so different as people and that's what's important," Canfield said. "Troy University has been a very strong partner in this effort, and … we have been the beneficiary of the leadership at TROY."</p> <p>Canfield spoke about the creation of a statewide economic development strategy to focus on building closer ties with the People's Republic of China through the Accelerate Alabama program to provide an emphasis on both economic development and education. Canfield said worldwide, some 126 countries have been introduced to Alabama products.</p> <p>"The journey is never simple. The journey is never without risk … but at the end of the day, this is about opportunity and a vision for the future that we all share in common, no matter whether we are from Alabama or from China," he said. "Let's all continue to work together in a way to see greater understanding, to see greater opportunities, and all of the great economic benefits that come from that."</p> <p>The evening also set the stage to recognize TROY Chancellor Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr., who received the World Confucius Institute's Individual Performance of Excellence Award, one of nine university presidents worldwide and the only in North America to receive the honor.</p> <p>Worldwide, there are 475 Confucius Institutes, and 120 in the United States. In Alabama, the Confucius Institute at Troy University is the only such institute to have a statewide mission of expanding economic development opportunities between China and Alabama companies.</p> <p>In addition to Secretary Canfield's address, Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange brought welcoming remarks, and Dothan Mayor Mike Schmitz spoke on China-Wiregrass initiatives.</p> <p>A variety of performances dotted the celebration, performed by Chinese students, as well as students from LAMP, who provided a poetry reading and a Tai Chi demonstration.</p> <div style="width:40%;"> <br /> <img src="http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/03/_images/chinese-new-year-thumb.jpg" alt="chinese-new-year-thumb"/> <br /> <div> <br />Troy University Chancellor Dr. Jack Hawkins Jr. is congratulated by Alabama Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield on receiving the World Confucius Institute's Individual Performance of Excellence Award during a Feb. 26 Confucius Institute at Troy University Chinese New Year Appreciation Banquet in Montgomery.

It was a descriptor used frequently Thursday night in Gold Room of Whitley Hall on the Montgomery Campus as students and community residents caught a glimpse of what it is like to face poverty.</p> <p>Presented by Troy University and Alabama Possible, a statewide nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing poverty and its root causes, took participants through four, 15-minute "weeks" and presented them with the challenges that many area families living in poverty experience every day.</p> <p>"I thought it was a very interesting activity," said Andrea Lane, a graduate student in TROY's clinical mental health counseling program. "The things we had to deal with were frustrating and demonstrated what people facing poverty would actually experience."</p> <p>The cumulative effect of the month took its toll on many of the participants, including Lane.</p> <p>"It wasn't just figuring out how you were going to deal with one thing. Circumstances just built up, one on top of the other, and really made you understand that these situations can put people in positions to do things they otherwise wouldn't consider doing," Lane said.</p> <p>TROY freshman Sam Moody experienced the simulation from a slightly different viewpoint. The Montgomery resident and graduate of Alabama Christian Academy served the roll of caregiver at one of 15 stations circling the room.</p> <p>"It made me aware of the struggle that people in poverty face. For some, it was even a struggle to travel to somewhere in order to receive help," Moody said. "This is reality for a lot of people. I worked at Interfaith Services. I gave one woman $45 to pay her gas bill so that she could heat her home, but then she was faced with how she would meet her other responsibilities. I actually had to kick some people out of the homeless shelter because they had been there longer than was allowed. It was a very difficult thing to do."</p> <p>Those lessons and the many others learned by participants is what Jonathan Cellon, Coordinator for Service Learning and Civic Engagement at TROY, hoped would be the result of the simulation.</p> <p>"I think this exercise helped to raise awareness of the challenges that individuals and families in poverty face every day," he said. "Many of these challenges are interrelated. For many, it is a struggle even getting to and from work, but if you aren't able to get to work or get to work on time, you might lose your job. Then the problems mount even higher."</p> <p>Kristina Scott, executive director of Alabama Possible, said the simulation was created by the Missouri Association for Community Action in an effort to help participants understand the challenges faced by low-income families and individuals.</p> <p>"Our program gives participants a chance to experience the grinding realities of poverty," Scott said, noting that several participants in Thursday's simulation commented about the anxiousness they felt by the mock circumstances presented. "This simulation is based on real-life scenarios and expenses, and it gives participants a chance to understand why it is so hard to 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps.'"</p> <p>According to the 2014 Alabama Possible Poverty Data Sheet, nearly 900,000 Alabamians, including 300,000 children, live below the federal poverty line. Many more hover just above the poverty line, which is an annual income of about $23,000 for a family of four. In Montgomery County along, 21.7 percent of residents live below the poverty line, including 31.3 percent of all children under the age of 18.</p> <p>"Alabama Possible seeks to end poverty in our state through volunteer service, philanthropy and advocacy," Scott said. "We hope that participants in this simulation will ask themselves 'What am I passionate about?' We aren't looking to tell them what they should do, but rather asking simply that they do something to help."</p> <div style="width:40%;"> <br /> <img src="http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/02/_images/poverty1-thumb.jpg" alt="poverty1-thumb"/> <br /> <div> <br />TROY freshman Sam Moody and graduate student Princess Cuthrell try to provide assistance to a participant in Thursday's Poverty Simulation on the University's Montgomery Campus.

Sixteen brothers of Alpha Tau Omega will participate in the five-day walk, fourteen for the first time.</p> <p>All proceeds raised from this year's walk will be donated to Wounded Warrior Project and Jeep Sullivan's Outdoor Adventures. The organization offers wounded warriors, veterans, and first responders an opportunity to refresh and recharge while enjoying nature.</p> <p>"We are honored to have the opportunity to work with the Wounded Warrior Project," said Logan Wagner, 2015 Walk Hard director. "This is a great opportunity to sacrifice our time to honor and help others who have given so much of their lives for our country and for our freedom."</p> <p>The inaugural Walk Hard hike was held in 2010, to raise scholarships for children with juvenile diabetes to attend Camp Seale Harris. Walk Hard co-founder and TROY graduate Kyle Crabtree said it has been neat to see how the event has transformed since its conception.</p> <p>"I'm very proud of the chapter for creating an event that means so much to them personally," Crabtree said. "Several of the brothers currently in the chapter are in the military and working with Wounded Warrior Project resonates with the Army presence in southeast Alabama."</p> <p>The event has become a signature event for the chapter and receives annual recognition from the national Alpha Tau Omega organization. The walk raises money with no overhead costs, allowing all proceeds to be donated directly to the philanthropic organization.</p> <p>Anyone interested in donating to Walk Hard 2015 can give through the fraternity's GoFundMe site, <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/atowalkhard" target="_blank">www.gofundme.com/atowalkhard</a>.

Long School of Music's inventory to 29 Steinway pianos, including the first two Sterling Steinways ever produced.</p> <p>Troy University began the All-Steinway initiative in fall 2013, with a formal announcement of the effort taking place last March. All-Steinway Schools are institutions that have only Steinways or Steinway-designed pianos such as Boston or Essex in their inventory. Troy University is the first Steinway University in the state of Alabama and the 17th in the world to feature only Steinway pianos.</p> <p>Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr., Chancellor of Troy University, Dr. Larry Blocher, Dr. Jean Laliberte, Dr. Don Jeffrey, Walter Givhan, Dr. Earl Ingram, Dr. Jim Bookout and Dr. Hui-Ting Yang have been the driving force behind this accomplishment.</p> <p>Trucks delivering the pianos are set to arrive on Monday, and the University will officially recognize the All-Steinway moniker with a special, by-invitation event on Tuesday night, featuring all of the pianos together in the band rehearsal site at John M. Long Hall.

Roberts" court case where six plaintiffs sued for being punished for the use of social media platform Facebook's "Like" button, including a Virginia deputy sheriff who was fired for "liking" the Facebook page of his sheriff's political opponent. The professors conducted original research in how people use Facebook and what they believe they are communicating when using the "Like" button on Facebook, and whether or not their speech should be protected by the U.S. Constitution.</p> <p>"More astonishing than the deputy being fired for clicking the 'Like' button, was the statement by the presiding judge, Judge Raymond Jackson, that 'simply liking a Facebook page' is not even speech," Sarapin said.</p> <p>In May 2013, the sufficient speech aspect of Jackson's decision was reversed on appeal, declaring that the use of the "Like" button is sufficient speech to be protected by the First Amendment.</p> <p>The study found that judges do consider the public's opinions when making their decisions, and that survey respondents who were most certain about who would view their "Like" message also believed that those viewers would know what was being communicated.</p> <p>"In other words, as awareness of one's audience increases, so, too, does the belief that the receivers of the message will understand one's intended meaning," Sarapin said.</p> <p>Other major findings of the study included:</p> <ul> <li>A significant positive association between survey respondents' belief they are communicating a message by clicking "Like" and the belief that message should be protected speech;</li> <li>The more Facebook users believe they are communicating a message by clicking "Like," the more they will believe their audience will understand what they are saying;</li> <li>As compared to Facebook users who do not "Like" political messages, those who do were significantly more likely to believe that their posts should be protected speech;</li> <li>Two-thirds of the respondents agreed on the meaning of a "Like;" and <br />81.6 percent of respondents believed that "Liking" something is communicating a message.</li> </ul> Mon, 09 Feb 2015 11:18:37 -0600 173AEB47-3780-4104-BCE0-65A533468345 news@troy.edu Harper challenges Leadership Conference participants to live with passion, reason and courage http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/02/harper-challenges-leadership-conference-participants-to-live-with-passion-reason-and-courage.html <p><strong>TROY</strong> - Passion, reason and courage are needed to transform the world. That was the message of award-winning actor and bestselling author Hill Harper during Friday night's opening session of the Leadership Conference Celebrating African American History Month at Troy University.</p> <p>Launched in 2002, the Conference is co-sponsored by the University and the City of Troy and seeks to promote dialogue that fosters multicultural collaboration and equip diverse leaders with the tools to better serve their organizations and communities. The theme of this year's conference is "A Century of Achievement: A Salute to African American History and Culture."</p> <p>"Most of us live lives that are much smaller than we were intended to live because we lack passion; we lack energy," Harper told the crowd gathered in Sartain Hall on the Troy Campus. "If we see an issue or a problem that needs to be changed, energy is required to change it. There is potential energy within all of us. We must turn that potential energy into radiant energy - the energy of light. We have the potential to shine light on the injustice in the world and bring light to the places of darkness."</p> <p>Individuals also must be willing to turn their potential energy into kinetic energy - the energy of action, Harper said.</p> <p>"We must go out and do something to make a difference," he said. "Kinetic energy was what Rosa Parks used when she sat in that seat. It is what Dr. King used when he marched. It is what John Lewis used when he walked across that bridge. Kinetic energy - the energy of action - is what is required to bring about change, and it is already in each one of us waiting to be put to work."</p> <p>Harper also encouraged participants to live with reason.</p> <p>"Be an active architect of your own life. Have a blueprint or a plan for what you want to do," he said. "You can have all the energy in the world but without a plan or direction that energy will be wasted. A lot of people will have a plan of what they want to accomplish in their heads, but by keeping your plan in your head you will not be accountable to yourself. Map out your plan, your blueprint and hold yourself accountable to achieving what you want to accomplish."</p> <p>Part of the process of developing a blueprint for your life, Harper said, relies on courage.</p> <p>"Courage is not the opposite of fear," he said. "The root word of courage translates to mean heart. We must ask ourselves: what do we care about? What's in our heart? Once we determine that, we can formulate a blueprint, hold ourselves accountable and turn the potential energy within ourselves into radiant and kinetic energy that enables us to change our lives, our families, our communities, our country and our world."</p> <p>Best known for his award-winning portrayal of "Dr. Sheldon Hawkes" on the hit CBS drama "CSI: NY" and as "Calder Michaels" on USA Network's spy drama "Covert Affairs." Harper is a magna cum laude graduate of Brown University and a cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School. He also holds a master's degree from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.</p> <p>His bestseller "Letters to a Young Brother" was winner of two awards by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and named "Best Book for Young Adults" by the American Library Association. His "Letters to a Young Sister" was a New York Times bestseller, and his credits also include three other books.</p> <p>The Leadership Conference continues on Saturday with plenary sessions for both students and adults and a closing keynote address by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Frank Ponds, a native of Autaugaville who has served as commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3 since 2013.</p> <div style="width:40%;"> <br /> <img src="http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/02/_images/harper-thumb.jpg" alt="harper-thumb"/> <br /></div> Mon, 09 Feb 2015 11:17:00 -0600 8337E35C-3646-4972-83F4-0EEA13F9F69C news@troy.edu 'Treat your legacy with care,' Admiral Ponds tells Leadership Conference participants http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/02/treat-your-legacy-with-care-admiral-ponds-tells-leadership-conference-participants.html <p><strong>TROY</strong> - U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Fernandez "Frank" Ponds encouraged those gathered for the closing session of the Leadership Conference Celebrating African American History Month to give great consideration to their legacy.</p> <p>The conference, co-sponsored by Troy University and the City of Troy, concluded Saturday on the University's Troy Campus with a closing luncheon that featured an awards presentation to two TROY seniors and Ponds' keynote address.</p> <p>"In the corporate world and in the military, we have a concept in which we put great stock - value proposition," Ponds said. "Stated simply, your value proposition is what you are known or recognized for. Today, I challenge you to step up and ask yourself, 'what is your value proposition?' What do you want to be known for, recognized for and, ultimately, remembered for?"</p> <p>Ponds reminded conference participants that actions and not merely words send as much powerful messages to others. He challenged participants to treat their legacy with great care and consideration.</p> <p>"Your legacy is a lot like what you put on the internet, it is always out there for all to see," Ponds said. "Be mindful of what you say and do and what you leave behind for others to see and remember."</p> <p>Ponds challenged the young people in the audience to "keep dreaming."</p> <p>"Don't ever stop dreaming, but don't stop with just a dream," he said. "Have a plan, follow that plan and take the action necessary to assure that your dreams come true."</p> <p>Ponds, a native of Autaugaville, is commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3, assuming the post in 2013. His personal decorations include the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit (three), Meritorious Service Medal (five), Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (three), Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and various service and campaign awards.</p> <p>Earlier during the session, Troy University seniors Courtney Hunter, an elementary education major from Eufaula, and Ben Martin, an economics major from Tuscaloosa, were honored with Student Leadership Awards for their work and example in the classroom, on campus and in the community.</p> <p>The Conference opened Friday night with a keynote address by award-winning actor and bestselling author Hill Harper and continued Saturday morning with plenary sessions for students and adults featuring Sheyann Webb-Christburg, a Civil Rights activist from Montgomery; Patricia Barnes, founder of Sister Schubert; Dr. Carl Cunningham, Jr., director of Multicultural Student Affairs at the University of South Alabama; Mitch Steed, founder of Physiques by SUSO of Troy; and Dr. Jasmine Younge, founder and chief operating officer of Havah-Younge, Inc. of Atlanta.</p> <div style="width:40%;"> <br /> <img src="http://troy.edu/news/articles/2015/02/_images/Navy-Rear-Admiral-Frank-Ponds-thumb.jpg" alt="Navy-Rear-Admiral-Frank-Ponds-thumb"/> <br /></div> Mon, 09 Feb 2015 11:15:39 -0600 37E6039B-15FD-4F5D-8797-ADB4547F49DE news@troy.edu
