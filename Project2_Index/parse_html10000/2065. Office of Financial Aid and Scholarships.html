Home » Financial Aid and Scholarships To Apply For Financial Aid (Grants, Loans and Scholarships) You must complete one of two Financial Aid Applications beginning January 1st each year. Complete your application by March 2. If you miss this deadline, you might miss out on eligible funds! FAFSA (click for more information) All students must apply or reapply (renew) yearly for financial aid. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the application that most students need to complete. To be eligible to file the FAFSA, students must: Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen Be in a degree-seeking program Dream Application (click for more information) The other method of applying for Financial Aid is the California Dream Application. This application became available following the passage of two, California Assembly bills, AB 130 and AB 131. Together, these bills became known as the California Dream Act. The California Dream Act allows certain, undocumented students to receive State and University Financial Aid. To be eligible to file the California Dream Application, students must: Not be eligible to file the FAFSA Be eligible for AB 540 as determined by the Office of Admissions Be in a degree-seeking program Have attended a California high school for 3 or more years and have  graduated or attained the equivalent of a high school diploma Have registered or currently be enrolled at an accredited institution of higher education in California Have filed or will file an affidavit (as required by individual institutions) stating that they will apply for legal residency as soon as possible May not be non-immigrants holding a valid lettered non-immigrant visa            (Source: The College & Financial Aid Guide for: AB540 Undocumented Immigrant Students) Bronco Scholarship Application (BSA) (click for more information) Scholarships are available through Cal Poly Pomona as well as from organizations, businesses, and community groups that are external to the university. Scholarships are generally awarded on the basis of academic merit, leadership, talent, and/or community service. Financial need is a criterion for some but not all scholarships. Eligibility criteria, application procedures, and deadlines may vary by program. For Cal Poly Pomona scholarships from the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships, the academic colleges, and many campus departments, please complete the Bronco Scholarship Application (BSA). For more scholarship opportunities and information about scholarships in general, please visit http://www.csupomona.edu/~financial-aid/types-of-aid/scholarships/index.shtml  After Filing Your Application (click for more information) Approximately 2-3 weeks after you complete the FAFSA or Dream Application, you will receive your Student Aid Report (SAR). Carefully review your status and, if you need to make any corrections, follow the instructions. Our office will receive your information as long as Cal Poly Pomona is listed in the School Selection section. Check your Student Center in BroncoDirect. Here you can track your financial aid, as well as manage other university activities. The To Do List, which lets you know what is required to complete your financial aid process, can be found on the right side of your BroncoDirect, Student Center. Tips Here are a few key things to remember when applying for Financial Aid: Only one application is required, either the FAFSA or Dream Application, not both. If the FAFSA application priority date (March 2nd) is missed, students should apply as soon as possible to be considered for the financial aid that is still available. It is recommended that you (if you are required to do so) and your parents complete your taxes before filing the FAFSA; however, if you or your  parents have not filed your tax return, submit the FAFSA using estimated figures. After you and your parents have filed your taxes, you can make corrections to your FAFSA as needed. If there are errors on your FAFSA, our office might not receive your FAFSA. Be sure to check for errors and make corrections as needed. Even if you mark the “Work Study” box on your FAFSA, you will still need to apply for Work Study by completing an Information Update Form and submitting it to our office. Remember, there are two Cal Polys. Be sure to choose California Polytechnic University, Pomona. (If you choose Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, our office will not receive your FAFSA.) Cal Poly Pomona’s school code is 001144. The Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships  We are here to assist you with obtaining the finances you need to complete the degree you set out to achieve.
