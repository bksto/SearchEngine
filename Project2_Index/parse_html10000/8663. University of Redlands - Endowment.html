David Elton Trueblood (1900-1994) The long-term financial strength and vitality of the University is based on the continued growth of the University’s endowment.  Endowment serves many purposes. It underwrites scholarships and loans, faculty teaching and research, departmental support, and special projects. It helps all students by making it possible to set tuition at a level below what would be necessary to cover the true cost of a Redlands education.  Because our endowment is invested for long-term growth, it gives Redlands a generous measure of financial stability today, tomorrow and for all time. At many universities and colleges, the size of the endowment is about institutional prestige and less about the students served by the gifts.  At Redlands, growing our endowment is very focused—we want to provide the best possible experience for our students by ensuring the quality of the education.  You can help.  Your gift to the endowment will have an impact today, tomorrow and for all time. Whether through a current gift or one planned through your estate, making the decision to invest in our endowment is one of the most generous and forward-thinking ways possible to help generations of students for years to come.   Endowment ensures As with gifts to support capital projects, a gift to create an endowment fund typically is larger and paid in installments. Depending on the type of endowment created, certain minimum gifts are necessary. These minimums range from as little as $20,000 for a Redlands Fund endowment up to $2 million or more for an endowed faculty chair.  Endowment FAQs  For more information about you can make a gift to ensure the gift of a Redlands education for all time, please contact Ray Watts, CFRE, Associate Vice President for Development at ray_watts@redlands.edu or (909) 748-8358 Home Connect Bulldog Showcase Professional Development Maroon & Grey Student Ambassadors Regional Alumni Chapters For Parents Traditions Serve Alumni Awards Nominations Annual Bulldogs in Service Hire a Bulldog President’s Circle Leadership Committee Tag Week Give Make a Gift Now The Power of the Redlands Fund President's Circle Leadership Committee Leadership Giving Endowment Planned Giving Town & Gown Scholarships for Inland Empire Students Meet the Development Team Join Bulldog Bench Events All Events Alumni & Friends Travel Town & Gown Events Johnston Events Alumni Founders Weekend 2015 Town & Gown Town & Gown Join and Support Town & Gown Awards of Distinction Calendar of Events History and Governance Scholarship Endowment Contact Us Johnston Alumni Activities and Hub The Coz McNooz Newsletter Support Johnston Alumni Assoc.
