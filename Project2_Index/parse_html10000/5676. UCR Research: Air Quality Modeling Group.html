Researchers at UC Riverside tackle air quality issues with the goal of improving the health of not just those who live in the Inland Area and Southern California, but of all people whose livelihoods are affected by polluted air. Air Quality Modeling Group UC Riverside scientists in the Air Quality Modeling Group are estimating the emissions of particulate matter from paved roads in a program funded by the California Air Resources Board. These types of emissions are believed to contribute about 30 percent to the total emissions in major urban areas such as Los Angeles. Our scientists are attempting to determine the origins of particulate emissions from paved roads. The program is one of four major areas of research for the group.
