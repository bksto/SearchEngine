Building on its nearly four centuries of rigorous intellectual inquiry, Harvard must embrace these purposes in new ways. In all it undertakes, Harvard must reinforce the significance of transcending the immediate and instrumental to explore and understand what humans have thought, done, and been, and thus to imagine where they might best seek to go. Nine miniature manuscript books, six by Charlotte Brontë and three by Patrick Branwell Brontë, are part of the collections at Houghton Library. The library repaired, rehoused, and digitized the nearly 200-year-old books, which provide valuable insight into the genius of the Brontës. Aspiration in Action The Art of Learning and Teaching The approximately 250,000 works of art in the newly reopened Harvard Art Museums’ collections are readily available online, but now Harvard students, faculty, and the general public can study the works more closely in the Art Study Center. International Bridges to Justice: Where Change Begins The experiences Karen Tse MDiv ’00 had at Harvard Divinity School inspired her to found International Bridges to Justice, a nongovernmental organization that works to enforce due process rights and eliminate torture around the world. Sharing Our Treasures Harvard’s library system constitutes one of the world’s richest depositories of human culture, with holdings rangings from third-century BC Greek language papyri to reel-to-reel tapes of Joan Baez playing in Harvard Square. Footnotes To Footlights The American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) is one of the country’s premier theater companies, producing Tony Award–winning shows and catalyzing discourse, interdisciplinary collaboration, and creative exchange among a wide range of students, faculty, and artists. Learning From Luminaries The flourishing visiting artist programs across the University give students and faculty opportunities to interact with luminaries from stage, concert hall, screen, and studio. Designing a Better World The studio method of teaching is at the center of design and planning education at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and option studios afford students a chance to work with real-world clients on complex design problems—often under the tutelage of industry leaders. Forgotten Jewish Fighters Stories of patriotism, revenge, and profound loss abound in Pusey Library exhibit. Ghosts in the Machines The history of the digital revolution touches our hearts and heads, says Walter Isaacson AB ’74.
