To be eligible to establish residency for the purpose of attending a California community college, applicants must be citizens of the United States or legal aliens with an immigration status which allows them to establish domicile according to the laws of California. The regulations regarding alien students are extensive and cannot be reprinted here.

Students eligible to establish residency who have lived in California for less than two (2) years prior to the start of the semester for which they are applying, must clearly demonstrate the following: a. Intent to make California their permanent residency at least one year before the start of the semester. (T5 54024) b. Physical presence in California for at least one year immediately before the start of the semester. (T5 45022) c. Financial independence from anyone who is not a California resident. (several requirements must be met in this area) (T5 45032) One-Year Waiting Period: (T5 54028) The residence period which a student must meet to be classified as a resident does not begin to run until the student is present in California and has manifested clear intent to become a California Resident.

When the residence of a minor student is derived from the parent, the durational requirement (one year in California before the start of the semester for which they are applying). A minor whose parents are not living and who does not have a legal guardian may establish his or her own residence. EXCEPTION Exceptions to the above guidelines will be made under certain circumstances. If a student would otherwise be classified as a nonresident, but fits within one of the following exceptions, he or she may be granted resident classification provided he or she has resided in California for one year (prior to the start of the term for which he/she is applying) with the intent of establishing residence (documentation required): a) A student who was not an adult for more than one year before the start of the semester may add the amount of time lived in California prior to his or her eighteenth birthday (provided the student’s parent was a California resident during the period), if any, to the length of residence in California since that date to obtain the durational requirement of one year. b) Adult aliens who are in the process of adjusting their status to a permanent resident or who have been lawfully admitted as a permanent resident for one year and one prior to the beginning date of the semester (documentation required) and who has resided in California for one year. c) A student 19 years of age or older who can document refugee or asylee status with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) (dated one year and one day prior to the beginning date of the semester) and who has resided in California for one year (students younger that 19 years of age should review the first item above). d) An adult alien who is in the process of adjusting visa status to, or possesses one of the following visas: A, E, G, H, I, H-4, I, K, L, O-1, R, or T dated at least one year and one day prior to the beginning date of the semester and who meets California residence criteria. e) A student who is a minor (under the age of 18) and who, immediately before enrolling at a California educational institution, has lived with and was under the continuous direct care and control under legal guardianship for at least two years of any adult or adults (other than a parent) who had established residence in California at least one year and one day prior to beginning date of the semester (documentation required).
