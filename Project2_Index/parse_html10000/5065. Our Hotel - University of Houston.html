Hilton College – San Antonio Conrad N. Hilton College – Lima Global Hospitality Master's Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor Gourmet Night Sugar Land Wine & Food Affair Cougar Grounds Barron’s Restaurant Our Hotel One of more than 530 Hilton Hotels worldwide, the Hilton University of Houston serves as the primary teaching facility for the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management. The hotel, first built in 1975, underwent a $12.5-million renovation and reopened as a “new” hotel in April 2010. The extensive renovation combines contemporary style with authentic Houston hospitality, giving guests a vibrant, warm and welcoming home away from home and allowing hospitality students to gain hands-on experience in guest service, hotel operations and banquet and restaurant service. The Hilton University of Houston features 86 guest rooms. And with 25,000 square feet of flexible banquet space—including seven meeting rooms and three ballrooms with capacities ranging from 10 to 600 people—it’s the ideal destination for meetings, banquets, receptions and special events. Additionally, business casual dining is available at Eric’s Restaurant, just off the hotel lobby. The Fred Parks Boardroom offers a stylish alternative venue for breakfast, lunch or dinner meetings and features a remarkable wine collection. The boardroom can accommodate customized menus with wine pairings for up to 28 people. The hotel's prime location—just three miles from downtown Houston and 10 minutes from William P. Hobby Airport—gives guests quick access to the world-class restaurants, exciting sports activities and cultural arts events that make Houston a top destination for business and leisure travelers alike. It also is the ideal hotel and meeting place for potential students, faculty, conference attendees, UH sports fans and other visitors to the University of Houston campus.
