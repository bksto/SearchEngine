We strongly encourage students and their families to come to our beautiful campus to participate in the many options we offer for prospective students to observe campus life, talk with staff and students, get to know our community better, and have all of your important questions answered. Daily visits to WPI last just over two hours and include an information session—conducted by an Admissions staff member and Admissions student intern—and a campus tour led by a WPI student. Read more about weekday visit options, and please register in advance of your arrival if you plan to join us. We also offer additional opportunities to visit: Open Houses Saturday Visits Personal Interviews …Or we'll come to you… Although we strongly recommend a campus visit, we realize that’s not always possible. Our Admissions staff travels to various parts of the country to meet students close to their homes and to give information sessions about WPI and to conduct interviews.   Personal Interviews Evening Information Sessions College Fairs   See Also Directions to Campus Area Lodging Campus Maps Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Academic Programs WPI At-a-Glance Living at WPI Your Perspective Applying to WPI Visit with Us Meet the Team Information Sessions & Campus Tours Saturday Visits Open Houses Personal Interviews Office Hours and Parking BEANS Virtual Tour Online College Fairs Pre-College Opportunities Request Information Admissions Calendar + There are currently no events in the calendar.
