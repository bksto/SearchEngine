To book a group tour for a domestic group, please contact the Visitor Information Services Private Tour Coordinator at (650) 725-3335. Visiting international groups must email visitorinfo@stanford.edu to book a group tour. Because of the large demand for tours, visiting domestic school groups are given priority. A limited number of private tours can be accommodated in any given day, so groups are encouraged to call well in advance of the date they are hoping to visit. If you are coming to campus with a group of 8 or less, you may join one of our Campus Walking Tours — no reservation is required. Additional Information: All tours are conducted in English, and visiting groups with non-English speaking participants must provide their own interpreter(s).

Prospective Students: Planning a Spring Visit? We strongly encourage prospective students planning a visit to do so either before March 14 or after April 7 in order to maximize the value of the visit. These are our busiest weeks of the year, and they coincide with Stanford's final exams and our own Spring Break — large crowds are thus paired with limited offerings and greatly reduced tour guide staffing. To truly get a sense of what Stanford is like, come during an academic quarter in order to sit in on classes, enjoy smaller tour groups, and take part in special interest tours and programs. For more information, please contact us at (650) 723-2560 during business hours. Tour visit policies All campus tours that are not organized by Stanford, consisting of groups of nine (9) or more people, must reserve a time slot and follow Stanford’s tour visit policies.
