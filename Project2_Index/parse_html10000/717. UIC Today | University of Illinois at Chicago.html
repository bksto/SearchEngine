As one of the top 200 research-funded institutions in the world, UIC faculty discover the things that others teach. Choose from 15 academic colleges including the UIC College of Medicine-the largest in the nation-which educates one in six Illinois physicians. With nearly 2,574 instructional faculty members, there is one faculty member to every 11 students, which allows for a more personal learning experience. What's more, 75 percent of tenured faculty members teach undergraduate courses and 83 percent of full-time instructional faculty have earned a PhD or equivalent. But it's not all work and no play at UIC... Our 16,911 undergrads and 10,669 graduate and professional students make up one of the most diverse student bodies in the United States. Whether living in residence halls, near campus or commuting, you'll find there's always something interesting going on, from social events, clubs, sororities and fraternities, to two state-of-the-art fitness centers, and more-not to mention everything Chicago has to offer just minutes away. And at UIC, we take our sports seriously. The UIC Flames compete in 18 NCAA Division 1 sports and have won a total of 38 conference championships. There's a wide range of intramural teams and sports clubs for students to join.
