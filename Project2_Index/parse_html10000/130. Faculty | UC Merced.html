Whether they are just starting out or have held their Ph.D.s for decades, UC Merced faculty members are making advancements in solar energy, computer science, stem-cell research and other biomedical fields, artificial intelligence, cognitive science; big-data analysis, climate change, air quality, water resources, materials science, archaeology, political science and many other subjects that enhance the campus’s collective resume and have lasting effects on the world. Schools and Divisions UC Merced has three academic schools: the School of Engineering; the School of Natural Sciences; and the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts; as well as a robust and growing Graduate Division. Faculty members can affiliate with the campus’s research powerhouses, the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS); the Health Sciences Research Institute (HSRI); or the Sierra Nevada Research Institute (SNRI); as well as an expanding list of centers within each school.    Administration and Research Support This growing campus demands many resources to assist faculty members not only in making UC Merced their home, but in promoting and supporting the important research being conducted here. The Chancellor's Office, the Office of the Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, the office of Academic Personnel; and the Academic Senate are geared toward faculty members’ administrative needs and concerns. The University of California has a three-pronged mission: research, teaching and community service. For the first part of the mission, the Office of Research; the office of Sponsored Projects; the office of Compliance and Integrity; and Development Services help faculty members pursue and promote their research.    Instruction Professors at any UC campus have a lot of plates spinning simultaneously, including teaching. But the second part of the UC’s mission is critical, so faculty members can find a host of online resources to help them stay on track, including the Academic Calendar; each semester’s class schedule; a listing of deadlines; the campus’s academic policies; the project collaboration and courseware system UCMCrops; the Center for Research on Teaching Excellence; and information on teaching freshmen.    Faculty Service and Support Whether a professor is new to UC Merced or has been here since the beginning, this campus is evolving, as is its list of services for faculty members. The Information Technology department can help with technical issues, while Business and Financial Services is responsible for the campus's core business processes, including accounting, contracts and grants accounting, payroll, campus cashiering, purchasing, equipment management, risk management and tax and travel services. Facilities Management is responsible for the buildings and grounds, including UC Merced’s commitment to sustainability. Environmental Health and Safety supports the faculty to ensure a safe and healthful workplace and to manage hazardous materials in an environmentally sound manner. EH&S offers lab safety training, as well. University Communications is here to tell the stories of UC Merced, whether on the campus homepage, through press releases and other media pitches, or by helping promote programs, research, events or services. Communications produces a campus magazine designed to spread the word about the important work happening at UC Merced, as well as offering full design, editing and photography services and a talented Web team that can assist with sites.
