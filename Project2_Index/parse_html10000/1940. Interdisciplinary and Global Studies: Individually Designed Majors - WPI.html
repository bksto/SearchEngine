These Individually Designed Majors (IDM) may be created in any area of study in which WPI’s academic strengths can support such a program, and in which career goals exist. Many combinations of technical and non-technical study are possible. Students wishing to pursue an IDM should discuss their ideas with their academic advisor, then consult Professor Richard Vaz, who along with other faculty members, will determine the feasibility of the proposed program and arrange for its evaluation. Learn more about how to initiate and establish an IDM.   See Also Undergraduate Studies Academics Interdisciplinary and Global Studies Division About IGSD Undergraduate Programs Global Projects Program Interactive Qualifying Project Individually Designed Majors Faculty Research Mission Resources Facebook Follow us on Facebook Contact Interdisciplinary & Global Studies Division Project Center Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5547 Fax: +1-508-831-5485 global@wpi.edu Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
