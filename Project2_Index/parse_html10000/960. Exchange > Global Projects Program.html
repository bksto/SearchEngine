Exchange Program Having a better understanding and appreciation of other nations and cultures will be critical to uncovering and developing global solutions and advances. WPI offers students a wide range of opportunities to broaden their academic and cultural perspectives through international study. Our program is designed to allow students to work directly with foreign students, faculty members, and residents of the community. WPI students gain a better feel for the local culture by residing with the students from the host institution and by taking advantage of additional travel during their stay. This will help tomorrow’s engineers and professionals contribute to a brighter future around the world. Exchanges with universities in Germany, Morocco, and Switzerland are currently offered.
