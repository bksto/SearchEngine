Teaching Evaluation Process Overview Students, faculty and staff all have a part in making the evaluation period a success every term. Teaching Evaluations Quick Reference Guide Update Templates/Add Questions When core templates need creating or modifications, instructors working with their evaluation coordinators can design their core evaluation templates by selecting the questions from our Question Catalog A maximum of 30 rating questions and 5 open-ended comment questions is the limit. Contact ro.evaluations@umich.edu with new template and question requests, or changes. The Registrar’s Office – Evaluations staff will modify existing templates or create a new evaluation templates for you. Information to include in the email: Subject or Academic Org code Template number (if it's just a change) or type 'New Template' Description of the change including a description of the text before the change and after the change would be helpful Your contact information (email and/or phone) in case there are any questions with the request After the new templates are setup, department evaluation coordinators will be able or order evaluations using the new templates. Check/Manage Orders Department staff can check their orders by using the Mpathways > Curriculum Management > Teaching Evaluation Summary page. Use the page’s download feature to create a spreadsheet with all the evaluations for the previous term or year. It is a good practice to refer to last year’s or last term’s evaluation orders when creating orders for a new term. Another good practice is to wait until after the 3rd week of the term before ordering evaluations to minimize evaluation problems due to instructor changes in curriculum set up. Instructors can check to see if an evaluation has been ordered from either Wolverine Access > Faculty Business > Faculty Center or from their Teaching Questionnaire page under their workspace in CTools. If an evaluation was not ordered for your class, then contact your department’s evaluation coordinator. In most cases, if the department allows it, primary instructors can customize their evaluations by adding questions from the Wolverine Access > Faculty Center page. Not all questions are a good fit for our question catalog. The CTools 'Forums' or 'Polls' tools may be better suited handle certain questions. The information for using these tools is online under CTools > Help. Teaching Evaluation Reports Reporting Timeline Report Types Medians and Quartiles Improving Teaching — Strategies and Resources Requesting Evaluation Reports and Data Reporting Timeline Typically, students complete evaluations during the last full week of classes. The evaluations then close before the start of examinations. After the majority of final evaluations for the term close, CTools interfaces that data back to Mpathways. Report access is turned on after a brief processing period. Instructors can access the reports after the grades for the class has been submitted in Wolverine Access > Faculty Business > Faculty Center. The Individual Response Report is deleted from the system at the end of the following term. See the report availability datasheet for details. Report Types There are three standard Teaching Evaluation reports: Instructor with Comments Report - a combined summary report that includes both quantitative ratings and student comments; Instructor Report - a summary that tabulates all quantitative ratings on a single page; Individual Response Report - a detailed report that displays individual student ratings and comments. Medians and Quartiles The Instructor Report and Instructor with Comments Report provide university wide and school/college wide medians along with the medians for the class. The reported medians are calculated by finding the median from a frequency distribution. These two summary reports also provide quartiles that allow instructors to compare their rankings with other similar courses university wide and within their schools/colleges for questions 1 through 4. Improving Teaching — Strategies and Resources Resources to assist you with interpreting or making use of your results: Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) – Faculty Consultations Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) – Teaching Strategies & Resources Requesting Evaluation Reports and Data To obtain Teaching Evaluations prior to Fall 2008 or to request department or school/college wide Teaching Evaluation data in different formats (for example, Business Objects reports, Excel spreadsheets, comma separated values (*.csv) files) contact ro.evaluations@umich.edu.

Increasing Response Rates Individual instructors are often best situated to increase the response rates for their evaluations. Tell students directly how much you value their feedback. Let them know how you have incorporated past feedback into your courses. Assure them that all evaluations are anonymous and that instructors do not see results until after final grades are submitted. Use the real time response rate feature on the CTools Evaluations Dashboard to keep track of your class specific response rates on a day-to-day basis during the evaluation period. Let your students know what percentage of the class has responded and that you would like to get feedback from everyone. Add the 'Evaluate This Class' tool to your course site. This tool allows you to add a direct link to the Evaluations Dashboard, where students fill out their evaluations, from your course site.  It also gives you the option to provide a personalized message to students.  For more information, see the CTools Teaching Questionnaire Online Help. Include evaluation period dates, if appropriate, in your course syllabus or class schedule for future terms.  See the Teaching Evaluation Calendar for important dates.
