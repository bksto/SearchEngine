One or more copies of most texbooks used at SBVC are available for in-Library use through the "Textbook Bank." In addition, the Library provides access to thousands of newpapers, magazines, e-books, journals and other materials supporting research. Enrolled students may request a password from the Reference Librarian or login to Blackboard (passwords are located on the bottom right-hand side of the screen) so that they can access these databases from their home computers. The Library also houses the campus' open computer laboratory, with over 100 personal computers and multi-media equipment available for student use in completing class assignments. Faculty librarians are available to help students find materials for term papers and other research assignments. Currently enrolled District students use their student ID's to check out Library materials.
