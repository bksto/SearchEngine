In the reading room you will find information and resources related to current exhibitions, you can bring a laptop and visit our online UAM Collections Kiosk, or peruse the UAM published exhibition catalogs, related books, posters and limited edition prints available for purchase. On behalf of the staff and board of the University Art Museum, the Museum's reading room was retitled the Charles and Elizabeth Brooks Reading and Resource Room in November 2011 in honor of their generous bequest to the museum. Charles and Elizabeth (Betty) Brooks were long-time members of the University Art Museum family. Retired educators, they devoted enormous time to the UAM Docent Council, giving tours, conducting research, and participating in museum events. Charles’ numerous insights and Betty’s unfailing enthusiasm were a constant source of support and inspiration for docents, staff, and visitors alike. © 2014 University Art Museum | CSULB STAY CONNECTED!
