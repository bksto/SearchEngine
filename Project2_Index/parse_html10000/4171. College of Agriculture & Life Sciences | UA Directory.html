As the primary land-grant component of the University, the College administers a variety of programs at its regional Agricultural Centers and engages in Cooperative Extension efforts with federal, state and county governments and agencies. Dean: Shane Burgess, Ph.D Research: The Arizona Agricultural Experiment Station is the research arm of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at the University of Arizona. Research is conducted in the various departments and schools on campus, as well as at Agricultural Centers throughout the state. These efforts enhance agriculture, the environment, our natural resource base, family and youth well-being and the development of local communities. Research generated through the Experiment Station underlies and supports the academic and extension programs. Cooperative Extension: Cooperative Extension, the outreach arm of The University of Arizona, is "taking the university to the people." Extension serves as a statewide network of knowledgeable faculty and staff that provides lifelong educational programs for all Arizonans. We are part of a nationwide educational network of scientists and educators who help people solve problems and put knowledge to use. Arizona Cooperative Extension provides a link between the university and the citizens of this state. Today's Cooperative Extension is many things to many people throughout Arizona. We teach in classes, seminars, and workshops; public presentations; with newspaper columns and stories; on radio; on the telephone; on the worldwide web; on video and through research-based publications. For over 80 years we have delivered educational programs to the people of Arizona. We are unique because our teaching efforts are made possible by a cooperative effort between the Federal Government, the University of Arizona's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and each of the counties we serve. With offices in all 15 counties and on five tribal reservations, we bring knowledge to people every day to enhance their work and enrich their lives. We are your window to the University.
