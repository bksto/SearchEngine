Skip to Content Merritt Writing Program Home The Karen Merritt Writing Program The Karen Merritt Writing Program is charged with training students "to convey information to and communicate and interact effectively with multiple audiences, using advanced skills in written and other modes of communication" (Guiding Principles for General Education at UC Merced).  We offer an array of courses in which students explore the art of critical thinking, craft their written expression, and address a variety of issues and audiences. Our students learn to use language actively, inventively, and responsibly by exchanging their work at all stages of their writing process while building cumulative portfolios. Our program's interdisciplinary approach to writing offers students the opportunity to reflect broadly on their college education as well as to consider a range of pre-professional and academic opportunities. General features of our classes: A maximum of twenty students per section; Teacher-student conferences; Frequent written and verbal feedback on writing and ideas; Interdisciplinary teaching, ranging from scientific literacy to aesthetic appreciation; Conversational and collaborative in-class projects; Portfolio projects that emphasize process and product in writing; and Detailed assessment of student learning and teaching effectiveness.   ***For complete course listings, click here.***   To report wireless connectivity problems in your classroom, please click here.         Home Program Learning Outcomes Courses People Directory Writing Resources Writing Minor Projects and Initiatives E-Portfolio Project Upcoming Events Faculty Resources Contact Us UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED | 5200 NORTH LAKE RD.
