Campus Sustainability Map Launched Blog post about campus sustainability map debut; comments can be submitted. Green Building Ratings Find out more about green buildings on campus. Sustainability Map: Map Points The sustainability map shows where to go on campus to see and experience how UC Davis is working towards meeting its sustainability goals. Depicted here, UC Davis' interactive Sustainability Map is a companion map to the Campus Map. The sustainability map can be used to find places or things on campus that express or demonstrate ways that UC Davis and the campus community are taking action towards creating a more sustainable future. Users can start with this introduction page and explore by clicking whole categories of points open (such as green buildings or recycling), or start with the map and by clicking the "Sustainability Information" link for each point jump to this page for more information. The map is not exhaustive and is a living document. The mapmakers hope that members of campus will suggest points and additional information through either emailing sustainability@ucdavis.edu, or submitting comments on the blog post about the map. Sustainable Transportation Transportation choices affect air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and land use planning. Find out how you can improve your commute, and campus progress toward transportation goals.

Open all fo the collections and habitats points on the map Land There are many beautiful gardens and landscapes on the UC Davis campus. The ones profiled below demonstrate progress towards more sustainable gardens and landscapes. Low-impact landscapes use less water and energy to maintain them, often through the use of native plants that are not pruned as frequently, drought-tolerant plants that require less water, and durable materials that require less intense maintenance. Many of these gardens and landscapes also have signage or other teaching elements to educate visitors about their lower impact features. Learn more about campus progress and what you can do.
