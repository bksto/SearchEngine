Jane Addams and Hull-House residents provided a wide range of services, including kindergarten and day care facilities for the children of working mothers, an employment bureau, an art gallery, libraries, and classes in English, citizenship, and more. In addition to local efforts, Hull-House supporters forged a powerful reform movement, launching the Immigrants' Protective League, the Juvenile Protective Association, the first juvenile court in the nation, and more. Through their efforts, the Illinois Legislature enacted protective legislation for women and children in 1893. Throughout her life, Jane Addams actively supported the campaign for women's suffrage and the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union. She campaigned for peace until her death in 1935, earning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931. Today, the original residence is the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, an important part of the UIC campus, and an important historical memorial in the community.
