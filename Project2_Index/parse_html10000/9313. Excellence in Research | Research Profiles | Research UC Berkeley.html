UC Berkeley is a premier research university, highly rated for the quality and breadth of its research programs and the distinction of its faculty.  Find out more about how some of our most innovative researchers address pressing global challenges. Research profiles: February 23, 2015 Diagnostic Tools: A Calculated Risk Shawn Shadden integrates diagnostic imaging with computational modeling to better diagnose stroke severity in patients.  Read More February 16, 2015 The Invisible Comes to Light Laura Waller is working on computational imaging methods for quantitative phase microscopy, which enables one to map the shape and/or density of invisible samples in a non-invasive way.  Her group is developing simple experimental architectures and efficient post-processing algorithms for phase recovery, applied in a variety of scientific and industrial settings. Read More February 9, 2015 Cancer’s Disposal System: Target for a Cure? Andreas Martin has developed novel systems and strategies to screen for compounds that selectively inhibit protein turnover in the cell and may lead to new drugs against cancer.   Read More February 2, 2015 Greener Blue Jeans John Dueber is working to employ metabolite protecting groups for a sustainable indigo dyeing process.  The new technology has the potential to transform the Jeans (and related textile) dyeing industry into a "green business" using dye processes that would comply with modern regulations ensuring environmental safeguards. Read More January 27, 2015 Welcome to the World of Wearable Electronics Ana Claudia Arias is working on a new, customized hardware that allows Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with screen-printed receiver coils arrays.  She is working with partners at UCSF and Stanford Children's Hospital to test the devices in a clinical setting. Read More January 20, 2015 Researcher Seeks to Starve Cancer of Nutrients Roberto Zoncu investigates cellular energy flux.  In researching how cells sense their own nutrients, Zoncu has found that a particular enzyme plays a vital role in making sure that a cell has the proper balance of nutrients and energy. Read More January 13, 2015 Tracking Cancer’s Advance in 3D Sanjay Kumar adapts bioengineering strategies for studies in 3D cell environments to reveal how and why cancer cells invade the way they do. Read More January 6, 2015 Fishing For A Cure Scott Baraban is collaborating with Berkeley researchers to find cures for childhood epilepsies.  Read More April 14, 2014 Can New Understanding Avert Tragedy? Solomon Hsiang's research provides a “ground–level” view of climate’s current and likely future role in such social stresses as child mortality, crime and social upheaval. Read More April 8, 2014 On Memory’s Trail Ehud Isacoff and his colleagues explore the brain at several levels critical to ultimately understand how memories form and what can threaten their demise. He is the Director of Berkeley’s Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute. Read More March 18, 2014 Crispr Goes Global Jennifer Doudna and her colleagues showed that CRISPR/Cas9, can be used with great precision to selectively disable or add several genes at once in human cells, offering a potent new tool to understand and treat complex genetic diseases. Read More March 11, 2014 Making Sense of Big Data Ben Recht was recently honored by the White House with a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, recognizing some of the most promising young researchers. Read More March 4, 2014 Using Carbon to Control the Light Feng Wang is studying how electrical fields modulate the optical properties of a number of materials. The flip of a light switch – a nano-scale light switch – may some day dramatically boost the speed of data transmission, from streaming movies to accelerating the most data-intense computation.  Read More February 25, 2014 How to Starve Out the Enemy Mary Wildermuth is developing plant breeding strategies that can weaken the effects of powdery mildew. If not controlled, powdery mildew is a fast spreading fungus that can cause billions of dollars of crop damage in California. Read More February 18, 2014 Seizing Control of Brain Seizures Daniela Kaufer made a startling discovery about the effect of psychological stress on the brain a few years after serving in the Israeli army during the first Gulf War.  Read More February 12, 2014 “Ballistic transport ” – it sounds like a blast into the future Felix Fischer and fellow researchers are fabricating strips of carbon only one-atom thick and less than 15 atoms wide, the aim is to create molecular-scale “wires” capable of carrying information thousands of times faster than is possible today. Read More February 6, 2014 Pinning down malevolent cancer cells Lydia Sohn is developing a new technique based on microtechnology to distinguish between different types of circulating tumor cells also known as CTC’s . She hopes this more sensitive approach will help clinicians learn which CTC’s are most prone to lead to metastasis. Read More May 6, 2013 Scrutinizing Space Storms for a Calmer Life on Earth Thomas Immel and his team at the Space Sciences Lab will design, build and operate two instruments and oversee development of two others to be loaded on a solar-powered satellite for a two-year science mission tentatively set to launch in 2017. Read More April 22, 2013 Packing Power Tanja Cuk is testing how to optimize new devices for both power delivery and energy storage. Her focus is an alternative to conventional batteries, called a “supercapacitor,” which could deliver more power than current batteries. Read More April 15, 2013 Creating a New Trail to Solve an Old Problem Ants normally distinguish friend from foe by detecting colony-specific molecules called pheromones that coat their bodies. Neil Tsutsui has identified the recognition pheromones and other chemical signals, and has shown in experiments that the ants’ behavior can be tweaked by exposing them to identical, environmentally harmless synthetic pheromones. Read More April 11, 2013 Wresting New Tricks From a Python: Fernando Perez Wins 2012 Award for the Advancement of Free Software In 2001 when Fernando Pérez was still a graduate student in particle physics, he kept bumping into walls with a popular programming language he was using called Python, as he tried to analyze an elusive theoretical phenomenon known as the quantum vacuum. Read More April 8, 2013 The Cell’s “Everywhere” Molecule Michael Rape studies ubiqutins that form chains, “like pearls on a string,” he says. In 2008, his lab discovered a new member of this chain configuration and determined how an enzyme called Ube2S is able to assemble it inside cells. Without the Ube2S enzyme and the ubiquitin chain, he found, cells cannot divide. But with too much Ube2S – and too many ubiquitin chains – cell division runs out of control. Read More April 1, 2013 Beyond Genomics - Mining the Proteome Lab tests that detect prostate cancer can’t reveal if the cancer poses a real risk. It looks for elevated levels of a protein called PSA, but about 80 percent of cancers that generate high PSA levels grow so slowly and may never need treatment. New research by Amy Herr points the way to a much more refined assessment of proteins and the promise of better diagnosis and treatment of a range of diseases.  Read More March 25, 2013 Mind Over Matter It still sounds futuristic, but the time is approaching when people paralyzed by stroke or spinal cord injury will be able to regain the experience of movement. Neuroengineer Jose Carmena and bioengineer Michel Maharbiz have joined forces in a project supported by the Bakar Fellows Program to move this technology from the laboratory to the real world.
