Sacramento State (15-14, 13-5 Big Sky) clinched the No. 2 seed for the Big Sky Tournament after completing its best Big Sky regular season in program history. The Hornets will face No. 7 seed Montana State in the first round of the Big Sky Tournament next week in Missoula. The Hornets and Bobcats will play the first game of the tournament at 10 a.m. Pacific time on Wednesday. The women's tournament will now run Wednesday, Friday, Saturday as Montana will host the men's tournament as well, which will open Thursday.  On Saturday Northern Arizona (13-16, 9-9 Big Sky) jumped to a 23-12 lead 10 minutes into the contest before the Hornets outscored the Lumberjacks 93-58 over the last 30 minutes. On senior day all three Hornet seniors - Takara Burse, Andrea Chenier, and Fantasia Hilliard - scored in double figures to lead the team to its 10th home win of the season. "I thought I was going to be really emotional but it turned out really well," said Hilliard, the all-time program leader in career assists and steals. "I was happy overall with my performance and my team's performance all year. We just have to build on this win and go win the tournament." Hilliard totaled 19 points, eight assists, and three steals while Chenier had 11 points and six boards and Burse had 10 points, four rebounds, and five steals. Sophomore Gretchen Harrigan led the team with 20 points on 9-of-14 shooting while freshman Maranne Johnson (15 points), sophomore Hallie Gennett (15), and sophomore Brianna Burgos (10) also posted double-digit totals. Johnson also had six rebounds and seven steals as the Hornets totaled 26 steals and forced 34 Northern Arizona turnovers. Sacramento State was 15-of-40 from 3-point range with Hilliard, Chenier, and Gennett each knocking down three long balls. Northern Arizona shot 63.2% for the game but still lost by 24 points as Sacramento State attempted 29 more shots and outscored the Lumberjacks, who attempted only two shots from beyond the arc, 45-0 from 3-point range. The three straight 100-point outputs from the Hornets is a program record. Also on Saturday the team surpassed last year's record point total of 2,494 and is now the highest scoring team in program history. Sacramento State shot just 33.3% in the first half and the Hornets started the game 4-of-23 from the field. Despite the shooting struggles the Hornets forced 20 turnovers in the first half and ended the opening period on a 36-20 run over the last 10 minutes to take a 48-43 halftime lead. Northern Arizona was within eight points at a 71-63 margin with 12 minutes left to play before a 15-4 Hornet run over the next three minutes, during which NAU committed four turnovers, pushed the Hornets to a 19-point advantage and put the game out of reach. The Hornets committed just 14 turnovers in the game and outscored the Lumberjacks 38-12 in points off turnovers. NAU had a 43-33 rebounding edge but Sacramento State had 21 offensive boards and outscored the visitors 14-4 in fast break points. Senior Raven Anderson and junior Mariah Willadsen combined for 45 of Northern Arizona's 81 points and were the only Lumberjacks in double figures. The Hornets avenged a 64-60 loss earlier this year in Flagstaff when the teams opened the Big Sky season on New Years Day. Sacramento State will be playing the first game of the Big Sky Tournament for the second consecutive year after the squad was the No. 7 seed last year and was eliminated by second-seeded Southern Utah. The Hornets last faced Montana State in the Big Sky Tournament in 2010 and are 0-2 all-time against the Bobcats in neutral site games. Montana State tied for fifth in the final league standings with Northern Arizona and North Dakota with a 9-9 Big Sky mark but lost the tiebreakers to take the No. 7 seed for the conference tournament. In their one meeting during the regular season the Bobcats handed the Hornets their largest Big Sky loss of the year in a 91-64 victory in Bozeman Jan. 29. Montana State beat regular season champion Montana on Saturday and has won eight of its last 11 games. 2015 Big Sky Women's Basketball Tournament at Missoula, Mont.
