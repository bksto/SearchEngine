One such experience was a conference trip visiting Mr. Warren Buffet, with the University of Arizona Business School. He gave us a tour of two of his businesses: Nebraska Furniture Mart and Borsheims, and took us for lunch. I was struck by his humble attitude, kind manner, and encouraging personality towards students. I admire Mr. Buffet’s accomplishments and hope to have a career that can relate to his adventurous as well as steady spirit. Another noteworthy experience was the International Summit with Golden Key International Honor Society in Atlanta, Georgia. At this global event, I was able to interact with a diverse group of people as the Ambassador for my chapter. Being around such motivated and intelligent individuals was contagious and helped me develop a plan to improve my home chapter. I hope to work with a diverse group of people in my future career and to learn from each unique individual. There are so many experiences that have shaped my career path that helped me get to where I am today. I look forward to sharing more stories with you.
