The program follows an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon political science, international relations and international political economy to study the global rise of the Gulf states and the evolution of domestic and regional policy agendas. Areas of focus range from macro-level political, economic and security analysis of region-wide trends to detailed country-specific research as the GCC states reformulate political economies hitherto based on the redistribution of hydrocarbon revenues. Working with internationally recognized partners in the region, the program conducts research on urgent public policy issues in the Gulf. There are two main research dimensions to the program. The first concentrates on developing policy recommendations for GCC states as they move from a political economy based on comparative advantage in energy to one based on competitive advantage in human capital. The second examines the GCC states’ rebalancing within a global order itself in flux and assesses the nature of their engagement in reshaping regional and international institutions and structures of governance. Both are underpinned by analysis of how the “Arab Spring” has injected new sources of vulnerability just as the Gulf states have emerged as regional powers with international reach, as well as implications for U.S. policy toward this vital region.
