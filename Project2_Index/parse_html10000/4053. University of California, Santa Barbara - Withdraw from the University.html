If the petition and deadline requirements are met and the approval of your college dean is secured, you will be withdrawn officially. If your petition is filed prior to the first day of instruction, your registration is cancelled and your fees are unassessed. If your petition is filed during the early weeks of the quarter, you may be entitled to a partial refund of the quarterly fees you have paid, or promised to pay, as listed by the fee refund schedule. The deadline for undergraduate students in the College of Engineering and the College of Letters and Science to submit a completed petition is the last day of instruction for the quarter. Undergraduate students in the College of Creative Studies have until the last day of the quarter to submit a completed petition. The date a completed petition is received by the Office of the Registrar is the official withdrawal date. Important Information 1) Federal and state regulations require that students who have received financial aid return a portion of that aid if they withdraw before completing 60% of the quarter. If your registration is cancelled, 100% of your aid will be cancelled. Please advise the Financial Aid Office if you will return in a subsequent quarter. 2) Newly admitted undergraduate students who withdraw from all registered classes prior to the 15th day of instruction during the quarter of admission will not be eligible for readmission and must reapply to the University through the regular undergraduate admission process adhering to Admissions processing deadlines. For further information contact the Office of Admissions. 3) When undergraduate students are enrolled in courses and the completed petition is submitted after the final drop deadline, the Office of the Registrar will enter a grade of W for each course in which the student was enrolled. 4) If you have completed the enrollment process and then discontinue work for the quarter without filing a petition for withdrawal, failing grades will be recorded in all the courses in which you have enrolled, you will be ineligible for any refund of fees, and your future registration privileges may be blocked. 5) The Office of Student Life can provide assistance with a current quarter withdrawal petition when the student is incapacitated or unable to complete the process personally due to serious illness or injury, or another serious emergency. The emergency situation must reasonably prevent the student from completing the form and obtaining the required signatures in person, by fax, or by mail. For assistance, call (805) 893-4521 or E-mail (danna.sandor@sa.ucsb.edu) OSL. Note: Final approval of the withdrawal request is granted by the student’s college. 6) After withdrawal and before future registration, you must apply for and receive permission to be readmitted/reinstated. 7) You are advised to consult with faculty, departmental or college advisers, and/or Counseling and Career Services before withdrawing so as to consider the full implications of this action. Graduate students Continuous registration is required of graduate students. Leaves of Absence may be granted under extraordinary circumstances. Consult the Graduate Division for information on eligibility.
