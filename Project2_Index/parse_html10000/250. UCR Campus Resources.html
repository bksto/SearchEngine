What Makes UCR So Great? It's not just the world-class faculty and facilities that make UC Riverside the place to be — it's also the thriving arts community, the one-of-a-kind special collections and lecture series that attract experts from around the world. It's the concerts, film festivals, dazzling dance performances and thought-provoking theater. It's the beauty of our Botanic Gardens and famed 22-acre Citrus Variety Collection. It's the Campus Store and KUCR, our own non-commercial radio station playing cutting-edge music. And, of course, it's the UCR Libraries, with over two million volumes and home to the world's largest cataloged collection of science fiction and fantasy. And we're just getting started!
