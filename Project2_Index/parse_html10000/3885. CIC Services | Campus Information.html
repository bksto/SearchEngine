Campus Information was developed largely in response to the lack of centralized information at the University of Michigan. People were frustrated with going to the wrong place, not getting the information needed, and discovering too late that the university had a service or facility that could have helped them. These problems were aggravated by the university’s large size and decentralized nature. Therefore, in 1978, the first proposal was made to implement a system to solve that problem. To deal with this issue we operate sites both on central and north campus.
