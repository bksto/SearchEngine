It is our job to help you identify funding opportunities, prepare your proposals, and administer your grants when you get them. It is also our responsibility to develop cross-disciplinary scholarship opportunities that very often reach into the community or to other institutions. RTT is divided into the following functional areas: Research Development, with responsibility for helping you find funding opportunities, prepare your proposals, and submit them on your behalf; Research Compliance, with responsibility for negotiation of contracts, reporting, and adherence to federal, state, local and University laws/regulations for external funding; Intellectual Property & Technology Transfer, with responsibility for commercialization of the faculty's research ideas; Centers and Institutes, with responsibility for development and management of cross-disciplinary centers of excellence and/or institutes. RTT works closely with Sponsored Programs Accounting (SPA), a division of Finance and Administration. SPA provides post-award support to all faculty and staff that work with externally funded programs. Centers & Institutes Centers of Excellence assemble a critical mass of interdisciplinary faculty, staff and students to focus on significant research questions.  Learn more about the Centers & Institutes >> Measure MEASURE: The research publication of ASU Browse all magazines>> Catalyst Innovation Home Research & Technology Transfer Research Development Research Compliance Intellectual Property & Technology Transfer Sponsored Programs Accounting Forms Staff Measure Magazine Software Tools CAYUSE IRBnet SPIN Plus CITI Contact Research & Technology Transfer research@astate.edu Phone: 870-972-2694 Fax: 870-972-2336 Postal Address: P.O.
