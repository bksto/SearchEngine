Thorough a shared vision and philanthropic partnership foundations are joining UC Davis to support: Cutting-edge research Education Programs Patient Care Emerging opportunities across the university These partnerships play a critical role in facilitating discoveries that improve the world and assisting exceptional students in realizing their full potential. Why Foundation Partnerships The field of higher education is in a great deal of flux today. There are a number of reasons for this volatility, but top on the list is significant decreases in funding from federal and state sources. Private funding tops more $200 billion annually, of which 20 percent or $41 billion comes from private foundations. These dollars are distributed based on a carefully planned and executed strategy developed by the foundations' boards in coordination with their field officers.   The Office of Foundation Relations Our Mission The Office of Foundation and Corporate Giving was created with a three-pronged mission of: 1) providing high value-add services to the University Community, 2) fundraising for priority initiatives as designated by the Administration and 3) increasing foundation and corporate philanthropic support for UC Davis’ teaching, research and service mission.
