It is a 27 ft Zodiac that has been planned and outfitted by Burkard Baschek, UCLA. It is ideally suited for coastal research and measurements of small-scale quickly-evolving phenomena, such as submesoscale features, tidal fronts, or river plume fronts. UCLA is member of the Southern California Marine Institute (SCMI), San Pedro, CA, and the Research Zodiac is operated by this consortium.
