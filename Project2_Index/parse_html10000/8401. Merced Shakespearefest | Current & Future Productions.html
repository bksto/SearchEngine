See Free Shakespeare in Applegate Park! Coming up next: We'll be back in Applegate Park in September 2015 with Henry V! "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers..."   More info coming soon...   We hope you enjoyed the magical romance, The Winter’s Tale, as much as we loved performing for you. This production, set in both the 1950s and 60s, was filled with live music, dancing and the acting talents of a cast of 25, community members, UC faculty and students, and eleven children.   Shakespeare’s masterful late play brings to life unforgettable characters, dramatic plot turns, poetic language, and the magic of forgiveness. This was truly community theater, bringing together folks of all ages and experience levels to create a memorable, touching piece, staged by Director Katherine Brokaw.
