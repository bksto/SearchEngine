The four years you spend at UMass Amherst is your time for intellectual and personal development. By participating in one of the hundreds of groups within SAI, you will increase your organizational and teambuilding skills while enjoying opportunities for friendship, leadership, and community service. You will expand your views of humanity and the world we all share. Involvement is hands-on - whether it's running a meeting or running an event - the SAI is fueled by student energy. Make a point of stopping by SAI and take some time to meet with our staff. We look forward to working with you! Erin Donnally Drake Director of Student Activities and Involvement Student Union Room 416   Campus Pulse is your gateway to hundreds of campus activities, campus offices, and more than 200 student organizations.
