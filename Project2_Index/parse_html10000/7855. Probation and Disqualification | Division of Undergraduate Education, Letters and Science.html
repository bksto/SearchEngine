You can learn more about the university’s academic probation and disqualification policies by consulting the General Catalog. Frequently Asked Questions What is Probation? Students are placed on academic probation when their most recent quarter and cumulative Grade Point Average dip below 2.0. This status is called Probation 1 (P-1). Students placed on P-1 probation cannot choose Pass/No Pass optional grading and cannot enroll in more than 17 units in the next term. What happens if after being placed on P-1 Probation my next term GPA is above a 2.0 but my cumulative GPA is still below 2.0? Students on Probation P-1, who earn a term GPA above a 2.0 but whose cumulative GPA remains below 2.0 will continue on probation for one more regular term under Probation 2 (P-2). Students placed on P-2 probation cannot choose Pass/No Pass optional grading and cannot enroll in more than 17 units in the next term. How do I get off Probation? Students on probation (P-1 or P-2) will return to regular status if their next regular term (fall, winter, or spring) GPA is above a 2.0 and their cumulative GPA rises above a 2.0. What happens if I have a really bad quarter but my cumulative GPA is still at least 2.0? Students who have a regular term GPA below 1.5 are placed on Subject to Disqualification Status SA, regardless of their cumulative GPA. Students falling below 1.5 for the first time, after fall or winter term, are likely to be reinstated by the Dean for the next term. However, students need to check their UMail and GOLD accounts for important messaging from the Dean regarding advising and support resources, enrollment instructions, and other possible stipulations placed on their continued enrollment. Please Note: A student whose first term GPA at UCSB falls below 1.0 will be reinstated for the next term if he or she meets with an Academic Advisor prior to the end of the first week of instruction of the next (winter) term. Failure to meet with an advisor during the first week of instruction will result in winter term classes being lapsed and the student’s dismissal. What happens when I am on P-1 or P-2 Probation and my next term GPA is below 2.0? Students who do not achieve a 2.0 term GPA while on probation, P-1 or P-2, will be placed on Subject to Disqualification Status SB. Students Subject to Disqualification SB are required to appeal to the Dean of Undergraduate Education if they wish to continue their studies in the next academic term. Students with a SB status will receive an email which will address their options and will include a link to the Dean’s Appeal Questionnaire and the deadline by when the questionnaire must be submitted for the student to be considered for continued enrollment. Submission of an appeal does not guarantee reinstatement for the next term. What happens if my Cumulative GPA is still below 2.0 after being on P-2 Probation? Students who do not raise their cumulative GPA above 2.0 after two terms of being on probation (P-2) will be placed into a Subject to Disqualification Status SC. Students Subject to Disqualification SC are required to appeal to the Dean of Undergraduate Education if they wish to continue their studies in the next academic term. Students with a SC status will receive an email which will address their options and will include a link to the Dean’s Appeal Questionnaire and the deadline by when the questionnaire must be submitted for the student to be considered for continued enrollment. Submission of an appeal does not guarantee reinstatement for the next term.   What happens if I have been SA before and find myself in an S category again? Students who are SA for a second time are required to appeal to the Dean of Undergraduate Education if they wish to continue their studies in the next academic term. Students with a repeat SA status will receive an email which will address their options and will include a link to the Dean’s Appeal Questionnaire and the deadline by when the questionnaire must be submitted for the student to be considered for continued enrollment. Submission of an appeal does not guarantee reinstatement for the next term. What happens if my appeal is granted? If the Dean grants your appeal, you will be Reinstated on Probation for the next term and may not choose Pass/No Pass optional grading and will not be able to enroll in more than 17 units. Most likely, you will be required to meet with an academic advisor early in term. If my appeal is deined, what else can I do? Students whose appeals are denied are urged to make an appointment with an academic advisor in the College of Letters and Science. An advisor will discuss your situation with you, answer questions about what steps to take next, and advise you on how to improve your record and return to your studies. It is important that any dismissed student seek advice from a College of Letters and Science Advisor before enrolling at another institution. A College Advisor will make sure you understand the Academic Regulations that will impact your planned return to regular status at UCSB. What if I think I may be subject to disqualification but have not received a message from the Dean in GOLD, nor a U-Mail notification? Processing grades can take up to 5-10 working days from the end of the previous term. If you are not certain of your status within 7 working days after the completion of the term, contact the college of Letters and Science to enquire about your standing. You can contact the college via email, phone, or by coming into our office, 1117 Cheadle Hall (view map). The College of Letters and Science is open, Monday, Thursday, and Friday, 9 AM-12 PM, and 1-4 PM, and Tuesday and Wednesday, 9:30 AM-12 PM, 1-4 PM.
