It’s a good, lively talk–covering all the ground I could on the Raiders’ stadium efforts in Carson and Oakland, the approach to the free-agent period coming within days, and some other things. Advertisement Here’s the link to the full 25-minute conversation, including a second recommendation (after Jerry West’s two weeks ago) for Dan Tana’s in Hollywood. (We’re taping another episode with another major figure later today and we’ll post that in the afternoon.) Some highlights from the Davis appearance: -Davis explains that he and Chargers owner Dean Spanos started talking about getting together on the Carson project six weeks ago, says he’s familiar with the site from past suggestions and says it’s a 50-50 proposal. “I’ve never been against sharing one but we had to start at the same time and be able to market at the same time, and that’s what we have the opportunity to do in this situation,” Davis said. -Davis said they’re working on the stadium’s design phase and: “I would say that the Carson site does have the pre-requisites that I’m most interested in,” Davis said, pointing to the freeway access and parking available. -Davis talks about the irony of working on this with the Chargers, the Raiders’ AFC West rival. “Once Dean and I started talking about the stadium, we realized we have very similar business principles–so it’s really working pretty good,” Davis said. There’s more… -Why he prefers sharing a stadium in Carson rather than sharing Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara with the 49ers. -What Davis would do if Spanos cuts his own deal with San Diego and pulls out of the Carson project. -Whether other cities remain an option–St. Louis or San Antonio–for the Raiders. -What he thinks about baseball commissioner Rob Manfred implicitly connecting the Raiders’ situation to the A’s possible project on the Coliseum site. “I don’t know if people are aware of it or not, but Lew and I have sat down a couple times in the most recent past and have tried to figure out a way to possibly work together,” Davis said. “There’s been nothing that has come of that but at least we’re talking about it–we’ve talked about it. And it’s just a tough thing to do for both teams on that site.” -A summary on his feelings about Oakland: Advertisement “We have to see what the sense of urgency is with Oakland and if they want to get anything done,” Davis said. -Also Davis’ push for the NFL to take a stronger stance against domestic violence. * Oh, that’s right, there’s NFL free agency, set to start next week, with the Raiders sitting on upwards of $70M in cap space and apparently willing to use it. “Tomorrow I’m heading down to the bank and picking up that Brink’s truck and getting it ready for free agency period,” Davis joked. Davis said this has been a three-year process to get in position to sign players to long-term contracts. “It’s really exciting and there are some players out there,” Davis said. “We’re going to see what we can do.” Note: Davis also has a great favorite TV show. Listen to the end for that one.

RAMS will be in LA in 16! Raiders will get the stadium done, one way or another. Hopefully grand master dumbass will love wearing blue and gold, because silver and black will stay in oakland! ! eyepatch9 And it really helped you in 1995! The Raiders do not need a toxic landfill or gangsters to call home. Sachs is behind the chargers, but they have nothing to do with the raiders. Face it, we just signed a year lease with oakland coliseum and it just gives us more time to finalize things and tie up loose ends for the new stadium! Get your Vince Farragamo jersey ready to wear because the rams will be gangland’s new team! eyepatch9 He said that after every superbowl ! Do your homework! Oh wait, being in County jail probably means homework is the last thing on your mind! Being in county,you probably know more about k-y jelly than raider history! http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ No need for disrespect. Second, notice how there haven’t been any SB Wins in Oakland for Davis to say that line about SINCE the one in LA. {{-_-}} http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ I saw your city council meeting. It ain’t US reaching for a glimmer of hope. Lol The Rams are staying in STL. The league won’t let the Rams leave a place that is finally building a stadium. LA won’t have 3 teams. But whichever team(s) we DO get WILL include the Raiders. You act like there aren’t gangs and fights in Oakland. Quit acting delusional. The fact that you’re getting disrespectful shows that you know you’re about to lose the Raiders again for the last time. {{-_-}} StLenny You are an idiot! Obviously have no clue what you are talking about! The Rams are not leaving St. Louis! Perhaps you should do a better job at researching the topic, and less time throwing out childish insults! http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ There are gangs in Oakland that will kill you too. What is your point? We already know how our fans are. In the Bay AND in LA. Besides, gangs aren’t gonna stop a thing. Gangsters buy tickets too. {{-_-}} http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ And you don’t have a year. You only have a week or 2 left. The year will be your lame duck season while the Raiders prepare the moving vans for LA. {{-_-}} StLenny The new StL Riverfront stadium is looking sweet! https://www.facebook.com/pages/Riverfront-Stadium-Home-of-the-St-Louis-RAMS/923671501000855?fref=nf http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ Again, STL is building a new stadium so the Rams will be staying THERE. Oakland has had over 20 years to build a stadium. We have heard everything you’re saying before. Just give it up. {{-_-}} http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ I tried to tell him. {{-_-}} StLenny The St. Louis Rams are NOT going anywhere…. Get a clue! http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ Al Davis’ own words: “If LA can get a stadium, they can knock at the door.” Goldman Sachs WILL back the Raiders financially if the Chargers stay in San Diego. Even if they don’t, Mark will STILL go it alone. You signed a lease for your lame duck season. Hope you win the Super Bowl because it’ll be the LAST one for Oakland. {{-_-}} StLenny It’s desperation setting in…. I see the Chargers/Raiders Carson Project coming together! I believe that is what the League is pushing as well! A California solution to LA. http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ Exactly. LA is Raidertown. {{-_-}} StLenny Again with the insults and trash talk, it only makes you seem uninformed and stupid! The Carson project will become a reality and the St. Louis Rams are staying in St. Louis. FACT http://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562 GRAND MASTER SEN$Ei {{-_-}}™ The Chargers can stay in SD. We can take on Carson alone. {{-_-}} StLenny Denial? StLenny Good luck with that! StLenny The NFL wants a California solution to the LA problem….Chargers/Raiders/Carson make the most sense! StLenny That’s no logic, that’s desperation or delusion….or maybe both! StLenny Serious denial going on here! eyepatch9 Not raidertown, gangtown! ← Older Comments Search for: Sports Headlines Chris Johnson, NFL running back, shot in shoulder Draymond Green helps Golden State Warriors to victory Frank Gore appears headed for Philadelphia Eagles Market reports: Frank Gore to Eagles?
