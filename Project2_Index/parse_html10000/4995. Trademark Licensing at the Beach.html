Creating and maintaining positive relationships with manufacturers, retailers and consumers is an integral part of promoting the university, and helps to ensure that all products bearing the marks of CSULB/Long Beach State are of the highest quality. What is a Trademark? All names and visual representations of California State University, Long Beach/Long Beach State are considered its trademarks. This includes all word marks, service marks, names, name variants, nicknames, logotypes, logos, insignia, shields, seals, designs, devises or symbols that refer to the university. Also included are any words, phrases or images that imply association with CSULB or Long Beach State. Who needs a license? Manufacturers, producers and any other entities that plan to use the trademarks of the university must complete the licensing process and carry an agreement prior to producing, distributing, and selling emblematic merchandise. This includes the use of logos and word marks on all products intended for retail, promotional use, fund raising, university and student organization use, including giveaways. How can a manufacturer obtain a license? Cal State Long Beach has contracted with the Licensing Resource Group, Inc. (LRG) to manage the licensing process. You should contact LRG directly or visit www.lrgusa.com to obtain an application for license. The application will need to be completed and returned along with the required elements in order to be considered for a license with Cal State Long Beach. How can a CSULB Department, Organization, Club or Group obtain a license? If a department, organization, club, or group plans to have merchandise produced that bears any reference to the university, the manufacturer must be licensed prior to production. If the product produced is for resale (including fund raisers and other for-sale situations), manufacturers are required to collect royalties. You need to upgrade your Flash Player.
