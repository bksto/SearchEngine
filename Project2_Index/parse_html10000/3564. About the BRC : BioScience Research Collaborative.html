More than just a building, it is an interdisciplinary, interinstitutional catalyst for new and better ways to collaborate, explore, learn and lead. As Scientific Director of the BRC and Vice Provost for Translational Bioscience, a primary focus for Dr. M. Cindy Farach-Carson is to build interdisciplinary research collaborations in the broad spectrum of biomedical and health research and education, and to assist faculty with establishing multidisciplinary translational research programs.  Additional responsibilities include assisting with space planning, working closely with the Director of Operations and the Vice Provost for Research, to develop building programs that facilitate the scientific enterprise and bring vibrancy to the building’s activities.  For more information regarding Dr. Farach-Carson, click here.
