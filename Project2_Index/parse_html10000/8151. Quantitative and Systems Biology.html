Applying to QSB QSB Degrees About UC Merced Current Students Events QSB Annual Retreats QSB Seminar Series Accelerating biological discovery through innovation Whether your passion is to reduce human suffering from disease, mitigate climate-change effects on ecosystems, or advance how we understand, explain and predict living systems, your career will benefit from the unique competitive advantages of a QSB degree. Our Faculty QSB faculty engage in quantitative and interdisciplinary biology research and education across the biological sciences. Read More Our Partnerships We have partnerships with the Joint Genome Institute, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and many other institutions. Read More Our Facilities QSB researchers access top-notch facilities including the Stem Cell Instrumentation Foundry (SCIF), a shared high-performance computing (HPC) cluster for Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and Discovery (MERCED), and a shared Illumina MiSeq. Read More Quantitative and Systems Biology Advances in techniques and theory that bridge molecular and ecosystems scales have greatly enabled the potential for integration across the life sciences. Biologists' ability to gather and process large amounts of quantitative data in field and laboratory settings is advancing hand-in-hand with theory and modeling that better explain the diversity of life on Earth.
