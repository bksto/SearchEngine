Refer to the links below for the official dates and times for final exams. Instructors are not authorized to change the published time of final examinations. You are responsible for arranging your program so that your final exams will not conflict or fall in rapid succession. Normally, examinations will be written, and a maximum time period for their completion will be announced in advance. You will not be permitted to exceed this maximum. The maximum time for a final in a non-laboratory course is three hours. Individual exceptions from finals are not permitted. Examinations are grouped by the beginning hour and the first day that the class meets in a regular week. For example: Finals for M-W-F courses beginning anytime between 9:00-9:50 are grouped with the 9:00 courses. Finals for T-R courses beginning at non-standard times (e.g., T-R at 12:00), are grouped with the 12:30 courses. (Standard start times for T-R courses are: 8:00, 9:30, 11:00, 12:30, 2:00, 3:30, 5:00, 6:30, and 8:00) Finals for courses that meet M-T-W-R or M-T-W-R-F from 3:00-3:50 are grouped with the M-W-F 3:00-3:50 courses. Finals for courses that meet W from 2:00-4:50 are grouped with the M-W-F 2:00-2:50 courses. Finals for courses that meet T-W-R from 11:45-12:30 are grouped with the T-R 11:00-12:15 courses. Finals for courses that meet M-W from 3:30-4:45 are grouped with the M-W-F 3:00-3:50 courses.
