A critical measure of a university’s performance is the effectiveness with which it employs its resources to ensure students meet their educational goals in a timely manner. This institutional and social priority must be accompanied by a commitment to the success of all students, including those from historically underrepresented groups. Improving persistence of our students, especially in their entering year, is an important first step in this process. High-Impact Practices (HIP), those pedagogical and programmatic approaches that promote student engagement, retention and graduation, are integral to these efforts. Objectives: Increase the overall 6-year graduation rate, such that the Fall 2012 cohort of first-time full-time freshman is at least 10 percentage points higher than that of the Fall 2006 cohort. Increase the 4-year transfer graduation rate, such that the Fall 2014 cohort is at least 10 percentage points higher than that of the Fall 2008 cohort. Reduce by at least half the current 12% achievement gap between underrepresented and non-underrepresented students. Increase participation in High-Impact Practices (HIPs) and ensure that 75% of CSUF students participate in at least two HIPs by graduation. Strategies: Identify and expand programs that have a documented impact on increasing student achievement in bottleneck, gateway and low success rate academic courses. Identify and increase participation in new and ongoing efforts that support underrepresented student persistence and achievement. Identify, track and integrate curricular and co-curricular High-Impact Practices and ensure participation in one HIP in the first year and one subsequent HIP in student's major field. Establish accountability metrics at the division, college, department, and program levels to ensure progress on retention and graduation rate strategies.     This site is maintained by Strategic Communications.  Last Published 10/20/14 To report problems or comments, please contact strategiccomm@fullerton.edu.
