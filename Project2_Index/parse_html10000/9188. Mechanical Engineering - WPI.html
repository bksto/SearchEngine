These dedicated professionals continue to push the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines— from aircraft carriers to household appliances. WPI’s Mechanical Engineering department provides students with a solid foundation in the engineering sciences and a strong grounding in practical, problem-solving skills. This combined approach, along with hands-on project experiences, makes WPI graduates ready and able to hit the ground running and add value from the very start of their careers. Concentration areas within the program include: Aeronautics Astronautics Biomechanical Engineering mechanics Manufacturing Materials science and engineering Mechanical design   Robotics  Thermal-fluid engineering Engineering Sturdier Gears for Windmills Wind turbines are expected to produce electricity. But the quality of their design and manufacture is a key factor in their efficiency and dependability.
