UCSD's estimated budgets include all education costs: registration fees, non-California resident tuition, room and board, books and supplies, transportation, personal expenses, and a health care insurance fee (or health care allowance). Students have choices about where they will live while attending UCSD. Each of these living arrangements has a different estimated cost. Your estimated budget helps you and the Financial Aid Office determine approximately how much money you need to attend UCSD, and how much financial aid you need to meet that goal. Your actual costs may differ. And of course, the amount anyone spends depends greatly on his or her own personal situation and individual choices.

Important: All estimated budgets are subject to change. Other resources you may find helpful: Financial Aid Estimator: This calculator tool provides estimates of financial aid award for prospective students. Actual financial aid is determined by completing a FAFSA. Planning ahead: The UC San Diego Campus Profile (PDF) includes information about fees and financial aid, and a financial aid estimator. Financial need: Find out how UCSD's Financial Aid Office calculates the financial aid you may receive based on your need. Read more in How UCSD Determines Financial Aid Awards. Approved part-time study: Your fees and tuition will be reduced if you're approved for part-time study. This also results in financial aid reduction. Non-California resident students: Non-California residents pay Non-California Resident Supplemental Tuition (currently estimated to be $22,878 annually) in addition to charges paid by in-state students. The university is unable to provide university grant or scholarship support for this additional tuition cost. Federal loans, which must be repaid by you or your family, may help cover some or all of this cost. Not all Non-California residents will qualify for a Federal or Private Loan, thus all Non-California resident families should be prepared to pay the additional cost, currently $22,878 annually, from family resources. For details, see: Residence for tuition purposes About loans Subsidized child care: Child care costs qualify as a budget add-on and may make you eligible for loans. Also, UCSD's Early Childhood Education Center (ECEC) may be able to offer you full-time, on-campus subsidized child care.
