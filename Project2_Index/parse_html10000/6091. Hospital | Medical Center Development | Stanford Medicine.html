The new Stanford Hospital will capture the promises of the biomedical revolution, translating the innovations of Stanford University and Silicon Valley into better health outcomes. A model of what health care can and should be in the 21st century, it will serve our community, and the world, for many decades to come. Inspired by the possibilities of the biomedical revolution and the human needs of individual patients, architect Raphael Viñoly set out to completely reimagine what a hospital could be. In the new Stanford Hospital, healing will be an upward journey that begins the moment patients arrive. It starts on the first floor with the reassurance of a seamless admissions process in a calm space filled with natural light. One floor up, the Advanced Treatment Center will offer the most precise and powerful diagnostics and treatments available. Patients will recover in individual rooms in the Care Pavilions above. Between the technology below and tranquility above lies an enormous rooftop garden where public and private spaces will merge in an oasis of trees, flowers, walking paths, and panoramic views, all carefully planned to promote healing. It’s a design that will literally take health care to the next level – and make the new Stanford Hospital a global model of how to best heal both body and spirit. The Story “Behind the Design” Experience the New Stanford Hospital Connect Level 1 Connect Healing starts the moment patients arrive. Whether they enter through the sunny central atrium or the state-of-the-art Marc and Laura Andreessen Emergency Department, every detail will enhance emotional and physical well-being. More Level 1 Connect Healing starts the moment patients arrive. Whether they enter through the sunny central atrium or the state-of-the-art Marc and Laura Andreessen Emergency Department, every detail will enhance emotional and physical well-being. More A warm introduction to leading edge coordinated care. A soaring atrium bathed in sunlight will extend a bright and uplifting welcome to all who enter the new Stanford Hospital. Every detail of this central space is designed to ensure each patient’s journey begins with the reassurance of personalized service and friendly faces. How do we ease the stress of one of life’s most stressful moments? That question shapes every aspect of the new Stanford Hospital. It also shapes our mission. Each of our compassionate researchers, clinicians, and staff is driven by a deep desire to make life easier for our patients. This hospital will allow us to deliver a new standard of seamlessly coordinated patient care that’s built around the unique physical and emotional needs of each patient. We’ll handle every detail for them – appointments, insurance, medical records, prescriptions, and more – so they can focus all their energies on healing. The journey will begin in the soothing, sunlit spaces of the central atrium or through a grove of medicinal trees standing just outside the entrance of the Marc and Laura Andreessen Emergency Department. Registration will be simple and quick. In addition to abundant assistance from staff, patients will have tablets and apps to connect them with directions, health information, care plans, and other helpful resources. Inviting spots to meet, relax, and talk will surround them, including an expansive indoor/outdoor dining commons on a vibrant promenade that will lead to the existing hospital complex and the rest of Stanford’s campus. Emergency services that are ready for anything. From heart attacks to earthquakes, the greatly expanded Marc and Laura Andreessen Emergency Department and the adjacent imaging center are engineered to handle disasters of any scale. Both will add critically needed capacity to the only level I trauma center between San Francisco and San Jose. The peninsula depends on Stanford Hospital. As the region’s designated disaster response center with the area’s only helicopter ambulance service, Stanford has provided fast, effective emergency care to the community for decades. However, Stanford Hospital’s existing facilities date as far back as the 1950s. Strict new seismic standards and cramped, outdated spaces prompted the need for a new hospital. However, thanks to the generosity and vision of our donors, the result won’t be just a safer, bigger building. It will be the one of the world’s most advanced hospitals – with the most advanced emergency services – right here in our backyard. Vastly increased capacity means this new facility will meet the Peninsula’s needs for decades to come. And that capacity can scale up fast. In the event of a disaster or pandemic, the adjacent garage is engineered to quickly convert into an enormous extension of the emergency department, complete with direct heliport access and drive-through triage. Patients will be treated in individual rooms so loved ones can stay by their sides. State-of-the-art imaging will be located next door to save precious time. And all the resources of the Advanced Treatment Center immediately above will be a quick, private elevator ride away.

Disaster Response The parking garage is engineered to serve as an extension of the emergency department in the event of an earthquake, pandemic, or other disaster. With decontamination showers, direct elevators to the helipad, and critical emergency equipment, capacity can ramp up almost instantly to accommodate vastly increased patient volumes. Ambulance. Drive-Through Triage Stanford Health Care led the nation with a “drivethough triage” exercise that demonstrated patients can be medically assessed effectively, efficiently, and safely during large-scale emergencies. Not only has that innovative concept been incorporated into the design of the new Stanford Hospital, it’s being replicated across the country. Emergency room. Emergency Department The new Marc and Laura Andreessen Emergency Department will almost triple current capacity, ensuring Stanford Hospital meets community needs for decades to come. Dedicated treatment and waiting areas will serve pediatric patients and their families. A new road, along with separate entrances for ambulances and the public, will ensure fast, convenient access. Advanced Imaging Carefully co-located with the Marc and Laura Andreessen Emergency Department, this area will feature a collection of the world’s most advanced diagnostic and interventional imaging capabilities. Atrium. Atrium A three-story atrium will fill this space with natural light and create a comfortable, welcoming arrival for patients, families, and visitors.

Treat Level 2 Treat With and entire floor dedicated to providing the most advanced medical interventions, the new Stanford Hospital will bring state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment technologies together in one place, giving patients a crucial head start toward recovery. More Level 2 Treat With and entire floor dedicated to providing the most advanced medical interventions, the new Stanford Hospital will bring state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment technologies together in one place, giving patients a crucial head start toward recovery. More Precision interventions for better outcomes. The Advanced Treatment Center will span the second floor, bringing together the most advanced diagnostics and treatments available anywhere. Multidisciplinary teams of surgeons, radiologists, and others will put breakthroughs of the biomedical revolution to work, delivering life-saving treatments. The innovative concept of hybrid interventional suites will transform acute care medicine. Built around these flexible spaces, the Advanced Treatment Center will provide options that are more effective and less invasive than anything available today. Each suite will combine equipment for image-guided surgery, interventional radiology, angiography, catheterization, and endoscopy, giving providers the ability to respond quickly and flexibly to any medical need. This co-location eliminates the risks of moving patients around for different procedures, and can reduce time to treatment by as much as 80 percent. Hybrid suites will revolutionize the treatment of strokes, heart attacks, traumatic injuries, and more. When every second and every millimeter count, the unprecedented speed and precision empowered by these suites will save lives and function that might otherwise be lost. Patients will also reap the benefits of shorter recovery times and reduced stress. Most patients will pass through the Advanced Treatment Center on their journey to recovery. Following treatment, they can recuperate in the Center’s recovery suite, its intensive care unit, or in an individual patient room in the Pavilions on the levels above. Diagnosis and treatment together in one place A - Interventional Suites B - Intensive Suites C - Family Lounge D - Lobby E - Atrium F - Visitor Lounge G - Prep & Recovery Interventional Suites Designed with the flexibility to incorporate future advances in medicine and technology, these modular suites will provide state-of-the-art surgical and interventional platforms. When the hospital opens, many will be hybrid suites, equipped with a combination of diagnostic and treatment technologies to reduce time to intervention by as much as 80 percent. Intensive Care Suites These ICUs will serve high-acuity patients in close proximity to surgical and other interventional capabilities.

More Resources and respite to help you through. A soothing sanctuary filled with light, art, music, and the healing power of nature will encompass the entire third floor. A vast indoor/outdoor space, the Garden Level will provide patients, families, visitors, and staff an abundance of helpful resources and peaceful places to rest, reflect, and heal. This is the healing heart of the new Stanford Hospital. The centerpiece of this innovative design, the Garden Level will be a verdant rooftop refuge perched sixty feet above the streets below. With its tranquil, contemplative atmosphere, this extraordinary oasis will serve as a calm interface between the busy activity of the first and second levels and the quiet privacy of the Care Pavilions above. But its careful arrangement of trees, flowers, walking paths, and sculpture gardens will do far more. The Garden Level is designed to soothe the soul – and deliver a powerful synergy of science and compassion. More than just a pretty place, the Garden Level will impart real therapeutic benefits to patients. Extensive research has demonstrated that gardens reduce stress, boost immune function, support pain management, and improve overall well-being. A galleria encircling the central atrium will host art exhibits and musical performances. A conference center and a branch of the Stanford Health Library will house educational events and resources. There will be a meditation space along with multicultural pastoral services to provide spiritual support. For staff, a dedicated indoor/ outdoor space will provide a place to rest and recharge.

More Levels 4-7 Care Patient rooms filled with light from huge windows and love from family will give patients the quiet and comfort they need to heal. More The support of family when you need it most. Patients will recover in their own rooms with views across the red-tiled roofs of Stanford, comfortable sleeper sofas so loved ones can stay the night, and the latest videoconferencing technologies to keep them closely connected with physicians, caregivers, family, and friends. A quiet place to heal. Every patient needs one, so each of the bright, spacious rooms in the Care Pavilions will be a private healing haven, designed to deliver the highest standard of care in a soothing, home-like environment. All of the patient rooms on the fourth floor are specially designed to provide intensive care. Why individual rooms? Single occupancy reduces the risk of infection and ensures patients can rest undisturbed by roommates. It also improves efficiency and minimizes the need to move patients after they’ve settled in. Best of all, it allows for the comforting and continuous presence of loved ones, who will be able to stay the night. The care pavilions were designed and tested in an intensive, multi-year process by teams of providers in full-scale mock-ups. From the layout of the rooms and bathrooms, to each finish and fixture, every detail was chosen to improve safety, efficiency, and comfort. Even the flat screen televisions will do more than just entertain. Personalized meals, test results, medical orders, and care plans will all be available through them, along with Internet and videoconferencing. To ensure patients are clear on the roles of all their providers, the system will read the electronic badges of employees and display their photos, names and titles as they enter the room. Compassionate care in comfortable surroundings A - Patient Rooms B - Atrium C - Family Lounges D - ICU Rooms Patient Rooms Each of these large, bright rooms are meticulously designed to increase safety and provide patients with the highest level of care and comfort. Diagnostics and treatments will be delivered bedside whenever possible. Entertainment, Internet, videoconferencing, personalized meals, and more will be accessible from large, flat screen TVs, and loved ones will be able to stay with patients overnight on comfortable pull-out beds. Atrium A three-story atrium will fill this space with natural light and create a comfortable, welcoming arrival for patients, families, and visitors. Family Lounges Levels 4-7 will have convenient, comfortable rooms where family members can take a break, meet with providers, or wait while their loved one receives care. ICU Rooms The fourth floor of each Care Pavilion is dedicated to intensive care, which will substantially increase current ICU capacity. These rooms are designed to treat the highest-acuity patients, and each will offer the same amenities as regular patient rooms, including pull-out sleepers.
