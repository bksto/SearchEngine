Home Ask Submit Archive Telling UC Davis student stories RSS Major Decisions by Mandy Chew, Class of 2014, Double Major in Design and Economics When I applied to UC Davis, I was asked to declare a major. At the time, I did not know what I wanted to study. Should I go for something I have always excelled in? Or should I pursue something entirely new? Realistically, my logical and methodical way of thinking lends itself to the world of math and science which I enjoyed a great deal throughout high school. I loved the fact that I was always working towards a single correct answer. However, majoring in math or science did not feel like the correct answer to my dilemma. This was when my brother suggested design. At first, I was surprised by his suggestion. I knew very little about the field, and I was never a creative talent. And while I used to customize layouts and create banners for my online blog, my interest never grew beyond a childhood hobby. Even so, the thought began to appeal to me - how great would it be to turn a hobby into a future career? In the end, I decided to declare myself as a design major as an incoming freshman. After a few introductory courses, I fell in love. From the research and creative process to creating physical prototypes, design proved to be extremely fulfilling. I was able to interact with experienced professors and talented peers in small studio classes. The hands-on projects were stressful yet incredibly rewarding. I also found my logical side and math skills useful and applicable to the design field. While I did love design, my major decisions did not end there. During my first two years at UC Davis, I took a variety of courses to satisfy my general education requirements. From geology to sociology, I enrolled in courses I did not have the opportunity to take during high school. Eventually, I found potential in majoring in economics. In direct contrast to the creative demands of design, economics was more familiar to me. Numbers, theories, and facts were truths. I was able to confidently present my answers in economics, whereas in design, I was constantly faced with hundreds of wrong answers in the form of “bad designs.” Economics gave me the chance to learn more about the market and what makes it work (and not work) while letting me step back to catch my breath before diving into new design projects. Being able to switch between lectures and studio classes also gave my week a sense of variety. Every person will decide on their majors differently. For those who know what they want to study, it can be advantageous to declare early. However, it can also be limiting; in addition to general education degree requirements, UC Davis offers a diverse selection of courses that are meant to encourage students to explore and experience different fields. Take advantage of this - you never know what you might end up loving. thedeleteddrafts UCDavis, choosing college major, economics, design, 6th March 2015 Read more Peer Advisors Support Undergraduate Research By Erica Li, URC Peer Advisor Here at UC Davis, we pride ourselves in being one of the top research universities in the country. However, we could not have gotten to where we are without the help of undergraduates participating in research. To exemplify student work, the yearly Undergraduate Research Conference (May 1-2, 2015) gives students of all disciplines the opportunity to present the research they have been working on.  As a peer advisor at the Undergraduate Research Center, I encourage all students who come by to talk to me (Freshman through Seniors) while attending the conference. Even if they are not part of a research experience, they can use the conference as inspiration to find out what possibilities are out there. For those who are already involved in research, maybe seeing your peers presenting will motivate you to apply for next year’s conference! I became a peer advisor because I wanted to take my research experiences and guide students. It was also an opportunity to broaden my knowledge on the different fields and majors here at UC Davis. I have students from all backgrounds come speak to me and it has made me realize that regardless of what major someone is, the feelings of apprehension are still the same. No matter what someone’s career goals are, whether that’s finding a job after graduation or applying to graduate and medical programs, looking for research opportunities can be daunting. I am glad I can be a resource to help provide peace of mind and mitigate fearful feelings that you are too late to start research or that you don’t know how to start. It’s been incredibly rewarding to see people leave my office less stressed and with more guidance than when they came in. It reinforces in me every day that I made the right choice in becoming a peer advisor for undergraduate research. I get to work for a department that focuses solely on students and tries its hardest to provide resources. To make sure undergraduates always have the resources to conduct research, the Undergraduate Research Center is also putting on a 5K—The Genius RUN/Walk! All proceeds will go toward funding scholarships for undergraduate research!   Join us on May 3, 2015 at 9:30am (rain or shine) to enjoy a scenic route around the UC Davis campus.                                       Genius Walk Route Map Come dressed as your favorite genius and win awards! There will be an interactive activity where you get the chance to create a collaborative “pointillist,” finger painting masterpiece! This fun run is to help support undergraduates even more and allow everyone have a chance to do research during their college career. To find out more, including how to buy tickets, check out the Facebook event page. Register early and save! Online sales end midnight April 26, 2015. Registration is open to the public, and all ages are welcome to participate! All early registration participants will receive a free Genius RUN/walk T-shirt!

UC Davis offers a wide variety of research opportunities and related activities.  I encourage you all to take advantage of your resources and use your time here as a student to engage in discovery and the world of research! thedeleteddrafts 5th March 2015 Read more Falling in Love With Africa By Zoe Rossman    “When my alarm goes off at 5:30 a.m. I never have to hit snooze, because I know in just one short hour I’ll be standing outside the boma, work gloves in hand, watching Sally, the matriarch of the herd, lead her beautiful elephant family from the boma to the field. I lace up my work boots, grab a glass of mango juice, and then make the short trek down to the bunkhouse to begin my day. On the way I run into a herd of zebras who casually move out of my way as behind them the sun breaks brilliantly over one of South Africa’s many beautiful mountain ranges. Later, I’ll hop a tractor out to the field with volunteers from all around the world to spend the rest of my day among elephants.” This is how my morning started every day for five weeks this past summer.                                                 Thato & Mashudu “I’ve fallen in love with Africa, and I’m never coming back,” I proclaimed to family and friends, only one week after I arrived in South Africa to volunteer with the African Elephant Research Unit (AERU) at a small elephant reserve just ten minutes from the Pacific ocean. Well, I’m back in the U.S. now, but over the course of my five weeks in South Africa I fell head-over-heels for the elephants, the culture, the people, and the sense of freedom I got while traveling alone for the first time. How did I end up on the exact opposite side of the world? Mid-January 2014 I was sitting in my dorm room, surrounded by Chemistry 2B homework, and the only thing on my mind was getting as far away from California as possible. I asked myself “If I could be anywhere, doing anything, right now, what would I do?” Six months later, I was on a jumbo jet to Africa, not knowing just how much my trip would change my life.                                                Knysna, South Africa The craziest thing about Africa is that time goes slowly. This is epitomized by the South African phrase “Now now,” which you’d expect to mean “right away,” Nope. It literally translates to “later” or “when I have time.” Before I figured this out, I was constantly confused when I’d ask someone for assistance, to which they’d reply “Oh yeah, now now” and then turn and walk away! I’ll admit, having to wait an hour or two for a taxi or a meal really freaked me out the first week I was there. But after five weeks, I couldn’t imagine coming back to the fast-paced “immediate gratification” mentality that is ever-present in the United States. Having such a relaxed sense of time removes an immense amount of pressure and stress from day to day life. There are eleven official languages in South Africa. If you think that’s impressive, the head guide at the park, Mac, speaks twenty-eight languages and dialects. Twenty-eight. Many of the guides are from Zimbabwe, so they speak all the languages and dialects of Zimbabwe, as well as South Africa. On top of this, I volunteered with people from Poland, Germany, Portugal, and Spain, not to mention the tourists from all around the world who came to see the elephants. The languages of Xhosa, Zulu, and Afrikaans constantly surrounded me, among many others. Xhosa and Zulu are beautiful languages, accentuated with clicks in place of “x” “k” and “q.” Not being able to understand a lot of what was said became my norm, and I loved when I was able to pick up bits and pieces here and there.                                                  Thandi & Shungu One of the most amazing things about South Africa is that there seems to be no stigma against talking to strangers. On the whole, everyone seemed more friendly, open, and interested. Whether it was at the park, in a bar, or even on the beach, I got into countless conversations with people I’d never met before! This occurs much less frequently in the States, and often you need an “excuse” to start a conversation with someone, which was not the case in South Africa. So I fell in love with the languages and the people, but beyond anything else I fell in love with the elephants. I spent the majority of my time with “Sally’s herd” which was made up of Sally (the matriarch), Nandi, Thandi, Keisha, Thato, Mashudu, and Shungu. When I met them on my first day, I was overwhelmed-I’d hardly even seen elephants before, and now I was in the midst of seven of them! By the end of my time there I could tell them apart from hundreds of meters away just by how they were acting. I’ve never been around such intelligent, beautiful, and funny creatures, and recording data on their behavior was the most interesting task I’ve ever been given. I’ve always been interested in research on animal behavior, but I was never sure whether I wanted to teach, or work in a lab or in the field. After spending twelve hours a day with elephants, I am positive that field research is what I want to pursue.                                                             Sally There are so many places to go in the world that I’ve never felt any desire to return to somewhere I’ve already been. Until now. Five weeks was not enough time with Sally and her herd, and when I left I kept telling everyone over and over again “I’m going to come back.” And I am. Come June, I’ll be returning for three months to conduct my own research project with the elephants that stole my heart. My goal this summer is to study elephant-initiated human interactions; I see this as my opportunity to break into the field of elephant cognition, an area that I hope to explore further as I continue my education both at UC Davis and beyond. thedeleteddrafts southafrica, volunteering abroad, UC Davis, 4th March 2015 Read more Adventure A Day Away By Bryce Anable  The adventures that surround Davis are practically endless. The university is nestled in the heart of Northern California, with just a short drive to fun getaways.  A day trip makes for not only the perfect study break, but also a great way to spend quality time with friends. Whether its enjoying nature, a concert, or great food, students love taking advantage of surrounding adventures.  If you feel like your list of future adventures is running low, have no fear! Here is your perfect list to explore and enjoy the surroundings of Davis. All destinations are perfect for a day trip, as the drives are relatively short. If you have a car, grab some friends! If you don’t have a car, find a buddy with one and pitch gas and snacks to start your fun adventure away from school!  Many UC Davis students love being active in the outdoors. Perhaps the most common day trip that students take is a hike at Lake Berryessa! About twenty five miles out of Davis, the hikes are the perfect breath of fresh air during midterm stress. Check out these two hikes, depending on your desired difficulty level, and bring a picnic to enjoy the view!  Stebbins Cold Canyon Trail  This trail is a favorite among advanced hikers looking for a fairly rigorous adventure. The 4 mile path brings you to an elevation of 1500 feet with incredible views at the peak. North Berryessa End Trail  The North End trail is significantly easier than Stebbins Cold Canyon, making it the perfect hike for beginners looking for easy and relaxing exercise. Though the easiness makes the elevation relatively limited, the views of the lake are still wonderful and clear. Look out for wildlife, as hikers have seen bald eagles before!  The next Saturday you’re looking for something fun to do, check out Pops in the Park in East Sacramento! Pops in the Park boasts free concerts and entertainment to everybody who attends. The sponsorship profits, advertising dollars, and proceeds from food and beverages fund the event and help the Sacramento community; funds enhance parks, bring improvements to the neighborhood and provide youth athletic scholarships.  If you’re a dog lover searching for a getaway for you and your furry friend, take a drive to Alston Park in Napa Valley! About fifty miles away, the destination is a bit of a drive, but the beautiful expanse of the park makes it well worth it.  The massive park has an off-leash dog area where pups are given the freedom to run around and make new buddies. Your dog will thank you, and you’ll get to enjoy the day too.  For those of you willing to drive a longer distance for an amazing opportunity, head over to Off the Grid in San Francisco. It’s about an hour and a half drive from Davis, but a car full of friends makes the distance fly by.  Off the Grid is located throughout San Francisco, and make sure to check out the Fort Mason location for live music every Friday night. Starting again on March 6th, Off the Grid is California’s largest weekly evening street food market. Choose from 32 food truck options and enjoy food, friends, and good music!  Make sure to let us know about all the fun you had on your next adventure! We would also love to hear about the different trips you have taken as a student at UC Davis! Happy travels! banable 25th February 2015 Read more Calling All Literature Lovers By Shai Nielson If you are a book lover, read on.

All of these are absolutely phenomenal aspects of the program. However, the way I was most able to grow as an individual while I was abroad in Sydney, Australia. was learning how to be independent.  I have the walking disaster act perfected. If there is a way for me to forget the single most important thing, I will. Mix up baking soda and baking powder in a recipe? Been there. Set an alarm for 6:00 PM instead of AM? Sounds like me. When you’re living abroad, you’re the one in charge of yourself. Sounds scary, maybe, but I learned just how capable I really am. Perhaps the most significant epiphany I had about this was when I went on a cruise of the Great Barrier Reef. It was 2 days and 1 night of snorkeling/scuba diving at two different sites. Altogether, I snorkeled 3 times and did one intro dive (see above). I swam alongside a sea turtle, was swarmed by multicolored fish, floated among beautiful coral, and basically just pretended to be a mermaid. Ever the disastrous traveler, here’s a brief (feel free to contact me if you have a spare couple hours and would like the in-depth version) overview of mishaps that happened on the weekend away: 1.   I forgot my camera battery. Camera, of course. Lens, got it. Memory card (which I have already learned my lesson on forgetting to replace after uploading pictures), yup. Charge battery so as to have maximum photographing time, check. Leave battery in said charger, you better believe it. 2.   I (almost) lost my cell phone charger and (almost) was phoneless and (actually was) alone. While on a brief (totally safe, don’t fret Mom and Dad) solo adventure to a market, I brilliantly brought a portable charger so as to maintain contact with the rest of my group even while alone. Of course, the charging cable somehow managed to wiggle its way into the hidden depths of my backpack, leaving me with 1% to spare by the time I met up with my travel buddies. 3. The airport was closed for cleaning for the 4 hours my travel buddies and I decided would best be spent roughing it at the gate rather than sleeping at a hostel. Do you know what makes for 5 tired, cold, hungry travelers? Waiting outside an airport until 4 am, huddled against an abstract rock structure (covered only by the beachwear and beach towels they brought for a sunny weekend away) in an attempt to hide from the wind. See what I mean? Hot mess doesn’t begin to describe it. Individual growth is by far one of the most important reasons we are here at UC Davis, studying like crazy. Yes, we need those degrees and internships and extracurricular activities. Studying abroad absolutely grows your academics and professional skills. However, it also puts you in situations that test you as an individual.  Head over to the UC Davis Study Abroad page and check out the fabulous places you could explore. thatssoaubvious 25th February 2015 Read more Fighting off The Winter Blues By Sophia Plessier Winter quarter can be really hard.  The Holidays cheers are long over, and it is time for you to start that New Year. Coming back to Davis, you realize the campus is more crowed than you remembered it to be and the days are shorter than you expected. School is at full speed, and your workload has increased from last quarter. To top it all off, it is so cold outside that you much rather stay in your warm cozy bed than have to face the storm outside. You slowly start getting into a funk, and you start to believe that life is just too hard. DO NOT PANIC! This is very common for a lot of students, especially during winter quarter due to the cold weather, the lack of daylight, and the course load. Yet there are many ways for you to get out of that funk and go back to being your happy self. 1.     Exercise We know going to the gym right now may not be ideal but it is necessary to beat that negative energy that is surrounding you. Since the days are shorter and you experience less daylight, your body will automatically feel fatigued and it may become difficult for you to carry on with your daily routine. When exercising, your brain releases endorphins, which are chemicals in your body that makes you energetic and happy. Find a workout buddy and start going to the ARC, or start going on jogs through the beautiful Arboretum. 2.     Drink a lot of water As basic as it may sound, drinking water is crucial. During winter our skin becomes fragile to the weather and gets dried out easily. Not only will drinking water rehydrate you but also it helps maintain a healthy looking skin and energizes your muscles.  With over 28 water hydration stations on campus, it is easy to stay healthy and hydrate. 3.     Join new clubs on campus Fall quarter was probably really hectic and you did not have enough time to join a club. Now that you are familiar with the university, go check out The Quad and see all the great clubs we have here on campus. With over 650 different types of student organizations, you will find a place where you fit right in. if you want to browse all the different types of clubs we have, check out: http://admissions.ucdavis.edu/about/student_life/clubs.cfm 4.     Dedicate one night every 2 weeks as your “treat night” Sometimes you just need to stop caring about everything that is going on and have a “ME Moment”. Take the time to take care of your body and mind. From a new hairdo to a bubble bath and watching your favorite movie, take the time to spoil yourself. I am not saying for you to binge on Netflix, but think of something that you have always wanted to do and finally just DO IT! You should check out the free 10 minutes massage chairs at the Mind Spa at the North Hall location. Most important part: TURN OFF YOUR PHONE and disconnect yourself from the world. This is your moment; you’ve earned it. 5.     Go on a “Friend Date” You would be surprised but your friends are probably also feeling a little down too. If you are single, you are even more down because you don’t have anyone to cuddle with during those cold winter nights but you know what, who cares? You are young and smart; you don’t need a significant other right now. All you need are some good friends, five dollars, and some awesome bowling skills. UC Davis is very special because unlike other schools, we have our own bowling alley underneath the MU. Games are super cheap and it is always a good way to relieve some stress. If you are not too good at bowling, that’s fine too! Go checkout the restaurants downtown, you would be surprised at all the amazing food we have here at Davis. And if that is still not cheering you up, go take a day trip with a good friend to San Francisco and just explore the city. Stay positive and healthy and those winter blues will be gone before you know it. smplessier 19th February 2015 Read more My First On-Campus Job This is part 1 in a series of posts about one student’s experience at UC Davis working at on-campus jobs. By Miranda Bard “Your budget is $5 per day—so $35 dollars per week,” said my mother over the phone. Immediately Iogged onto Aggie Job Link to find a job.  I was 18 years old, in my second quarter at UC Davis, and in desperate want of financial freedom. My work experience was limited to babysitting and helping my dad with catering events, and as Communication major, I really had no idea what I wanted to do. I applied to a broad range of jobs, some of which would provide me solely with funds—waitressing, babysitting—as well as jobs that would contribute to helping me decide what I wanted to be when I grew up.  After much searching and not too much luck, the president of the UC Davis student government, ASUCD, hired me as the Publicity Director, with a stipend of $35 per week. To be honest, I was slightly disappointed that the stipend matched the budget my mom had given me, but more than anything I was thrilled to be more involved at UC Davis. So began my journey as an on-campus student worker. Working on campushas been one of the most important parts of my college experience, and over thecourse of my final months at UC Davis, I will be documenting them for you. Currently I am a senior at UC Davis, though students usually refer to our class standing by how many years we have been here—so I am a fourth year, staying an extra quarter to intern in Washington, DC (more about that in a later post). I came in as a Communication major, with a vague idea about being competent enough with people and computers to go into marketing. After taking Sociology 1, a pre-requisite for the Communication major, I fell in love with it, and decided to double-major in Sociology—Organizational Studies. It fit well with the Communication major, with some classes overlapping, and both focusing on how individuals interact with each other and the society around them. This experience just goes to show how vital lower-division, general education courses can be in setting you on a path that you never even considered. But enough about me and my majors (for now), and more about my first job at UC Davis. I was hired during the second-to-last quarter of Adam Thongsavat’s presidency. My interview took place in a board room with Adam and his staff asking me questions about my prior work experience, my expectations of working for ASUCD, and if I could be any kind of cooking utensil, what would I be (look up Top 25 Oddball Interview Questions for more of these) I was most intimidated by Kat, who was very put together and attentive. She ended up becoming one of my best friends. Eunice seemed too busy to have time for me—I did not find out until later that she was a Civil Engineering major (they are hard core), as well as a loyal friend and an extremely fun person to party with. Adrian seemed like a fun, interesting guy, but I was not too sure if we would connect. However, the following year he asked me to help him start a newspaper on campus, and I became one of the editors as well as the person he discussed all of his decisions with. A photo of the girls on the staff, including Kat (far left) & Eunice (second from right).  The truth is, at the end of my three months working for ASUCD, I did not learn much and I was not very close with any of the staff members. There were not a lot of times that we were all in the office together, and there were not many tasks for me to do (my job was to post on the ASUCD Facebook and Twitter and brief Adam about current events in Davis.) The important thing about this first job was not that I contributed a lot to ASUCD or even learned much. Rather, it gave me a taste of being involved on campus, gave me something to discuss during my next job interview, and afforded me three amazing people who have become lifelong friends. Stay tuned for my first REAL job on campus, as well as more about the newspaper we started. thembshow 18th February 2015 Read more Safe Rides just got safer By Sophia Plessier Student safety is a priority for the UC Davis Police Department and they strive every year to make this campus safer than the previous. Through new programs and adjustments of old ones, the UCDPD is proud to show off their refurbished escort service, Safe Rides. Safe Rides is a service that is offered to all students at UC Davis and it provides secure rides from campus-to-campus destinations. These rides are given everyday from the hours of 5 to 10 p.m.  What makes Safe Rides extra safe is that the drivers are able to actually drive on the on-campus roads, making it even easier for students to get picked up from various locations. The new feature of the program is that now a student can request a ride from anywhere on campus to any location in Davis. This can be done by calling or by using the new app, “TapRide.” This app was developed for smartphones so students can more easily request rides. All you have to do is download TapRide from an app store, pick your school, sign into your UC Davis account, and request a pick up and drop off location. The best part about Safe Rides, though, is that all the drivers are students. This really reinforces the sense of community that one can find at UC Davis with the “students helping other students” ideals that the school values. Personal Experience As a senior, I remember using Safe Rides multiple times a week as a freshman. Especially during winter quarter, where the nights would be miserably cold and dark, I would call Safe Rides from inside the library and they would come pick me up in front of the doors and drop me off right in front of my dorm. This made me feel safe and secure, and I knew I could trust the drivers. The first time I called, I was nervous to get in a car with strangers. I would always walk back to my dorm by myself but eventually it would get too late and cold. I remembered hearing about Safe Rides during my orientation so I called and they told me they would be there in 5 minutes. The process was very easy: I had to give them my name, my Student ID, and my location. Once I got in the van, I was quiet, shy, and very nervous until I realized that the workers were students. They were really friendly and were asking me simple questions to break the ice. They made it feel safe and comfortable. After that occurrence, I would use Safe Rides whenever I didn’t want to walk home by myself. I became friends with the drivers and they would give me advice about activities to do and what classes to take. Not every school offers you programs such as Safe Rides. Being a young woman, I’ve been faced with dangerous situations when it comes to walking home alone at night, but UCDPD really tries to make this campus safe and allows young adults, like me, to make it home safely. smplessier 12th February 2015 Read more Ask An Aggie! By Bryce Anable As a coveted research university praised for its diverse student body, UC Davis offers endless opportunities to its friendly students. While the town of Davis is a college student’s haven, the campus also revolves around student enjoyment and comfort; the university campus is just as friendly and exciting as its welcoming student body. Hundreds of clubs and registered organizations provide an intimate sense of community for those searching for a place to call home. The 5,300 acre campus is filled with not only cozy study nooks, but also lively areas for students to socialize and meet new people. UC Davis offers this sense of home to each of its students.  Every student may find a unique place or exciting aspect of the large campus. I decided to discover just a few of these places that make UC Davis an exceptional place for each individual student. I walked under the large oak trees that line the campus quad as light rain drizzled on a foggy Friday. With a pen and paper in hand, I asked students the simple, yet riveting, question: What about UC Davis is special to you that most people do not know about? Steven Lam, a first year biochemistry major, explains his passion and excitement for the UC Davis Activities and Recreational Center (ARC). He says,  “One of the things that I appreciate most about this school is the ARC. I spend most of my time there because I am an athlete and I think it’s really cool how they upgraded it and made it look nicer for people to spend more time there.” The Activities and Recreational Center, pictured above, offers all UC Davis students a to workout and be active with fellow peers. Free to all UC Davis students, the facility offers countless opportunities, such as a climbing wall, indoor track and daily student-led workout classes (http://tinyurl.com/k3ua9ty) Lucy Rollins, a third year environmental policy, analysis and planning major, hopped off her bike to rave about her favorite spot on campus, the Coffee House, otherwise known as the CoHo. Rollins explains, “Something at Davis that is special to me is being able to sit at the CoHo at a booth, because I love the booths, and just people watching and seeing so many different types of people. But you also know so many of them and recognize so many of them, knowing that you can be a part of something so big with so many different types of people.” As the most popular dining facility on UC Davis campus, the coffee house provides hundreds of seating options, making it a go-to study and hangout spot for students. The facility’s website states that the employees “pledge to provide each of our guests with a unique and inviting dining experience, focused on fresh, delicious, made-form-scratch menu options prepared and served by students for UC Davis and the community at large” (coffeehouse.ucdavis.edu). Stephanie Landes, a third year Chinese, reflects on the impactful classes that UC Davis offers, saying, “Davis is special because the classes really get you involved and thinking about the world in different ways. I feel like my view towards what I want to do in my life and who I am as a person has changed so much as a person. I think my classes have really evolved who I am and what I think.” With over 100 majors and endless class options, every UC Davis student is sure to find a topic of interest.
