To access the SLR, new students must have first submitted their Statement of Intent to Register (SIR). Upon submission of your SLR, the Residency Deputy will review it to determine if you are AB540 eligible, if so, you will be mailed an AB540 Application/Affidavit from the Residency Deputy. Once you receive the AB540 Application/Affidavit in the mail, you will fill out the Application/Affidavit and mail it to the Residency Deputy along with proof of eligibility. It will generally take a few weeks for your status to be updated.   UCSB Office of the Registrar University of California, Santa Barbara 1101 Student Affairs and Administrative Services Building (SAASB) Santa Barbara, CA 93106-2015 (805) 893-3592 Copyright © 2015 The Regents of the University of California, All Rights Reserved.
