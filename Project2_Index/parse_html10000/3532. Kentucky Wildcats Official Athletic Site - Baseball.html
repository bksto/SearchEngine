In fact, every coach in the 38-year history of Kentucky women's basketball has had at least one Southeastern Conference loss to teach from seven games into conference.::Read More [+] After early struggles at the line, Cats hit 'em when they count January 21, 2012 With missed free throws stacking on top of missed free throws, the groans among the 24,246 fans in attendance in Rupp Arena were becoming louder and louder. In spite of hitting just 12-of-22 shots from the line late in the second half, Kentucky maintained a tenuous three-point lead over visiting Alabama. To hold onto that lead, it was plainly clear the Wildcats would need to convert from the stripe to defeat a physical Crimson Tide team.::Read More [+] Robic's Riddle: Double-double edition January 21, 2012 It's time once again for our regular trivia contest before men's basketball games: Robic's Riddle. Assistant coach John Robic has supplied us with yet another question from the annals of Kentucky basketball history.

Could the 2010-11 Kentucky Wildcats win a close game? Could they answer the bell in a raucous road environment? Did they have the necessary toughness to make a run in March?::Read More [+] Notes: First SEC road trip upcoming for UK January 10, 2012 It was relatively quiet at Tuesday afternoon's men's basketball media availability, as John Calipari and select players spoke before Kentucky (15-1, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) heads south for the Wildcats' first SEC road game against Auburn (10-5, 0-1 SEC)::Read More [+] Notebook: Calipari, Cats open road SEC schedule January 9, 2012 John Calipari and the other 11 coaches from around the Southeastern Conference joined the league weekly teleconference on Monday.

The first fan to submit a correct answer via email to catscratches@uky.edu will receive a mystery prize::Read More [+] Calipari measuring team by more than wins and losses heading into SEC play January 6, 2012 John Calipari makes no effort to hide his distaste for losing. It's probably close to impossible for a coach to rise to the pinnacle of the college ranks as Calipari has without that kind of hatred of falling short on the scoreboard, but the third-year Kentucky head coach is finding himself battling his instincts::Read More [+] Bishop boosts Wildcats in hard-fought defeat of Arkansas January 5, 2012 Azia Bishop certainly got her money's worth on Thursday night. Due to foul trouble and her team's depth in the post, the freshman played limited minutes in Kentucky's 84-73 win over Arkansas in Memorial Coliseum. In fact, she was on the floor for just two minutes in the first half. However, she wasn't about to let that her affect her approach::Read More [+] With SEC slate underway, the training wheels are off for UK Hoops January 5, 2012 Kentucky's Southeastern Conference opener was not for the faint of heart. Baskets were at a premium as the Wildcats prevailed 59-56 in a physical and low-scoring affair against Florida. Each and every loose ball was contested as the two teams grabbed a nearly equal share of the 86 rebounds that careened off the rims in Gainesville, Fla.::Read More [+] Davis, Kidd-Gilchrist doing the bulk of UK's dominant board work January 3, 2012 It was just a week ago that John Calipari lamented the fact that his team was too reliant on Anthony Davis and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist to rebound. The two highly touted freshmen were fresh off a game in which they combined to grab 19 of Kentucky's 36 rebounds. Calipari issued a call to the rest of the Wildcats to step up::Read More [+] As Camp Cal enters final week, Cats still focused on improving January 2, 2012 For two solid weeks, it's been all basketball, all the time for John Calipari's Kentucky Wildcats, as they've capitalized on a break from classes and lifted restrictions on practice time. Unquestionably, UK has benefited from the time, but with a week left before the start of the spring semester, the work is far from complete. ::Read More [+] Davis shakes off fouls, provides second-half boost in win over Louisville December 31, 2011 For the majority of the first half, Anthony Davis was just like the 24,387 fans in Rupp Arena: a spectator. He watched as Kentucky grabbed a 15-point lead with just over five minutes left in the first half, only to see archrival Louisville storm back to close the deficit to 36-33 at halftime. He watched as Michael Kidd-Gilchrist dominated to the tune of 16 points and eight rebounds::Read More [+] Robic's Riddle: Double figure scorers edition December 31, 2011 It's time once again for our regular trivia contest before men's basketball games: Robic's Riddle.

If ever there were a time for one of those foul moods, you would have thought it would be in the wake of his team's disappointing defeat this week on the road against Middle Tennessee State. The Blue Raiders upset the sixth-ranked Wildcats in a decisive 70-58 win in which UK failed to bring the necessary intensity and effort to make its high-pressure style of play successful::Read More [+] The Scratchies (Winter 2011) December 29, 2011 While occupying his post in charge of Cat Scratches, Eric Lindsey debuted the Scratchies, a set of awards given for the best performances in UK Athletics for the preceding semester. I wasn't sure at first whether I would continue the tradition, but once I found just how quiet it gets around here during the holidays, I decided it was time to give out some hardware (or maybe I should say "software", since there are no physical awards to be given)::Read More [+] Calipari can't afford to sit Kidd-Gilchrist December 29, 2011 John Calipari is steadfast in enforcing his rule of sitting a player who picks up two early fouls for the balance of the first half. Superstar or role player, Calipari refuses to put anyone in a position to pick up a third foul before halftime, regardless of the situation::Read More [+] Robic's Riddle: Lamar edition December 28, 2011 It's time once again for our regular trivia contest before men's basketball games: Robic's Riddle.

The first fan to submit a correct answer via email to catscratches@uky.edu will receive a prize::Read More [+] Wildcats directing full focus to Lamar December 27, 2011 With the release of the latest polls on Monday, it became official. For the first time in the history of the Kentucky-Louisville rivalry, the annual matchup will feature two top-five teams, but even if UK and UofL weren't ranked in the top 105, the hype already would have started::Read More [+] Wiltjer's offense spurs UK in victory, defense still a work in progress December 22, 2011 A few minutes into the second half in a game against Loyola (Md.), Kentucky held a slim five-point lead. The crowd of 22,774 in Rupp Arena was beginning to get a little anxious as UK played a rare mid-week early afternoon game and the visiting Greyhounds were showing no signs of fading::Read More [+] Best of Blue Weekly Awards (week of Oct. 31) October 31, 2011 It can be hard to keep up with everything going on in the University of Kentucky's 22 varsity sports.

On defense, the Cats forced three turnovers, scored a defensive touchdown and allowed less than 300 yards.Read More [+] Crucial SEC weekend ahead for UK volleyball October 27, 2011 Following a stretch of three consecutive road games, the Kentucky volleyball team returns home for a pair of key matches in Memorial Coliseum against SEC East foes South Carolina and No. 13 Florida. The road trip that just wrapped up began inauspiciously, as UK fell to Mississippi State in front of a record crowd.
