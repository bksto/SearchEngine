Endowment Gifts If you want to offer long-term support for the University of Illinois, you should consider an endowed gift. Through an endowment, your gift is invested and pays out a yearly distribution, which goes to support an area of your preference. Many times, endowed gifts go to support the most important assets of the University, our students and faculty, by providing scholarship, fellowship and professorship support. A minimum amount is required to establish an endowment. However, an endowment can be built up with smaller gifts over a period of time. For more details about establishing an endowment, contact Director of Stewardship at 217-333-2975 or kaschmid@illinois.edu. Honorary/Memorial Gifts You can pay tribute to a valued family member, friend, classmate, or faculty member with a gift. Honorary or Memorial gifts are a thoughtful way to remember a loved one while supporting an area of importance to them. Your Honorary or Memorial gift can be made anytime either by mail, online or phone. Please indicate who the gift honors or memorializes at that time. For a more permanent gift such as an endowment, please contact Alex Schmidt, Director of Stewardship at 217-333-2975 or kaschmid@illinois.edu. Planned Gifts You may want to consider making a planned gift to the University, which can offer financial benefits through income and estate tax savings and arrangements that provide lifetime income. Planned gifts include assets, bequests in a will, charitable gift annuities, charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, retirement plans, and life insurance policies.
