Instead, it’s about the college philosophy and your own personality. Our six-college system was modeled after the centuries-old arrangement at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the UK. You will room, dine, socialize and study with students from every major within your chosen college; and take classes with students from every college campus. You’ll have access to all of the powerful resources of this large research university with additional support services from your college. When you fill out your UC application for admission, you’re asked to rank the colleges in order of preference.
