Its activities directly address the major goal in the campus' formal Academic Planning Statement, "Ensure Excellence in Both Undergraduate and Graduate Instruction". The mission of Instructional Development is to foster a climate for excellence in instruction, which parallels the climate for excellence in research, within the context of a world class institution of higher education. The mission is addressed by following a model which has evolved over the past two decades. The organizational structure and functioning of Instructional Development reflects the model. The organization has a substantial impact on the quality of instruction offered at UCSB. It is able to address comprehensively and effectively the needs of a faculty which teaches a tremendous range of subject matter, using a wide range of teaching philosophies, methods, styles, and technologies. The key elements required to address effectively this diversity of faculty needs include: instructional consulting and evaluation; technical media production support; and technical media display support.
