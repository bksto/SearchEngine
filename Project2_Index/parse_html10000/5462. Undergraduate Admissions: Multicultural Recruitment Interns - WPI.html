The program gave me a small taste of what college life was all about. Before Envision I was afraid of having to start over, make new friends, a new environment and a completely new beginning. At the Envision program, I met current and other admitted students, including my future roommate and now best friend. The people were very welcoming and friendly and made me feel at home. By the end of the program, I felt as if I had known them for years. Ivette Carino Contact Information Bartlett Center Ivette Carino Class of 2015 Chemical Engineering Hometown: Bronx, NY Activities: Phi Sigma Sigma, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Connections Program, Big Brothers Big Sisters When applying to college, WPI stood out to me for the unique project experiences it offers. This past fall semester I spent 7 weeks in Cape Town, South Africa through WPI’s Global Perspective Program. I was part of a group project that aimed to improve water, sanitation and hygiene provisions in informal settlements in the Cape Town area. It was an unforgettable and rewarding experience. I worked and formed relationships with community members, immersed myself in a new culture, and learned more about myself as an individual and team player. I could not have had the same experience at another university. I was lucky enough to work on a pressing global issue and gain a new cultural experience. Lailah Thompson Contact Information Bartlett Center Lailah Thompson Class of 2016 Industrial Engineering Activities: Peer Academic Coach, Membership Director of Institute of Industrial Engineers, Tutor & Mentor at African Community Education, Connections Mentor, Trustee Mentor-Mentee Program, Lifeguard, Office of Multicultural Affairs I came to WPI because of the school environment. Unlike many technical colleges where it is very competitive, WPI has managed to established a friendly community where anyone can ask and receive help. I can ask any person on campus, whether I know them or not, for help and they will take the time to help. The students and faculty at WPI all want everyone to succeed. Aside from the attitude of the community is the abundance of resources available. WPI made me feel comfortable especially during my overnight stay, which lead me to pick this college is my primary choice.   Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Academic Programs WPI At-a-Glance Living at WPI Your Perspective Applying to WPI Visit with Us Meet the Team Meet the Staff Engineering Ambassadors Meet the Admissions Interns Crimson Key Tour Guides Multicultural Recruitment Interns Information Sessions & Campus Tours Saturday Visits Open Houses Personal Interviews Office Hours and Parking BEANS Virtual Tour Online College Fairs Pre-College Opportunities Request Information Admissions Calendar + There are currently no events in the calendar.
