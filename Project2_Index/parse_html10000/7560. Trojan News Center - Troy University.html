Read More Exhibit at TROY focuses on teens in the Holocaust Posted: Monday, 09 February 2015 TROY - A travelling exhibit on display in Troy University's Lurleen B. Wallace Library sheds light on the experiences of teenagers during the Holocaust. "Parallel Journeys: World War II and the Holocaust through the Eyes of Teens" will be on display on the library's main floor. The display tells the stories of six teenagers who were witnesses, participants and, often, victims of World War II and the Holocaust. Although Anne Frank is one of the most famous teenagers in history, with her diary translated into more than 67 languages, her story alone does not document the complexity of the war. The testimonies document different experiences of the war. Featured in the exhibit is Frank, Olympian Margaret Lambert and Adolf Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge, as well as other teens and young adults who survived the concentration camps, hid from the Nazis, led rescue efforts, served as soldiers, remained on the home front or aided individuals who were targets of Nazi oppression.

Launched in 2002, the Conference is co-sponsored by the University and the City of Troy and seeks to promote dialogue that fosters multicultural collaboration and equip diverse leaders with the tools to better serve their organizations and communities. The theme of this year's conference is "A Century of Achievement: A Salute to African American History and Culture." "Most of us live lives that are much smaller than we were intended to live because we lack passion; we lack energy," Harper told the crowd gathered in Sartain Hall on the Troy Campus. "If we see an issue or a problem that needs to be changed, energy is required to change it. There is potential energy within all of us. We must turn that potential energy into radiant energy - the energy of light. We have the potential to shine light on the injustice in the world and bring light to the places of darkness."
