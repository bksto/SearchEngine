There will be a survey to complete at the end of the orientation. There are no certificates of completion.  View the CHC Assessment Calendar and choose a day/time for assessment.  Then, click on the calendar day you choose for more information on CHC Assessment. *Be sure to arrive fully prepared as you will only be able to test once in two (2) years.
