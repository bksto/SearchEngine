Rice wired network- plug in your ethernet cable or console for the fastest and most consistent connection to the Internet. Rice Owls wireless network- requires a NetID login, provides fast Internet connections on a private network available only to Rice faculty, staff and students. Rice Visitor wireless network- a public wireless connection to the Internet, requires agreeing to Rice's Acceptable Use Policy; heavy traffic results in slower speed and inconsistencies. VPN- using a VPN (virtual private network) connection allows your computer or mobile device to access resources that are restricted to faculty, staff and students on the Rice campus network.  A VPN connection makes it easy for you to continue working while living off-campus or traveling. Regional and Global Networks Although Rice is affiliated with many organizations, the external networks most used by faculty and staff include eduroam, LEARN, and XSEDE. eduroam - a global, members-only wireless network for higher education institutions; requires NetID login and works at Rice as well as at other member institutions, including the University of Houston. See the full list of eduroam institutions at https://www.eduroam.us/. LEARN - Lonestar Education and Research Network - a high speed, members-only network of Texas institutions; any communications or data you exchange with other member institutions automatically uses this network. XSEDE - a members-only network for research-focused universities; contact the Research Computing Support Group (RCSG) to access XSEDE. Docs.rice.edu includes instructions on connecting your computer or mobile device to the wired and wireless campus networks.
