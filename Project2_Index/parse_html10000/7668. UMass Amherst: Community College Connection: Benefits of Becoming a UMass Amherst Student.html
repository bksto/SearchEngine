They also benefit from attending and graduating from the state’s flagship university and one of the nation’s premier research institutions. UMass Amherst students choose from 93 areas of academic study, including interdisciplinary majors and the individually designed BDIC (bachelor's degree with individual concentration). Many of our programs are among the top ranked in the country, most notably the writing, engineering, business, linguistics, and computer science programs. Our students take classes at no extra cost at Amherst, Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire Colleges through the Five College Interchange, expanding their opportunities four-fold. Their hard work shows: UMass Amherst is the only New England public university designated as a top producer of Fulbright scholars. UMass Amherst faculty are MacArthur, Guggenheim, and Sloan Fellows, Fulbright Scholars, and Pulitzer Prize winners. Their research—green energy, nanotechnology, biomechanics—brings more than $150 million to the university. They incorporate this research directly into their teaching, and our undergraduates regularly participate in their lab work, research projects, and studios. Our teaching and research facilities are state of the art, and include new buildings for studio art, life and chemical sciences, and laboratory science. Students also benefit from our new recreation center, dining commons, apartment-style residence halls, and the Learning Commons at the WEB Du Bois Library. Our hometown of Amherst is ranked “the best college town in America.” Our students participate in nearly 250 student organizations, cheer on our NCAA Division I athletes, and enjoy the best college dining in the country, according to the Daily Beast. They take advantage of extensive opportunities in internships, co-ops, and study abroad to broaden their experience and prepare for graduate work or careers. Their passion for community service has been honored by the Carnegie Foundation, the Princeton Review, and the Presidents Higher Education Community Service Roll. All this, at a university called one of the best educational values in the county by Kiplinger’s Magazine and SmartMoney.
