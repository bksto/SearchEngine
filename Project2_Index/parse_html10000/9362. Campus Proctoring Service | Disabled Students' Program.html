Proctoring Services are available to courses with five or more students requiring accommodations. However, all requests are taken into consideration. Keep in mind, there is limited space available to Proctoring Services, especially during finals. Please notify Proctoring Services when requesting accommodations for students if your department has available space, as it may be necessary to use for proctoring purposes. The Disabled Students' Program offers a centralized, year-round service to assist faculty by locating space and providing proctors. You can submit a request for assistance to the Campus Proctoring Service. Faculty or instructors can designate a GSI or other department staff to coordinate their request. While the Campus Proctoring Service will do everything it can to help you, there may be occasions when space and proctors are fully booked. Therefore, please contact the Proctoring Service as soon as you can.   Campus Proctoring Service Deadlines Fall/Spring Midterms and Quizzes: 2 weeks prior to the regularly scheduled exam/quiz Final Exam Deadlines: Fall Semester—November 1 Spring Semester—April 2   Requesting the Service Our staff is part-time and proctors are hired and paid on an hourly basis, specifically for your exam.
