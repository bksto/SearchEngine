By Hannah Jacobson On March 3, 2015 Tweet Pin It Remembering 9/11 courtesy by http://www.teachmedia.org Dr. Theresa Saliba, a professor of much acclaim at Evergreen State College, was recently at Cal State L.A. to discuss Middle Eastern feminism in the light of post-9/11 discrimination. Saliba was driven to analyze the effect of discrimination on Middle Eastern women after watching the country’s security landscape undergo a massive transformation post 9/11, and how the nation is still struggling with the aftermath of changed perceptions. “Since most terrorist suspects were males, there hasn’t been a lot of research on what has happened to women and families due to these new policies of surveillance, detention, and deportations,” Saliba says about her motivations for the study. While men are considered a threat to physical security, Saliba reveals that the idea of women in hijabs is seen as a cultural threat, as rejecting American freedoms for ‘dangerous’ foreign morals. “Women in headscarves have been targeted for hate crimes, and these acts against Muslim-Americans had skyrocketed in 2001,” says Saliba. The alarming fact is that these hate crimes continue even in 2015. Last month, three Muslim college students, Omar Abdel-Baky, 24, his 21-year old wife Yusor Abu-Salha, and her 19-year old sister Razan Abu-Salha were shot dead by their neighbor in Chapell Hill, North Carolina. Saliba explains, “Culture wars seem to point to a consistent refueling of anti-Muslim sentiment and today we have the issues of ISIS, the attack against Charlie Hebdo, and movies like American Sniper [that] continue triggering and furthering the negative response against Muslim Americans.” The Obama Administration surpassed two million deportations in 2014 while pledging a softer attitude to immigrant children and to those who have been in the U.S. for more than five years. “Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who’s working hard to provide for her kids,” Obama said in a speech on November 20th, 2014. Contradictingly, an estimated 60,000 Muslims were deported from the U.S. under the Obama administration by 2014, with only 30,000 being deported on terrorist grounds. “Case studies show that some of these ‘terrorist grounds’ are actually quite flimsy,” adds Saliba. One of her case studies on the Hamoui family tells this different story the U.S. government’s ideals. After being forced from their house at dawn, the daughter and mother of the Hamoui family were held in a center – the same that the Japanese were subjected to post Pearl Harbor – for nine months while the father was held for ten months. “When the community protested against the detainment of this family, the protest was used as the pretext for punishment,” Saliba described, “The family would be taken down to an area in the detention center called ‘the hole’.” In addition, the mother, Nadine Hamoui, did not receive proper medical care for a serious condition called Crohn's disease while being held. Numerous violations have occurred in these detention centers, leading to scores of immigrant deaths in detention since 2001. “What Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials call ‘the death roster’ stands at 104 since October 2003,” writes a 2009 article by the New York Times. The United States has honed a vast network of for-profit Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. A policy known as the ‘bed quote’ requires ICE to hold an average of 34,000 individuals in detention daily. “They receive $112 a night for every bed that is filled. These detention centers serve as a controlling force for Arab and Muslim communities,” reports Saliba, “Those outside of detention centers still find themselves in virtual camps because of the current surveillance system.” Nadine Hamoui spoke out against the detention center that held her for 9 months, but these protests simply caused it to shut down while a new one was quietly erected in Tacoma, Washington; few residents of Tacoma are even aware of its existence. The security policies move American citizens to accept more authoritarian, paternalistic powers and allow these acts to persist under the populations’ radar for injustice. Practices like these always end up impacting the fabric of society negatively, and pushes it in a regressive mode rather than progressive. Saliba continues her efforts to spread awareness on the issue; hopefully the scenario will improve soon and we will learn to grow beyond it as a nation.
