Cookies As with many Websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make the Site easier to use by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences.

The Site reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. We do this to offer more targeted products and services to you and to customize and enhance your online experience on the site. We will not provide individual data but will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties, unless you consent to such use. In addition, the Site reserves the right to contact a subscriber regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement and other matters that relate to the underlying service and/or the information collected, regardless of whether the user has opted out of promotional activities on the site. WITH WHOM THE INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED At times, we may share your personally identifiable information with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others: Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

These entities only access the personally identifiable information to perform their functions, but may not use the information for other purposes.

When you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, you may be taken to a different Web site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and others that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. SECURITY This Site incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration, such as Secure Sockets Layer or "SSL" and firewalls, to ensure that your information is secure and confidential. Certain personally identifiable information, such as credit card information, is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information to carry out business functions are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required. Many areas on the Site require a password. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. It is important to recognize that whatever you transmit or disclose online could be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY The Site is a general audience site. We do not currently collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen. If in the future, the Site knowingly collects personally identifiable information from children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) including, without limitation, obtaining necessary parental consents. The Internet offers many entertaining and educational opportunities for children. Parental guidance and supervision is necessary to ensure a safe and rewarding online experience. A number of interactive features on the Site require registration to participate or will require registration in the future to participate (e.g. site registration/customization, Gametracker, promotions). In many cases, users may be required to enter their first and last name, age, zip code and e-mail address. In some cases, users will be required to select a special user name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password. If the Site determines that a person is under the age of thirteen, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998(15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.). Children who indicate that they are under thirteen years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on the Site that involve the collection and retention of personal information and they will not be contacted about special offers or promotions. The Site works with (and may provide links to) third party sites. Such third parties may permit children under the age of thirteen to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies. For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES AND YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE POLICY By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Policy. All modifications or updates will be posted on the Site. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email or some other means. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of such revised privacy policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not use our site. CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION If your personally identifiable information (such as your address) changes, or if you no longer desire to access our Site, you may correct, update or remove the personal data you have provided to us by making changes to your profile, by using an opt out message in an email, or by emailing the Site at webmaster@cstv.com with your request.

Security We are aware that customers may be concerned regarding the use of credit cards over the Internet. We want you to know that we have taken every possible precaution to ensure a secure shopping environment. We offer the ability to encrypt your transactions using state of the art technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), CyberCash, CyberCoin, and vPOS*. Our 1024-bit SSL certificate from Verisign enables the world's strongest SSL encryption, which protects confidential information from interception and hacking, with both domestic and export versions of Microsoft, Mozilla FireFox and Netscape browsers. Please click on the Verisign "Secure Site" seal for verification of our security certification. Our site is PCI compliant. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard was created by major credit card companies to safeguard customer information. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and other credit card associations mandate that merchants and service providers meet certain minimum standards of security when they store, process and transmit cardholder data. Our site uses ScanAlert, the largest web site security certification service to continuously monitor our site for potential security risks. ScanAlert's certification of PCI compliance meets the requirements of Visa's CISP and AIS, MasterCard's SDP, American Express' DSS, DiscoverCard and JCB. Our site is HACKERSAFE certified. By passing rigorous daily network security audits including Dynamic Port Scanning, Port-level Network Services Vulnerability Testing, and Web Application Vulnerability Testing, we provide highly effective, pro-active security. When you see the HACKERSAFE logo, it means the site meets all U.S. Government requirements for remote vulnerability testing as set forth by the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) who is accredited by the SANS Institute to meet the requirements of the SANS/FBI "Top Twenty Internet Securities Vulnerabilities" tests Customers should also know we do not store credit card or ordering information on our Internet servers. Pay any way you want from debit and credit cards to virtual wallets, knowing your financial privacy is protected by industrial-strength security. When you bring up any page that asks you to enter secure information, either a blue stripe will appear across the top of your browser window, the broken image of a key will become unbroken at the bottom of the browser window, or the open lock will close at the bottom of your browser window. This means that all information being transmitted will be encrypted first. If you are not using a browser that supports encryption, you can download Microsoft's Internet Explorer http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx , Mozilla's FireFox http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ or Netscape http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/ now. Keeping your credit card numbers a secret is actually easier on the Internet than at the mall, on the phone, and at the gas station. The most important thing to remember is that if your account number, but not the actual card, has been used by an unauthorized person, you are not liable for any amount. Once you've reported a problem with your card directly to your card issuer by phone, follow up in writing with your card issuer and keep copies of all correspondence. Even in the unlikely event your credit card number were to be stolen on-line, you are not responsible for the charges. Please note that in any case, the University is not and will not be held responsible for any breach of security or any fraudulent credit card use.
