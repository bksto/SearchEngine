Your gift to the Annual Fund will help ensure the quality of this extraordinary university by strengthening what it does so well and by creating new opportunities for achievement for our students and faculty." - Chancellor Henry T. Yang Every year, thousands of UC Santa Barbara alumni, parents, and friends express their support for the university through gifts to the Annual Fund. These unrestricted contributions are put to use immediately to help create special opportunities for students, develop new programs, and support the continuing evolution of the campus. We invite you to become a partner in creating a dynamic future for UC Santa Barbara by making a contribution to the UCSB Annual Fund.   The Annual Fund employs approximately 250 student callers who are responsible for reaching out to you and other friends of the campus and soliciting your support. They contact more than 40,000 alumni and parents annually. They report that talking to you is always a rewarding experience. And when you tell them that you want to make a gift to the Annual Fund, they practically jump for joy! Now you also can make a gift using our secure giving online Web site. Once you submit the completed form, you will receive an acknowledgement confirming your donation. Every gift, whether large or small, is truly appreciated. For your thoughtful consideration and support, UC Santa Barbara offers a sincere Thank You.
