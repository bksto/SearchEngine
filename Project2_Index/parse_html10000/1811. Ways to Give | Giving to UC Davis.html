More Ways to Give Cash gifts may also be made by money order or wire transfer. Pledges allow donors to promise a gift and make payments over time, which sometimes enables contributors to give more generously than otherwise possible. Payments can be made using cash, credit cards, securities, or other kinds of assets, over a period of up to five years. Planned gifts are giving arrangements that enable donors to support the university while benefiting from specific tax advantages and income streams. Gifts of securities, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds, can provide relief from capital gains taxes. Gifts-in-kind are items of tangible personal property or other physical assets — including artwork, books, equipment or specialized instruments — that are of value to the university. Gifts of real property, including land, farms, personal residences, and rental or commercial property, can benefit the university while providing relief from capital gains taxes and eliminating property expenses. Donate your car, boat, RV or motorcycle. Go the extra mile with your unused vehicle. If your automobile is no longer of use to you, it can still go a long way towards supporting our foundation.
