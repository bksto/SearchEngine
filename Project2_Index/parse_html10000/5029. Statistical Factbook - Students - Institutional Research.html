University Enrollment Student Demographics First-time Freshmen Profile Trends in Enrollment & FTES Trends in Enrollment & FTES (Palm Desert Campus) Trends in Enrollment by Ethnicity Enrollment by College Trends by Student Level Enrollment by Level and Academic Plan Demographics by Academic Plan Class Size by Discipline FTES by Discipline Degrees Awarded Graduate Degrees Undergraduate Degrees Degrees Awarded Since 1966 The version of the Factbook you are now reading reflects significant changes to statistical data reporting. Historically, a fulltime equivalent student (FTES) comprises 15 units per quarter (45 per year). The year 2006-07 brought a differentiation for students in Graduate programs for whom 12 units is now defined as one FTES. From Fall 2007 to Fall 2014, a doctoral student advanced to candidacy was defined as one FTES regardless of the number of units. Since Winter 2015, 12 units is defined as one FTES for all graduate students (master's and doctoral students). The CSU System has also begun differentiating between California Residents and Non-Residents so a Residency distinction has been included on several tables. Also, majors in this Factbook are now reported as Academic Plan (local), rather than the traditional CSU Hegis majors, to make the Factbook relevant to colleges. Finally, Fall 2009 reflects a new coding of ethnicity mandated by the Federal government. While some tables provide historical statistics based on the current coding rules, most tables will reflect the definitions in effect at those past times.
