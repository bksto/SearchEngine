The content, whether graphical or text heavy, dictates how best it is to be displayed. The absence of navigation has an impact in the user's navigation experience, yet, there is always new variations that result in new ways of presenting the information. The diverse configurations are caused by the local.css file residing in their relative directory. Default Layout The default layout configuration employs 2 columns and the navigation bar. The column widths are 370 and 175 pixels wide. Default Layout One Column With Nav This configuration uses only one column and and the navigation bar. One Column With Nav Two Columns With Nav This configuration is similar to the default except its 2 visible columns are of equal width. Two Columns With Nav "T" Setup With Nav This configuration divides the layout in 4 regions, one is the full width of the 2 columns and it has a navigation bar. "T" Setup With Nav One Column No Nav This configuration uses only one column and no navigation. One Column No Nav Two Columns No Nav This configuration uses 2 equal width columns without the navigation bar. Two Columns No Nav "T" Setup No Nav The "T" configuration divides the layout in 3 regions, one is the full width of the layout and the other 2 columns are of equal width. This setup does not have a navigation bar. "T" Setup No Nav Typically more prominent pages could benefit from displaying both, the audience and primary navigation bars at the top, below the header.
