If you're wondering how to Tweet with your location, please see our Adding your location to a Tweet article. What location information is attached to my Tweets? Enabling location services allows you to selectively add location information to your Tweets. This feature is off by default and you will need to opt in to use it. Once you've enabled location services, you will be able to attach a location (such as a city or neighborhood) of your choice to your Tweet. When you are using Twitter for Android or Twitter for iOS your Tweet will also include your precise location (latitude and longitude). What controls do I have when I attach location information to my Tweets? Even after you enable Tweeting with your location, you have additional control over which Tweets (and what type of location information) is shared. With this in mind: Tweet location is off by default, and as a user you need to opt in to the service. You can turn Tweet location on or off at any time. You can delete all of your past location data from displaying in your Tweets in a single place (see this article for step-by-step instructions). Be cautious and careful about the amount of information you share online. There may be some updates where you want to share your location ("The parade is starting now" or "A truck just spilled delicious candy all over the roadway!"), and some updates where you want to keep your location private. Just like you might not want to Tweet your home address, please be cautious when Tweeting from locations that you don't want others to see. Remember that when you're opted in to Tweet location, you can still choose not to share your location for individual Tweets (see this article for instructions). Please familiarize yourself with our general location settings and the settings of any applications and devices you Tweet with so that you are always aware of the information you share. Remember, once you post something online, it’s out there for others to see. What location information is displayed? All geolocation information begins as a location (latitude and longitude), sent from your browser or device. Twitter won't show any location information unless you've opted in to the feature, and have allowed your device or browser to transmit your coordinates to us. If you have chosen to attach location information to your Tweets, your selected location label is displayed underneath the text of the Tweet. On twitter.com, you can select a location label such as the name of a neighborhood or city. If you have attached a location to a Tweet using Twitter for iPhone or Twitter for Android, your Tweet will include both the location label of your choice and your device’s precise location (latitude and longitude). Your precise location may be more specific than the location label you select. Application developers are required to be up-front and obvious about whether your exact coordinates, or just the place, will be displayed. When you Tweet from a third-party application or mobile device, it should be clear which type of data will be publicly displayed. Having trouble?
