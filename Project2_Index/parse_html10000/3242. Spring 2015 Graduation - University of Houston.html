Apply between February 28–March 27 for a nonrefundable fee of $50 per degree. Summer 2015 Candidates In order to participate in the Spring Commencement and Convocation, Summer graduates must apply by April 17, 2015. ﻿Participation Fall 2014 graduates will receive information on complimentary tickets for themselves and their families, and will join the University Commencement in a special honorary section with their families. Spring 2015 candidates should apply for graduation by the regular deadline of February 27 (late deadline March 27) and be approved to graduate by their Colleges. Summer 2015 candidates must apply for Summer graduation by an early deadline of April 17 in order to be considered for participation in the May University Commencement (the Summer graduation application opens April 3). Applicants will be "pre-reviewed" by their College to determine whether all remaining coursework and requirements for graduation can reasonably be completed during the Summer semester. Note that this is a pre-review process for the purpose of approval to participate in the University Commencement only; formal graduation review will still occur in the final graduating semester. Students planning to graduate in the Summer and interested in participating in Spring Commencement are encouraged to contact their academic advisors to confirm they are on a path to Summer completion. A degree is conferred once final degree requirements are satisfied, rather than by participating in the Commencement ceremony. ﻿Regalia Order online from Herff Jones from February 17–March 21.
