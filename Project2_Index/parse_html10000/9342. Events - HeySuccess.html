Students gather at a predesignated location and take part in workshops, presentations, hang around, visit some locations in the neighborhood or participate in other interesting activities. In the Events, you can find three sub-categories: Conferences are a perfect opportunity to meet a vast number of young people from different countries (sometimes even continents). Some of the biggest student conferences, like One Young World, have deliberately set their agenda at having the participants from every single country if possible. Summer & Winter Schools: They last longer and are more focused than conferences. They intend to enhance the knowledge of the participants in one field, for example, art, natural sciences, and international politics. These sessions are an excellent opportunity to acquire additional knowledge or skills in one particular area, and meet likeminded people and quality contacts that can be very beneficial in the future career of the participant. Trainings: Everything said for the Summer & Winter Schools applies to Trainings as well, except that they last much longer. The second important difference is that they are a much rarer and more exclusive event. They are organized by various NGOs, corporations, and international organizations and, in most cases, they are a life-changing opportunity for its participants.
