The office provides advice on policies, programs and services to achieve Affirmative Action goals and enhance the culture of the campus community; including the prevention, reporting, investigation, and remedy of sexual misconduct (including discrimination, harassment, assault, and violence).

ASU is committed to the goal of equal opportunity for all. This policy is adopted by the Arkansas State University Board of Trustees. All personnel responsible for hiring employees and recruiting students share a responsibility to support the university's equal opportunity and affirmative action program and to provide leadership in achieving its goals.
