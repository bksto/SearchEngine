News and Announcements February 4, 2015 Free computer backup service for Stanford Earth graduate students Recognizing that backups of computer data files are an essential part of protecting Stanford's teaching and research, the School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences has purchased access to the central University IT cloud-based CrashPlan PROe backup service for the computers of all graduate students in the School. December 12, 2014 No IT support in Earth Sciences Dec 20, 2014 through Jan 4, 2015 The School of Earth Sciences will be observing the university winter closure from December 20, 2014 through January 4, 2015. In general, there will be no information technology services or support available in Earth Sciences during this period. October 10, 2014 Mitchell A59 G.R.I.D. lab closed for upgrades Nov. 12, 2014 - disks to be erased The Mitchell A59 G.R.I.D. computer lab is maintained for individual research and creation of presentations such as posters. The lab will be closed on November 12 to do a major upgrade of the operating systems and applications. The single computer "Saxton" will be removed from the lab on November 3. It will be used to build the new system image and then returned on November 12 to be upgraded with the other computers. All user files created on the local computer disks will be erased! August 15, 2014 University computer enrollment process starts August 26, 2014 A brief "enrollment" questionnaire to collect basic information about computers and their users will be pushed out to managed computers in Earth Sciences as a "pop-up" application starting on August 26. Please take a few minutes to fill out this questionnaire. The results will be used to determine which computers need additional security improvements. January 24, 2014 School of Earth Sciences plans for computing security compliance Dean Matson sent this letter to the Stanford Earth Sciences community outlining our plans for compliance with new university computing security requirements. January 23, 2014 Upgrade Windows XP before April 8 or lose access to Stanford network! All computers on the SES network that still use Windows XP must upgrade to a supported version of Windows 7 or Windows 8 by April 8, 2014, or be replaced or retired. The upgrade, backup, and encryption of Stanford-owned Windows XP computers will be done by our IT team. If you have an XP machine, you will be contacted by our IT staff to schedule an upgrade. Students who have personal computers running XP also need to upgrade. Technical measures will block network access for computers running Windows XP after April 8. January 23, 2014 Requirements for purchasing new computers for Stanford work To comply with new university security requirements, effective immediately, only approved computer configurations may be purchased with Stanford funds and they must be configured and encrypted by our CRC support team before use.
