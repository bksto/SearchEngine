Students gain hands-on experience through the completion of an aerospace-related Major Qualifying Project (MQP) and lab work. Aerospace Engineering also encourages each student’s creative talents, with the goal of developing a personal high standard of excellence and professionalism. The program seeks to instill an appreciation of the role of aerospace engineers in society.
