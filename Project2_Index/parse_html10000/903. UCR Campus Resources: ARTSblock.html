UCR/California Museum of Photography UCR/California Museum of Photography contains one of America's major photographic collections, including the world's largest sterograph archive – the Keystone-Mast Collection,  Ansel Adams’ Fiat Lux archive and the most extensive collection of cameras in the West. Behind the Art Deco façade from the 1920s lies a unique museum space created by California post-modernist architect Stanley Saitowitz containing three floors of galleries plus a walk-in camera obscura, an auditorium for frequent public programs, and an Archive Study Room where work from the collection can be viewed. The Permanent Collection Gallery surveys the history of photography, while four exhibition galleries present changing exhibitions. UCR/CMP also initiates major photographic exhibitions that travel to venues around the world. Barbara and Art Culver Center of the Arts Opened in October 2010, The Barbara and Art Culver Center of the Arts is a presentation and research facility housed in the renovated Rouse Building, a magnificent 1895 department store. The Culver Center extends the vitality and community interactivity of UCR/California Museum of Photography and Sweeney Art Gallery. It houses a new home for the Sweeney Gallery; a 72 seat state-of-the-art film and video room; an atrium gallery for installation, music and performance under a magnificent 35 foot skylight; a public café; and a new seismically protected home for the UCR/CMP's world-treasured Keystone-Mast glass plate stereo collection. Culver's second floor contains an advanced faculty, student and community laboratory for advanced research in the arts. Sweeney Art Gallery Established in 1963, the Sweeney Art Gallery relocated to downtown Riverside in 2006 and in 2010, reopened in the Barbara and Art Culver Center of the Arts. It serves as an artistic laboratory that engages diverse audiences with exhibitions and programs committed to experimentation, innovation, and the exploration of art in our time. Featuring five exhibitions per year, including showcasing UCR Art Department undergraduate and graduate student work, Sweeney places a special emphasis on inspiring projects that explore new ideas and materials, re-envision the relationship between art and life, and contribute to the artistic spirit of the campus and the community. At the center of the gallery's mission is an appreciate for the role artists play in the intellectual and cultural life of society.
