The museum collections of site-specific outdoor sculpture, works of art on paper, and the Gordon Hampton Collection of American painting and prints, feature examples of the work of the most important contemporary masters. Presented as major exhibitions, offered for examination by students and scholars, and circulated to national institutions, the UAM collections are a permanent, regional visual resource and archive of contemporary culture. Explore the collections online via the UAM Collections Kiosk, where you can search for artists, browse different media and even make your own community portfolio of your favorite pieces from the collection. Site-Specific Outdoor Sculpture Collection The site-specific outdoor sculpture collection was begun in 1965 with the International Sculpture Symposium, the first to be held on a university campus in the United States. Supported by innovative partnerships with local industry, the international roster of invited artists generated nine major monumental works sited across the 322 acre CSULB campus. Since 1965, the collection has grown from nine to twenty-one works. The Gordon F. Hampton Collection of art features 89 works by 43 artists, including signature works by such artists as Al Held, Michael Goldberg, Adolph Gottlieb, Lee Krasner, and Milton Resnick. Gordon F. Hampton (1912-1996) was a renowned Los Angeles antitrust attorney, an enlightened art patron, philanthropist, and one of the original partners in the law firm of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, LLP. Hampton fostered his expansive interest in art as he traveled the world assembling a notable and distinctly personal collection. The late attorney's collection—the property of the Gordon F. Hampton Foundation—was given to the UAM through the generosity of his children, Wesley G. Hampton, Roger K. Hampton and Katharine (Kit) Hampton Shenk. Tours of the Hampton collection can be arranged through the Education office. Please contact Curator of Education Brian Trimble for more information. Explore the Gordon F. Hampton Collection online through the UAM Collections Kiosk, where you can search for artists, browse different media, and even make your own community portfolio of your favorite pieces from the collection. UAM Works on Paper Collection In 1979 the UAM began to regularly acquire works on paper with modest acquisition funds augmented by university allocations, grants, and private donations. These works are a documentary record of the university's arts involvement, and a source of delight to community members and K-12 students and teachers, enabling them to frequently examine "old friends" and to develop, in particular, a better understanding of the art of our time. © 2014 University Art Museum | CSULB STAY CONNECTED!
