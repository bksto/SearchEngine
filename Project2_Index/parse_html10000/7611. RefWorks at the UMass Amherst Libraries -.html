Comments (0)   TIP: Save PDFs in RefWorks Make RefWorks your professional library! Attach the PDF of each article to its RefWorks record in your account, and create your own professional library! Add the article's citation to your Refworks account Download and save PDF of article Edit the RefWorks record (Top right, 2nd icon - looks like paper and pencil) Upload PDF (using "Attachments - Browse" - you may have to scroll down to see this) Save record Comments (0)   How to - Overview Use RefWorks to create a document with the proper format, but to use it efficiently, you must do some manipulation.  Use APA, MLA, or USGS Annotated with Abstracts. When you download the record from a database it automatically loads the abstract of the article in the Abstracts field in RefWorks.  These formats will output whatever they find in the Abstracts field as the "annotation," so edit the Abstract field in the RefWorks record to replace the abstract with your own annotation. Overview of the process 1. Collect citations in your personal RefWorks account as you encounter them; put the ones for your bibliography in one folder 2. As you read an article, take notes to capture your thoughts 3. Edit its RefWorks record to add your annotations (or write them there in the first place) Move (cut and paste) the article's Abstract into another text field in its RefWorks record to preserve it Write your annotations in the RefWorks Abstract field 4. Produce a formatted annotated bibliography using an Annotated with Abstracts "output style" Step-by-step directions for How to Create an Annotated Bibliography in RefWorks. (Thanks to Isabel Espinal for updating this PDF!) NOTE: Only these few output styles have a pre-packaged "Annotated with Abstracts" option: APA, 5th and 6th editions MLA, 5th, 6th, and 7th editions USGS But you can customize any output style to include annotations.  See RefWorks help for How the Output Style Editor Works, or ask for help from me. Comments (0)   Alternate method - cut & paste in your document Use the Annotated with Abstracts document output to create the format structure, then just replace the abstracts with your annotations. Keep the citations you wish to use in one folder. Write and save annotations for your citations using a word processor In RefWorks, use that folder and a format for Annotated with Abstracts to create a document with the proper structure for your annotated bibliography. Replace the abstracts in the document with your annotations. The point of this is to use RefWorks for formatting. For example, APA style requires that your annoations be double-spaced; the format should be retained if you just replace the abstracts in your document with your own annotations. This method doesn't require you to put your annotations in RefWorks, but it does require that you keep them somewhere as you are reading the articles.

Comments (0)   RefWorks Help Need help with RefWorks: Schedule an appointment with a RefWorks Librarian Comments (0)   FAQ Frequently Asked Questions What is RefWorks? RefWorks is a web-based tool that assists in managing citations, creating bibliographies, and importing references from online databases. How do I access RefWorks from on campus? Go to the library's homepage www.library.umass.edu. Click RefWorks from the Research Tools section on the left. Click on Sign up for a New Account and create a login and password. RefWorks will then email you the username and password you created. What is the Group Code?  If you are prompted for the group code, type in RWUMassA (not case sensitive). How do I access RefWorks from off campus? Go to www.refworks.com and click on Login. If you are prompted for the group code, type in RWUMassA. You will be asked to authenticate with your OIT username and password. After you authenticate, you will get the RefWorks login screen as in #2 above. How do I import citations from library databases or the Library Catalog into RefWorks? Some databases allow you to export your selected citations directly into your RefWorks account. Otherwise, you can save your search results as text file on any of your local drives. Then in RefWorks, select Import under the References menu; then select University of Massachusetts as the import filter along with the database you searched, and import the file. For detailed information about importing from different databases, see Database Import Instructions and/or "Import Overview" from the RefWorks site. What if the database I need to use is not included in the RefWorks filters? Refworks contains filters for many databases and information vendors. However, if you do not find a filter for a particular database, you may request that RefWorks create one for your database. While logged into your RefWorks account, click on "Request Filter/Format" in the Import screen. Keep in mind that it may not always be possible to create a filter for a particular database. This decision is usually that of the database vendor and not RefWorks. When I try to export citations from a database to RefWorks, nothing happens. What do I do? See if the popup window blocker is set on your browser. In Firefox; click the Firefox tab at the top and then Options  and then Content to check if the Popup Blocker is enabled. If it is, you need to add RefWorks as an allowed site.  On this screen, to add RefWorks; click Exceptions and add www.refworks.com as an allowed site. In Internet Explorer, click the gear on the Upper right side of the screen and choose Internet Options.   Click the Privacy Tab at the top of the page, and look to see if the popup blocker is enabled.  If so you need to add RefWorks as an allowed site.  To do this, click settings, and add www.refworks.com to the allowed list of Websites. If you've added the Google toolbar to Internet Explorer, the popup blocker may be set. Select Options. Go to Accessories - Options and turn off the Popup Blocker. If you continue to have problems with exporting citations to RefWorks, you may want to save your citations as text and use RefWorks to import. See #6. How can I export my bibliographic information? You may export all or some of your bibliographic information into another bibliographic management program such as EndNote (see question 14, below, for details), a comma-delimited file, or as a text or Word file (e.g. a formatted bibliography or citation list). You may also export your citations in RefWorks format, in order to share them with another RefWorks user who can then import the citations into their RefWorks account. Where are my RefWorks bibliographies stored? Your bibliographic information is stored on the RefWorks server. Is there a limit to the size of my database? No. Your database may contain an unlimited number of references. Is there a limit to the data I can put in the notes and abstract fields? The notes, abstract, and user definable fields are limited to 1 gigabyte of information. Note that by adding large amounts of data to these fields, the program takes more time to display each reference. My data doesn't always import correctly. What can I do? Make sure the data you are trying to import is in a tagged format. For example: TI: Title Reforming the circle: fragments of the social history of a vernacular African dance form. AU: Author James, Wendy AF: AuthorAffiliation Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology, University of Oxford SO: Source Journal of African Cultural Studies; Jun2000, Vol. 13 Issue 1, p140, 13p Go to the Import area of RefWorks and ensure that both the Import Filter/Data Source and Database have been selected correctly. If you don't see either All Databases or the specific database you are searching in the drop down list, we do not have a filter for that particular database. In this case the data may still import but it may not be imported into the correct fields and the source information will all go into the notes field. Selecting Multiple Databases will not work if the specific database you are importing is not in the list. If you selected the correct Data Source and Database but the data still comes in incorrectly, please contact the RefWorks support department at support@refworks.com. Attach a sample of the text file you are importing along with information on the source of the data. Why does my bibliography have incorrect data included in the output document? The output format takes the data from a particular field and inserts it into the bibliography. If the data in the field is incorrect it will appear to be wrong in the output format. For instance, you may see a book title that has [Monograph] after it. Journal titles may also show an extra tag regarding volume numbers. The problem may be with the way the data is imported rather than with the output format. Always check that the data in the database is correct before formatting a bibliography. If it is incorrect, you may edit the data yourself. How do I import citations from EndNote, ProCite, or Reference Manager? To import records into RefWorks from other citation software, see Converting Records from Other Bibliographic Management Programs. How do I export my RefWorks citations to EndNote? From RefWorks, go to the References menu and select Export. Choose the Bibliographic Software option and save the file to your computer In EndNote, go to the File menu and select Import. Locate the file and for "import option" choose "Reference Manager RIS." Is RefWorks compatible with Latex/BibTeX? Yes. RefWorks has a BibTex output format. After you've input your citations into RefWorks, select the Bibliography button and select BibTeX as the output format. Select Base Bibliography on Reference List and select RTF as the File Type to Create. Select Create Bibliography. You can then select all references or references from a particular folder. A separate RTF with your citations in BibTeX format will be created. What is Write-and-Cite? Write-N-Cite allows Microsoft Word users to run an abbreviated version of RefWorks in a paper or manuscript. It also automatically formats references in the paper and bibliographies. To learn more about Write-N-Cite, tutorials about how to download and its use are available from RefWorks Can I open two accounts in RefWorks at the same time? Yes. Open your browser a second time by selecting it from the Program menu or by clicking on the icon on your desktop or task bar. [Do not open another window by selecting File, New, Window --this will only re-open the first RefWorks account.] Can a RefWorks account be shared by a group? Yes. An individual may create more than one account using the same email address, but with different usernames and passwords for each account. This can be useful when working on group projects. The username and password can be shared with other members of the group for one of the accounts. Each member can then log in to that RefWorks account to add, organize, or delete information. During the process, each group member can utilize the bibliographic resources from the group folder and then use RefWorks to format the bibliography according to the preferred style. How do I back up my citations? Select the Backup/Restore link under the References menu. Select Include References (for the database) and/or Include Output Styles (for outputs). Click on Perform Backup. Save the file when prompted. It should be saved as a .zip file. Please do not change the extension of the file as it is necessary to restore if you need to do so later. Although RefWorks backs up all databases on a regular basis, we recommend users do this as well. You may also export your references to a text file as a back up measure by choosing Export under the References menu. Click to see a video about how to backup citations. I want to write my paper off line. How do I print out a list of references with RefIDs? Create a folder and add all of the references you'll need for the paper. Next, Click on Export and select the folder to be printed. Select Citation List (which includes the refID, author, title, and year). Click Export to Text File. Once the file displays, use the browser's Print function to print the paper. What happens when I graduate or leave UMass for another institution with RefWorks access? If your new institution has a RefWorks subscription, just contact RefWorks and they will transfer your data.  You may also want to do this yourself: The first way is to create a backup of one account, and restore the file in the other account. However, this is only suggested when one account has just been created or has no valuable references in the account.  For populated accounts, export references in a RefWorks Tagged Format and save the text file that is presented. Then log in to the other account and import that text file using the RefWorks Tagged Format Import Filter. You will need to export the references from each account that you no longer want/need.  Once all of the references have been imported from the other accounts, go back through your document and update your citations. When the references are imported in to the account, the reference ID's will change. Those will need to be updated. What happens when I graduate UMass but still want access to my RefWorks account? Simply update your user information (aka Profile in 2.0) by changing the User Type to Alumni. Update the email address with your new alumni email address or a personal address. You will be prompted for the Group Code: RWUMASSA I am a graduate of UMass but never used RefWorks. How do I set up a RefWorks account for the first time? (a) Register with Maroon Central to obtain a 10-digit alumni ID. You can also contact the Alumni Association at 1-800-456-8627 or alumni@admin.umass.edu. (b) Apply online for an alumni e-mail (forwarding) account; you will be asked for your alumni ID.   (c) Once you've established an alumni e-mail address, send a message to refworks@library.umass.edu and ask for the Group Code to access your RefWorks account.

How do I transfer my RefWorks data from the previous school I attended? Once you sign up for an individual account at UMass, contact RefWorks to transfer your data for you. You may also want to do this yourself: The first way, is to create a backup of one account, and restore the file in the other account. However, this is only suggested when one account has just been created or has no valuable references in the account.  For populated accounts, export references in a RefWorks Tagged Format and save the text file that is presented. Then log in to the other account and import that text file using the RefWorks Tagged Format Import Filter. You will need to export the references from each account that you no longer want/need.  Once all of the references have been imported from the other accounts, go back through your document and update your citations. When the references are imported in to the account, the reference ID's will change. Those will need to be updated. What is RefGrab-It?
