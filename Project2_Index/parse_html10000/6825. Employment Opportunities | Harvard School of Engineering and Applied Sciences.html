Home About SEAS Employment Opportunities Employment Opportunities Dean of Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Faculty, Researcher, and Lecturer Positions Postdoctoral & Fellowship Positions Staff Positions The engineering and applied sciences community at Harvard is special. We have little hierarchy and a high level of autonomy; we have no formal departments but countless informal groups linked by similar interests. On any given day, someone here is likely to cross paths or collaborate with a half-dozen people or more. We are committed to supporting and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds, countries, and cultures. Doing so gives us the ability to readily adapt, the creativity to come up with fresh ideas, the openness to connect with others, and the willingness to share knowledge and our excitement about pursuing it. Current and prospective employees should explore our Faculty and Staff site. Our employees enjoy all the benefits of Harvard employment. Recruit SEAS students for Jobs and Internships Companies and other organizations interested in posting job and internship opportunities geared towards Harvard undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and applied sciences should work with the Harvard Office of Career Services (OCS).
