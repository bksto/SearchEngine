How Do I Check on the Status of My Application?   Financial Aid Application Checklist Step 1: File a 2015-2016 Free Application for Federal Student Aid Step 2: You will receive various notifications Step 3: You are awarded financial aid Step 4: Accept or decline your financial aid award Step 5: Complete additional online requirements for your student loan Step 6: Your check will be mailed to you Step 1: File a 2015-2016 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Important Tips Submit only one application. To electronically apply and sign your FAFSA, students and parents should apply for a Personal Identification Number (PIN) at www.pin.ed.gov. If you already have a Federal Student Aid PIN, but have lost or forgotten it, you can request a duplicate on the PIN website. To reduce possible mistakes and streamline the financial aid application process, students and parents may be eligible to use the Internal Revenue Service Data Retrieval process. This means when you fill out your FAFSA you may be eligible to automatically transfer your federal tax information directly from the IRS into your FAFSA! To use this feature, we strongly encourage you and your parents to file your federal tax returns as early as possible before completing the FAFSA. Enter CSUDH's institutional code 001141 in the Federal School Code field and CSUDH will receive your results electronically. Review the application carefully to make sure all answers are completed and are accurate. If you or our parents have questions or are unsure on how to complete the application, call our office at (310) 243-3691. By providing complete responses, the analysis of your financial circumstances will be thorough and will provide us with the ability to be sensitive to your individual needs. Do Not Email Forms to Our Office. We do not recommend emailing forms to our office for three reasons: 1) Often we don’t receive attachments or they cannot be opened; 2) Emailed forms take longer to process; 3)You will expose your personal information to interception by hackers. If you are a new CSUDH student, do not wait until you are admitted to the University to apply for financial aid. The earlier you apply, the better chance you have that funds will be available. Back to top Step 2: You will receive various notifications Notification from CSUDH's Financial Aid Office: Once we have received your FAFSA information, you will receive an acknowledgement letter from our office. Notification from the Federal Processor: Once you have submitted your FAFSA, you will receive an email notification that will contain a link to your Student Aid Report (SAR). Your SAR can't be used to make corrections to your FAFSA. You'll need to make corrections on your SAR online using your PIN at the FAFSA website or request a paper SAR. If you submitted your FAFSA online without an e-mail address, you'll receive a paper SAR Acknowledgement. This SAR Acknowledgement will have all of the information you provided on the FAFSA. Cal Grant Notification from the California Student Aid Commission: If you are selected to receive a Cal Grant, you will be sent a "California Aid Report" (CAR) by the California Student Aid Commission. Students must follow the printed instructions on the CAR. Verification Notification: You may be randomly selected by the Federal Government for a verification process. In this event, we will send you a notification. Click here for more information. Back to top Step 3: You are awarded financial aid If you are eligible, you will be awarded financial aid. You will receive a letter from our office as well as an email notification of your financial aid award and amount. Or, you also may check your financial aid award status online at My.CSUDH.EDU. Back to top Step 4: Accept or decline your financial aid award If you are awarded financial aid, you must accept or decline financial aid online at My.CSUDH.EDU. Be sure to read our Financial Aid Award Guide [Get Adobe Acrobat Reader Free here.], which contains pertinent information about the offer as well as explains your rights and responsibilities as a financial aid recipient. Financial aid is intended to be used to pay educational expenses. You will have 15 days to accept/decline your awards. Failure to respond will result in cancellation of your awards. Back to top Step 5: Complete additional online requirements for your student loan If you are offered a student loan, you must complete additional requirements to receive the loan. You are required to: Complete an online entrance interview at StudentLoans.gov Complete an online master promissory note committing student to repay the loan. Complete the promissory note online at StudentLoans.gov Back to top Step 6: Your refund will be mailed to you. Prior to the first day of the semester, financial aid refunds (minus registration and housing fees) are processed by Student Financial Services for students who have completed steps 1-5 above. Students have the option of selecting to receive their refund either by Direct Deposit or receiving a check.  Information on setting up Direct Deposit can be found here. Back to top Top 5 Common Mistakes to Avoid Listing the incorrect Social Security Number or driver's license number: Triple check the numbers and have someone else check for accuracy too. Listing adjusted gross income as equal to taxes paid: Adjusted gross income will be a larger amount than taxes paid. Listing parent or student's marital status incorrectly: Provide the marital status of the parent with whom the student resides. If the parent is remarried, provide the step-parent's information as well. Leaving the question about drug-related offenses blank: If the student is unsure about this answer, check before submitting the FAFSA. A conviction doesn't always disqualify students from receiving aid. Do not leave this field blank! Missing parent's and/or student's signature: When filing the FAFSA electronically, be sure to get a PIN for the student and the parent from www.pin.ed.gov. This will serve as the student's and parent's electronic signature. Back to top Am I Eligible?
