Every decision maker, from the owner of a small start-up to the CEO of a global conglomerate, works with accounting information. This is a far stretch from the stereotype of back-room number crunching. Economics Economic problems center around the utilization of limited resources to provide goods and services for society. As a social science, economics is concerned with people in their roles as economic decision makers. Economists study how business and personal decisions are made under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information, and they provide insight into problems involving both short- and long-term planning, such as investment and savings decisions. A strong grounding in both theoretical and applied aspects of economics allows students to use their knowledge to understand economic behavior and provides a basis for evaluating economic policy. Entrepreneurship, Technology & Law The Department of Entrepreneurship, Technology, and Law curricula provide students with the educational experiences of reasoning, problem solving, and decision making so that they, through balanced programs, will be qualified to accept responsible positions in business and the public sector. Finance & Quantitative Methods The Department of Finance and Quantitative Methods offers high quality programs for the development and communication of knowledge in studies related to finance, actuarial science, decision analysis, and quantitative methods and features an international faculty dedicated to teaching, innovative research, and service. Management and Leadership The Department of Management and Leadership offers programs in management, or the “art of getting things done through people,” as we define it. No matter the industry, managers are tasked with strategic and operational planning, organizing work, monitoring results, and engaging people in the entire process. Our programs provide the perspectives, knowledge, and skills needed to do so. Specifically, we take a practical approach to management education, embedding problem-solving, decision-making, and interpersonal skills through applied activities, case studies, and real-world experiences. Marketing We are proud of our people, our programs, and our product – graduates who are ready to hit the ground running in their careers. Our programs include Marketing and International Business and feature an approach to education that differentiates our graduates. © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
