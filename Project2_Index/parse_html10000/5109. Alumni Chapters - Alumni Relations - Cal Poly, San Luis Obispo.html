It’s easy to say yes. The Cal Poly Alumni regional and special interest chapters are scattered across the state of California and the nation. These chapters are volunteering in their communities, providing unique programming that shares the great things happening at Cal Poly, and helping to recruit the best and the brightest for the next generation of Cal Poly students. The boards of these chapters are always looking for new members and volunteers as they host annual meetings, golf tournaments, and other special activities in their local communities. If we don’t have a contact in your area and you would like to assist with an event or share your ideas with us, call the Alumni Association at (888) CAL-POLY or (805) 756-2586 or email alumni@calpoly.edu. Find your Regional Chapter Regional chapters are your very own Cal Poly “away from home.” Regional chapters offer year-round programming and events for all alumni in that area. Cal Poly has over 107,000 alumni living in California alone. For that reason, CPAA has grouped the chapters in California into four regions, Northern, Central Valley, Central Coast, and Southern. Discover an Affinity Chapter Special Interest Chapters are formed based on a unique interest for that group. They hold programs and events to connect their members and also support their student counterparts at Cal Poly.
