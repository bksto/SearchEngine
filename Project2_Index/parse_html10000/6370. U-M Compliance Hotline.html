University of Michigan Compliance Hotline For reporting financial, regulatory, NCAA, and patient safety issues Home The reporting process Other ways to make a report FAQ Compliance Resource Center Because compliance is everyone's responsibility Call 1-866-990-0111 to speak to a specialist or Click here to submit a report online The University of Michigan Compliance Hotline is a tool for U-M employees, students, vendors and others to raise concerns regarding financial, regulatory, NCAA, and patient safety issues. U-M is committed to providing an environment where individuals feel comfortable discussing compliance problems—no matter how big or small—and where people can safely and confidentially come forward to identify instances of fraud or other serious concerns. Callers to the U-M Compliance Hotline can remain anonymous. Customary resolution methods, such as talking to your supervisor, are still important first-line approaches for reporting compliance concerns. The Compliance Hotline is available for situations where conventional channels are uncomfortable or otherwise inappropriate, or for times when you wish to remain anonymous. You should keep in mind, however, that certain types of reports may be difficult for the university to pursue if you choose to remain anonymous. The Hotline does not replace existing reporting mechanisms across U-M's campuses or in the Health System, but rather serves as an additional option. For an overview of other reporting mechanisms, see other ways to make a report.       The Compliance Hotline is not for reporting criminal or medical emergencies. For emergency assistance, please call 911. Trained interview specialists Available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week Multi-lingual staff Compliance Resources Visit the Compliance Resource Center at compliance.umich.edu for more information and tools about compliance.
