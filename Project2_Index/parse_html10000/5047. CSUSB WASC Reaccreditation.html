WASC Reaccreditation 2013-2014 CSUSB WASC Reaccreditation California State University, San Bernardino is currently involved in the extensive self-evaluation process for reaccreditation through the Western Association of Schools and Colleges or WASC. The accreditation process is a thorough step-by-step look at all aspects of the university to demonstrate that Cal State San Bernardino graduates are achieving WASC core competencies in written and oral communication, critical thinking, information literacy, and quantitative reasoning. Following the completion of self-study essays and a virtual visit from the WASC review team in 2013, the process will culminate in fall 2014, when CSUSB hosts the WASC team for a campus visit. Cal State San Bernardino was most recently reaccredited by WASC in 2004, when the university received the maximum 10-year reaccreditation. Dr. Rong Chen, CSUSB associate provost for academic and international programs, chairs the university WASC steering committee and can be reached at (909) 537-5024 or rchen@csusb.edu.
