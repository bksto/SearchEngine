Students with vastly different credentials come from thousands of schools across the country and around the world. What unifies Harvard students are the talents they bring to the University and the passion to explore its vast resources. Admissions Facts In 2013, letters and email notifications of admission were sent to 2,029 students, 5.8 percent of the applicant pool of 35,023.  More than 82 percent of undergraduates admitted to the class of 2017 enrolled.  Visit the Harvard College Admissions site to learn more about the College admissions process. To learn more about admissions at the graduate and professional Schools, please go here.  Harvard College is committed to making educational opportunity accessible. The College’s admissions process is need blind; applying for financial aid does not diminish a student’s chances of admission. Financial Aid Facts In the 2013-14 academic year, Harvard College granted a record $182 million in financial aid to undergraduates.  Nearly 60 percent of Harvard students receive need-based aid to attend, and on average their families pay only $12,000 annually.  Approximately 20 percent of families pay nothing, and many College students graduate without debt.  Harvard's financial aid policy includes the following: Harvard College has a policy of “zero contribution” from families with normal assets earning $65,000 or less annually. Families with typical assets and incomes up to $150,000 will pay from zero to 10 percent of their income, depending on individual family circumstances. Students are asked to contribute to the cost of their education through term-time and summer work.  Harvard’s net price calculator enables prospective students and families to estimate the net cost of a year at Harvard and thus gain an understanding of the University's need-based financial aid program.
