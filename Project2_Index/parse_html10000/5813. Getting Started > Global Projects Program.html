Getting Started  WPI Project Centers offer projects focused on a wide range of topics - from environmental sustainability to historic preservation. Think about your own interests and the kind of project you'd like to participate in first, and then consider project center locations. The GPP application process is competitive. Meeting deadlines, completing all components of the application, and attending meeting and/or interviews on time all contribute to a successful application. Every application is carefully reviewed and considered. However, no student is guaranteed placement at any project center.  Start by browsing our programs to explore the regions of the world where our Project Centers are located.  Be sure to read all of the details of the program to determine what projects can be completed at the Project Center and, in come cases, what majors are eligible to apply. Once you have chosen a program, click on "Apply Now" on the program details page.  WPI students should select "I have a username and password" to prompt the WPI login screen.  You should login with your WPI credentials.  Most applications require some biographical information, a resume, and an essay.  Once you have started an application you may return to it to complete all requirements before submitting. IQP students: please note that you should only apply for your first choice program.  You will have a chance to rank your other Project Center preferences later in the application process. Contact the IGSD if you have any questions and good luck! Follow us on
