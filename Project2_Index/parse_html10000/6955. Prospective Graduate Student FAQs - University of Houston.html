The Bachelorss degree must be awarded by an accredited educational institution. Level 1 Professional Program applicants are highly encouraged, but not required, to take courses in Physics, Calculus and Creative Arts to help enhance visual creativity when putting their portfolios together. ﻿Is the program accredited? The Master of Architecture Level I & II Professional Programs are accredited through the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). The three advanced study programs are not accredited. ﻿Can I apply as a transfer student? Students wishing to transfer into the Graduate Program from another institution should follow the same application steps as a “regular” applicant. If admitted, the Graduate Director will evaluate the applicant's transcripts and course descriptions to determine if content can be waived. Please visit the Domestic Graduate Admission page for more information. ﻿Test Scores Do you have a minimum acceptable GRE score requirement? There is no minimum GRE score requirement for admission. Test scores are evaluated and taken into consideration, along with all other required application materials. Admission offers are based on the merit of all application materials. ﻿Cost of Attendance How much does the Graduate Program cost? Tuition and fees vary from year to year. Students are charged according to the number of hours enrolled during a semester along with applicable college fees, additional course fees, and student fees. For updated figures, please consult the University’s tuition and fee guide. Does the Graduate Program offer scholarships? All students are considered for merit-based scholarships as a part of the admissions review process. No additional application materials are necessary. The College of Architecture also has an annual scholarship application. All students, regardless of their admission classification (i.e. domestic or international students) are encouraged to apply for available scholarships that are administered through the College of Architecture. The application is sent out via e-mail each year. Does the Graduate Program offer instructional assistantships? This type of financial aid is offered through the College of Architecture on a limited basis. Students new to the College of Architecture are advised to apply for these assistantships after they have completed their first semester or year in the program. Typically, students must have shown a proficiency in English as well as comprehension of the subject matter for the course they intend to assist before they are assigned a course. Could I be considered for need-based financial aid? U.S. Citizens and permanent residents can seek need-based aid through the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. This type of assistance requires completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). ﻿Application Decisions Are applicants allowed entry on a conditional admission? The College of Architecture does not offer conditional admission. No guarantees of admission are made before or at the time of application. When will I find out if I'm accepted? All applicants will be notified via e-mail. The Admissions Committee reviews all applicants' completed files depending on how soon the application materials are received. Is it possible to defer? The College of Architecture does not permit deferrals. Students who cannot attend in the semester admitted must re-apply. Why was I denied acceptance? Applying to any school is similar to applying for a job. Depending on the applicant pool for an admissions cycle, some applicants will not be selected. Applicants are encouraged to submit applications, portfolios and additional materials as early as possible. Items not received in a timely manner will also delay the decision making process. What do I need to submit to reapply? You will need to repeat the application process with the exception of test scores. TOEFL scores are valid for 2 years after the test date; GRE scores are also valid for 2 years.
