Allison Wong put in a 3 point bucket to send the game to overtime (I recall her doing the same thing a couple years ago!) and Colleen Goeser put in a critical free throw in the 2nd OT that kept Redlands ahead with some excellent support by the defense. The men's game followed delayed a bit, but the action was just as intense. Both the Bulldogs and Stags traded buckets to a halftime tie, but Redlands put on their scoring game and pulled away in the second half for another win keeping them atop the SCIAC leader board. It was fun seeing all the kids practice their shooting skills on the court during halftime too. Great Job DAWGS (and future DAWGS)!!! Posted by Univ. of Redlands C.H.

I first watched the Lady Bulldogs defeat the Lady Poets of Whittier (67-56) with unstoppable scoring by Claire Stach! Then I hung around to see the men do the same thing even though it was practically tied at half time. The Bulldogs poured it on with multiple 3's in the second period to put the Poets away. Half time is my favorite part of basketball and I got to play with Coach Mari tonight. We love to keep the crowds entertained (and she gives me great snacks!) Next home games are next Saturday - It's bring a kid night too!! Come out and cheer on the DAWGS and see some exciting basketball. Go Redlands!!! Posted by Univ. of Redlands C.H.

What a great way to start off the new year with a tri-meet at Thompson Aquatic Center. The Bulldogs hosted CLU and Chapman in a well-contested meet.
