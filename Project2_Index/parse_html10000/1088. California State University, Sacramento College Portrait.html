Need Money Classrooms Fun Getting In What to Study Live Here Eat & Shop For Parents Find Help Living in the Sacramento State Community The Sacramento State Community Did you know that most American college students spend between 12 and 15 hours each week in the classroom? Even after you finish studying for class, there still will be plenty of time for other things. At Sacramento State, we hope that you’ll spend some of it getting involved in the student clubs, cultural organizations, intramural teams, leadership experiences, recreational trips or community service projects we offer. In addition, our campus recently opened a new recreation and wellness center (the WELL) with state-of-the-art fitness equipment, a climbing wall, a huge gym, health and counseling services, and much more. We also hope that you take advantage of the academic and student support systems we provide such as tutoring, the Writing Center, the Academic Advising Center, and the Financial Aid Office. If you need to find a job, visit the Career Center on campus. Staff can help you identify the type of on- or off-campus job that gives you the flexibility you need to take classes and keep your studies your top priority. And if you are coming to Sac State as a new student, we strongly recommend that you check out the residence halls and the new American River Courtyard suites. Living on campus is convenient, safe, affordable, and fun. Chances are good that you will make life-long friends with other students living in your building. Studies should always come first, but the more you get connected, join a group, and hang out on campus, the more you’ll feel a part of it all.
