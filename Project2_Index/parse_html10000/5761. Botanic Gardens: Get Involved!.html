You might also consider investing in the future of the Gardens by remembering it in your will. Bequests may be for an unrestricted or a specific purpose. Such gifts or bequests qualify as charitable contributions, and as such are deductible as prescribed by Federal and State tax laws.  For further information, please call Ms. Jo Ann Anderson, Senior Director of Development, College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, at (951) 827-3067.

Volunteering The Gardens relies on Volunteers in most areas of its operations and activities. Volunteers are the backbone of all events and keep the Gardens running smoothly on a day to day basis. The gardens needs your help to do all of this! Volunteering is a good way to help the Gardens and yourself as well - it is a learning experience and gives you the satisfaction of supporting a good cause. There are many areas of volunteer opportunities. The hours are very flexible - Volunteers can work from Monday to Thursday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Once you know your area and duties, you can come in at other times. Help is also needed at weekend events like plant sales and rose pruning demonstrations. Look over the following list and see how you might help us, or propose other ways you would like to help -- we are open to suggestions! Remember, couples and friends can work together on any of these projects! Don't miss out on these volunteer and learning opportunities!  YES, I WANT TO HELP! If you are interested in helping in any of the areas listed, or would like more information with no obligation, contact us.  The Gardens hosts an Annual Volunteer Appreciation Evening to recognize the efforts of our hard-working volunteers.
