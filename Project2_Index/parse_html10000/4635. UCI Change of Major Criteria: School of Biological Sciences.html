Completion at UCI of at least 5 required science courses for the major, 3 of which must be in the biological sciences. Other Junior-level standing (90 or more units). Limited to 30 new majors each year. If the eligible applicant pool exceed 30, the following additional criteria will be used: Completion of/performance in Bio Sci D103 and Bio Sci D104. Student's GPA in required biology courses. Students applying at the end of their sophomore year will be given preference over those applying later so that students can participate in the program for two years rather than one without exceeding their time to degree beyond four years total.   Timeline Applications to declare the major can be made at any time with review of applications and selection to the major by the Faculty Advisory Board.
