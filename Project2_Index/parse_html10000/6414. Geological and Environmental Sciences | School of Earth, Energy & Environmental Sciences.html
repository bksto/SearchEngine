In GES, fields of research and education encompass the entire planet from its deep interior to the surface, throughout the long span of geological time up to the human timescale. The scale of view ranges from global to atomic. Physical, chemical, and biological processes as well as the unique history of the Earth are within our broad scope.  Research Groups Geological and Environmental Sciences focuses on the history and structure of the Earth, the physics and chemistry of Earth materials, the processes that cycle those materials on a global scale, and the interaction of human activities with geological processes and resources. Learn More Graduate Program Graduate Studies in the Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences (GES) involve academic course work and independent research. Students are prepared for careers as professional scientists in research, education, or the application of the earth sciences to mineral, energy, and water resources. Programs lead to the M.S., Engineer, and Ph.D. degrees. Learn More Undergraduate Program The purpose of the undergraduate program in Geological and Environmental Sciences is to provide students with (1) a broad background in the fundamentals of the Earth sciences and (2) the quantitative, analytical, and communications skills necessary to conduct research and think critically about questions involving the Earth. Learn More Research Facilities Our researchers have access to a wide variety of laboratories and equipment, either within our department or in associated departments. Learn More Industrial Affiliate Programs Stanford encourages the close collaboration with companies and welcomes industry to participate in our research.

Gould that marine creatures underwent an “early burst” of functional diversity during the dawn of animal life. Animals tend to evolve toward larger sizes over time Stanford School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences New Stanford research shows that animals tend to evolve toward larger body sizes over time. Over the past 542 million years, the mean size of marine animals has increased 150-fold. Thanks to the top teachers Stanford School Of Earth Sciences Professors in the School of Earth Sciences who are making ongoing and consistent contributions to teaching were recognized at a recent faculty dinner.  View All News Support Us Make a Gift Upcoming Events GES Department Seminar: Richard Iverson, USGS Cacades Volcano Observatory March 31, 2015 - 12:10am to 1:10am GeoCorner, Room 220 GES Department Seminar: Carl Jacobson, Iowa State May 5, 2015 - 12:10pm to 1:10pm GeoCorner, Room 220 GES Department Seminar: Ying Fan Reinfelder, Rutgers May 19, 2015 - 12:10pm to 1:10pm GeoCorner, Room 220 SU Home Maps & Directions Search Stanford Terms of Use Emergency Info © Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305.
