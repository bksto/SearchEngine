The program provides experience of art historical and theoretical questions through two introductory survey-style classes and a range of topics-based classes. Curriculum The principal functions of the art history program are to infuse awareness of the visual arts and practices of looking into the college curriculum, and to introduce students to the histories of art-making and visual representation. In its focus on visual competency, art history at Redlands relates closely to the visual and media studies program (and many art history classes count toward the visual and media studies major). Historical understanding of the role of visual culture in different societies—not only the traditional fine arts of painting, sculpture and architecture, but also an array of media including the graphic and photographic, and so-called "crafts"—is important in developing a reflective understanding of the world. Skills After successfully completing the art history minor, you will demonstrate: A developed ability to identify and address the discipline-specific problems of art history; Secure knowledge of a range of theories informing art historical practice and the ability to apply these; A capacity to situate the methodologies of art history within the broader context of the humanities and social sciences. All minors are required to gain hands-on experience of art making in at least one art studio class.
