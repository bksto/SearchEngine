Bordered by iconic neighborhoods — Bel Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills — UCLA is a crossroads of ideas, cultures and limitless experiences and opportunities. Whether it's getting an acting gig as an extra in Hollywood or catching the last set at the Coachella music festival, strolling down the Sunset Strip or taking your first ride up Pacific Coast Highway — at UCLA, the journey is the destination. Los Angeles is a global city where culture, business and industry blend into opportunity. This is where 4 million people power the world's 15th largest economy. Where internship opportunities abound in the entertainment industry and with major corporations like Boeing, Skechers, Nestlè and Dole. It's a diverse cultural landscape, where you can experience Asia, Latin America and everywhere in between in a single afternoon. And as a UCLA student, you'll be given every resource and opportunity to take advantage of all L.A. has to offer.
