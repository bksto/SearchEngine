A Living Laboratory At the UC Riverside Botanic Gardens, we're about connecting people with nature. Come explore the four miles of scenic trails, view our more than 3,500 plant species from around the world — or just relax on a bench and enjoy the beauty. Nestled in the foothills of the Box Springs Mountains on the east side of campus, the Gardens cover 40 hilly acres. As a living classroom without walls, we provide a wide assortment of materials for courses at UCR as well as other local schools in courses ranging from botany and anthropology to entomology and photography. Guided Tour of the Gardens Stop by for a guided tour, an afternoon of bird-watching, or just for a leisurely walk to appreciate the beauty of nature.
