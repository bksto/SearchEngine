Assistance can be in the form of grants, loans and work-study. Students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year in order to be eligible for need-based financial aid. Undergraduate students should submit their FAFSA applications by March 2 each year to qualify for the maximum amount of financial aid that they are eligible for. Our federal school code is 001322. Please feel free to contact Student Financial Services with any questions you have about this process.
