If you have an interest in investing in these priorities, you are invited to learn more. Access Illinois Access Illinois is a broad initiative that seeks support for scholarships. You can participate by making a gift to the campus General Scholarship Fund, Illinois Promise, The James Newton Matthews Scholars Program or to your college scholarship fund. Chancellor's Fund Annual gifts to the Chancellor’s Fund offer the campus the ability to support emerging needs, exciting opportunities and impactful ideas. Each year, the Chancellor looks across the campus to determine where funds could best be used. Over the past several years, the Chancellor’s Fund has been used to provide much-needed scholarship support for exceptional students; complete campus beautification projects – most notably, the restoration of the iconic Alma Mater statue; support academic and research initiatives for students and faculty; and much more. This year, the Chancellor has granted funds to five projects all across the campus. Gifts from alumni and friends are being used to support the restoration of the 117-year old telescope housed in the Observatory; construct a residential suite in the soon-to-be built Center for Wounded Veterans in Higher Education; allow Scientific Animations without Borders (SAWBO) to create additional animated videos viewable on cell phones to educate people in developing countries in areas such as health, agriculture, and disaster-relief; restore gardens and modernize facilities at one of the University’s treasured sites, Allerton Park & Retreat Center, and create a solar village on the campus’ Energy Farm by bringing together the homes developed by teams of students for elite competition in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Decathlon.
