Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary undertaking devoted to scholarship on the histories, political and cultural movements, institutions, economies and identities of Africans and the African diaspora across the globe. Africa’s own overlapping modernities and the transnational migrations of its peoples – whether forced or voluntary – have complicated the meanings of “black” and “African” identities and experiences, prompting us to rethink the geographical boundaries and conceptual paradigms surrounding the production of knowledge about Africa and its diasporic communities. NYU's location in one of the western hemisphere’s most cosmopolitan cities – home to many of the broad constituencies we aim to study in relation to their other continental settings – places us in a privileged position to lead and shape the development of Africana Studies in the 21st century. Accordingly, the program is a site for interdisciplinary and cross-cultural teaching and research in the histories, cultures, economies, politics, and languages and cultural practices of Africans in Africa, the Americas–North and South, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle-East. The program maintains close relationships with community programming and research activities by NYU's Institute of African-American Affairs and Africa House.Learn More Awam Amkpa, Interim Director of Africana Studies Announcements African Languages at NYU Studying Abroad: NYU Accra (Ghana) SCA Events Calendar 2014-2015 Africana Studies Fulbright Fellows Quicklinks About Arts and Science Academic Calendar Contact Us | © New York University, Arts and Science
