Hilton College – San Antonio Conrad N. Hilton College – Lima Global Hospitality Master's Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor Gourmet Night Sugar Land Wine & Food Affair Cougar Grounds Barron’s Restaurant Meet the Dean John Bowen, dean of Hilton College and Barron Hilton Distinguished Chair, became fascinated with hotels at a young age. The world inside a hotel seemed like a small city to him, and the inner workings captured his imagination. He's been involved in the hospitality industry ever since. After graduating with a degree in hotel administration, Dean Bowen joined the U.S. Navy and ran the hotel at the base where he was stationed in Orlando, Florida. He gained extensive industry experience after the Navy working in food & beverage management positions at hotels and restaurants in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and Texas. He also ran his own tavern in Dallas, John T's—later known as Theodore Zinck's—for 15 years. He's devoted the last few decades to academia, teaching, publishing and researching at Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, Bond University in Australia, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and the University of Houston's Hilton College. Dean Bowen became dean of Hilton College in 2003 and continues to bring his enthusiasm for hospitality to students, faculty, alumni, industry partners and donors alike. He's still fascinated with hotels and the hospitality industry and wants to pass on that passion to Hilton College students.
