Worcester Polytechnic Institute About WPI Academics Admissions Research Campus Life Athletics Skip to Additional Navigation Home  > Academics > Faculty Faculty In addition to being passionate about teaching, WPI professors are committed researchers and scholars with world class credentials. They bring their research into the classroom and give students an opportunity to get involved. Like their students, they don’t just believe in making the world a better place through science and technology–they’re doing it. WPI professors inspire and encourage their students as they drive them to higher achievement and greater success. They don’t give students the answers; they show them how to find them.
