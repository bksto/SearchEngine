Included in each first year class are six Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) students who will receive a Ph.D. in addition to their M.D. and 12 students participating in the Program in Medical Education for the Latino Community (PRIME-LC). The PRIME-LC students will obtain a masters degree and an M.D. upon completion of their training to become leaders in health care in the underserved Latino communities. Once in medical school, approximately 40% of our student body prior to graduation from medical school obtain other degrees, e.g. an MBA or MPH, or take time to gain additional research experience. Selection of each class is based on several factors including academics, involvement in research, clinical exposure, community service, and extracurricular activities. Leadership and personal qualities, as determined by interviews and letters of recommendation, are also important selection factors. Each class is carefully chosen as to have a diverse group of students with a broad range of experiences and backgrounds so as to enhance the learning experience of the class.
