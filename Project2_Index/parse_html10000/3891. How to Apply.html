Applying to UCSB The UC application is only available online at the University of California website. As a rule, UC Santa Barbara accepts applications from first-time freshman and junior-level transfer students only. The only exception is the College of Creative Studies, which will accept applications for senior-level transfer. Usually, UCSB only accepts applications in the fall quarter and is closed for winter and spring admission. Visit the Application Timeline page for specific application dates for freshman, transfer and international applicants. Application Fees and Waivers The filing fee for each University of California campus you apply to is $70. For international applicants, the filing fee is $80 per campus. Fee Waivers There are fee waivers available for individuals who meet eligibility guidelines based on household size and family income. Please check with your high school's college counselor for more information. When you apply online, you may request a review for a fee waiver in section 8 of the UC application. The fee waiver can be used to apply to up to four UC campuses. If you wish to apply to more than four campuses, you must pay the $70 fee for each additional campus. Personal Statement The University of California requires a personal statement as part of the undergraduate application for admission. Your essay will help Office of Admissions counselors discover a sense of you as an individual and envision the contributions you might make to UCSB. The personal statement consists of two prompts, and applicants must answer both prompts in 1,000 words or less. For more information, download a Personal Statement help sheet in the right column. Applying to a Late or Closed Term Filing deadlines are rarely extended. To apply for admission after a filing period has ended or for a UCSB term that will be closed to new applicants, you must submit a written appeal. Consideration for appeals is based on your overall application and extenuating circumstances. In your letter of appeal, please include: A statement describing your special circumstances. The quarter and year for which you are applying. Whether you are applying as a freshman or transfer student. Intended major. Full legal name (no nicknames). Address and phone number. E-mail address. Date of birth. The last four digits of your social security number (if applicable). Copies of all transcripts. Mail your appeal to: Admissions Review Committee UCSB Office of Admissions 1210 Cheadle Hall Santa Barbara, CA 93106-2014 Or fax a copy to: (805) 893-2676 You should receive written notification that of the decision within four to six weeks after the Office of Admissions receives your appeal. If the appeal is granted, you may then fill out an electronic application online. Please note that the data in your application will need to match the data in your appeal letter for the online application to be processed. If you have already applied to UC, but wish to add UCSB as a campus choice, the process is the same. However, if the appeal is granted, you do not have to do anything more. The central processor will bill you for the application fee by mail.
