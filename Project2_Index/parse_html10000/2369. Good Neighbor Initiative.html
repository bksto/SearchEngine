Good Neighbor Initiative Interns work diligently with the UCSC University Relations Office to bridge communication between neighbors, students, the city, and the university. Interns provide student interface with neighbors and are glad to field any suggestions, responses, or policy ideas to improve the university's relations. The goal of the Good Neighbor Initiative program is to foster good relations between everyone in the Santa Cruz community! Some projects that the interns have done in the past include helping create a UCSC Campus Walking Map, holding Housing Workshops for students interested in moving off campus, and creating a "Good Neighbor Guidelines" brochure for students and residents alike to read.   Aron Garst, Intern Phone: 831-459-1768 Email: gnintern@ucsc.edu Christine West, Intern Phone: 831-459-1768 Email: gnintern@ucsc.edu Donna Blitzer, Director of Government Relations Phone: 831-459-3938 Fax: 831-459-2601 Email: dblitzer@ucsc.edu Richelle Noroyan, Community Relations Representative Phone: 831-459-1768 Fax: 831-459-2601 Email: rnoroyan@ucsc.edu UC Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, Ca 95064 ©2014 Regents of the University of California.
