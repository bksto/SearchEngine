Throughout history, women have challenged the status quo. Whether striving for voting rights, pushing for equal opportunity in the workplace, or raising awareness of women’s health, women have shown exceptional vision, strength of character, and determination. During this month, we celebrate the accomplishments of women and critically reflect on what our nation must do to ensure gender equality and justice for all. About Women’s History Month The Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (Calif.) Commission on the Status of Women initiated a “Women’s History Week” celebration in 1978 and chose the week of March 8 to coincide with International Women’s Day. In 1981, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., co-sponsored the first Joint Congressional Resolution proclaiming a “Women’s History Week.” In 1987, the National Women’s History Project petitioned Congress to expand the celebration to the entire month of March. Since then, the National Women’s History Month Resolution has been approved every year with bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.
