We work with campus and community partners to support successful educational experiences both in and out of the classroom. Through our programs and services, students have the opportunity to explore their interests through a wide array of events and activities; connect with a diverse community of students, staff, and faculty; and be challenged to actively engage in building skills to preparing students to become strong and successful in the world beyond college. Community Standards and Student Support Learning also involves reflecting on decisions and improving decision-making skills. Students are expected to maintain high standards of personal conduct, respect the rights of others, and participate actively in fostering the well-being of this unique educational community.
