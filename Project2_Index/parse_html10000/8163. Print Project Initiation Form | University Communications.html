The Office of Communications will suggest content edits to ensure editorial style consistency and accuracy. Clients should provide edits to the PDF proof using Adobe Acrobat's built-in features (comments, highlight, strike-through found in the tool bar). If the client does not have this capability, typed comments are the next best option. Handwritten comments on the proof are the least preferred format for feedback.
