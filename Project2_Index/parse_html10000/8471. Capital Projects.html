Support Redlands University of Redlands > Support Redlands > Capital Projects Capital Projects In our dynamic world, the University of Redlands must focus on today but always keep an eye to the future. Our Stauffer Complex for Science, Mathematics and Environmental Studies is a perfect example. Capital gifts, received a decade ago, built a state of the art science complex. The result has been a significant growth in science students and recognition of our program as a leader in science education. Forward-looking planning requires a continual investment in building projects. Capital projects are an investment in the future of Redlands and represent an immediate need for private support, whether for new construction or expansion or refurbishment of existing facilities. It is this investment in tomorrow that will continue to ensure a quality liberal arts education. Gifts to capital projects are typically larger and are often paid incrementally over a period of a few years. Recently completed projects include the new Peppers Art Center, the expansion of Wallichs Theater, and the renovation and expansion of Armacost Library. We are currently in the planning stages for the next big project to make the Redlands student experience even better.
