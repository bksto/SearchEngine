Auhll Professorship and Dean's Chair in Engineering (CoE) Letter from the Chair These are exciting times for ECE… We have just concluded a very successful faculty hiring cycle that brought to our campus two top researchers — Yuan Xie and Alberto Giovanni Busetto — and we have several more hires in the works. This aggressive hiring policy is enabling us to overcome the challenges arising from recent and pending retirements. It is also allowing us to create new areas of strength for the department that are aligned with current scientific and technological trends. I encourage you to read the latest issue of The ECE Current (Fall 2014), which contains several articles devoted to our greatest accomplishments:  our students. You will read about preeminent alumni, the achievements of recent seniors in launching new businesses, and our efforts to attract minority and underprivileged students to our campus. A word of thanks to our donors, whose generosity allowed us to bring new equipment to our teaching labs and to improve some of our educational spaces.
