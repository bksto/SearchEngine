The purpose of this website is to provide basic information about numerous aspects of the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Furthermore, OBP hopes that by presenting this data in an electronic format it will be an efficient way for campus administrators and others to access the information they often need in the planning and management of the institution. The newest addition to the OBP web site is the Michigan Almanac, a compendium of charts and descriptions covering all facets of activities on the Ann Arbor campus. As part of the ongoing effort to keep the site up-to-date and, when possible, improve it, please feel free to send your comments and suggestions. You can send any thoughts you have about our web site to obpcontact@umich.edu. © 2013, 2014, 2015 The Regents of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109    Email: obpcontact@umich.edu   Phone: (734) 763-9954   Fax: (734) 763-0413
