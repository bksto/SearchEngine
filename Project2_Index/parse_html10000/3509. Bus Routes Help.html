Howdy! This help page will guide you through the design and features of the new Bus Routes website. It is broken down into 3 sections The Bus Routes Menu Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) I cannot see leave times for my route! Where did they go? I cannot bookmark my route! Features You Might Be Interested In The Bus Routes Menu Menu: The Menu icon appears on mobile phones, and other small screens. Clicking or tapping on the menu icon will display the Route Selector, Date Selector, High Contrast button, and Bus Refresh button. Aggie Spirit logo: Clicking or tapping on the Aggie Spirit logo will take you to the default Bus Routes map, which displays all regular routes. Bus Routes: Clicking or tapping on the Bus Routes icon toggles displaying the list of available routes. Routes are grouped into On Campus, and Off Campus. During football season a Game Day section will also appear. Time Table: Clicking or tapping on the Time Table icon toggles displaying of the time table for the route. A black time table icon indicates that there is a time table available. A grey time table icon indicates that there is no time table available. Service Dates: Clicking or tapping on the Service Dates icon toggles the list of service dates. The list of service dates is a list of the dates when Transportation Services will change the level of bus service offered. An explanation of how the service will change is also given for the service date change. Common service date change entries are: Regular Service, Break Service, No Service. When service date changes are available, the Service Dates icon will change from grey to black. Announcements: Clicking or tapping on the Announcements icon toggles the list of announcements. Announcements in the list come from the Transportation Services feed and contains information that Transportation Services has decided is important for our customers to know in a timely manner. When announcements are available, the announcements icon will change from grey to black. Date Selector: Clicking or tapping on the Date Selector allows you to request route and time table information for a different date. The type of selector displayed depends on your device. A laptop/desktop browser that supports HTML5, like Chrome, will display a calendar-style date picker. If your browser does not support HTML5 date selectors, you will see a javascript calendar-style date selector. iPhones will display the standard rolling-style date selector. Android phones will display the standard scrolling Month/Day/Year date selector High Contrast: Clicking or tapping on the High Contrast icon toggles high contrast mode. Selecting High Contrast mode changes the color scheme from the standard route color to Maroon & White. When High Contrast mode is selected, the icon changes from grey to black. This setting is persistent across routes and sessions, meaning that if you select High Contrast mode and then select a different route, the route will be displayed in high contrast. Also, if you select High Contrast mode, close the browser, then return to the bus routes site later, High Contrast mode will still be enabled. This functionality is accomplished through HTML5 localStorage settings. If your browser does not support this functionality, or if this fuctionality is somehow disabled (private viewing mode on Safari, for example), High Contrast mode will have to be re-enabled each time the selected route is changed. 15 15 Bus Position Refresh Clicking or tapping Bus Position Refresh toggles the countdown on and off. When the Bus Position Refresh is on, the icon is black, and the countdown number is white. When the countdown reaches 0, the bus position markers are updated to the latest position reported by each bus. Frequently Asked Questions I cannot see leave times for my route! Where did they go? Click or tap the Time Table icon to drop the table of leave times down. Time tables default to hidden when the site is viewed on a device with a small screen, like a mobile phone. If you are using a device with a larger screen, like a tablet, laptop, or desktop, the table of leave times will display automatically when you select a route. I cannot bookmark my route! The problem with bookmarking on the new site has been corrected. However, if you are still experiencing problems, here is a list of links to the individual route pages.
