In all of our work, we emphasize university-community partnerships that are collaborative, participatory, empowering, systemic, and transformative. As a Carnegie designated community engaged university, we reach out intentionally and strategically to all the communities we serve, from underrepresented students to tribal neighbors to military establishments to health organizations to the business community to create partnerships that help address the region's most critical issues.  Whether through the service learning/civic engagement activities of our students or the engaged scholarship and research of our faculty, CSUSM is working in collaboration with its community partners to serve the public good.
