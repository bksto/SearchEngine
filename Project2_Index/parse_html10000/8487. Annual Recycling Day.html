Students compete against students from other area schools in the annual Recycle Day Can Construction Challenge, creating a sculpture out of recyclable materials. Members of the community donate soda can tabs, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, glass and other recyclables, which Redlands students then use to create art. Proceeds from the recycling effort benefit the Loma Linda Ronald McDonald House. Through the years, the widely covered event has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Loma Linda Ronald McDonald House, a home away from home for the families of children receiving treatment at Loma Linda University Children’s Hospital and other nearby facilities.
