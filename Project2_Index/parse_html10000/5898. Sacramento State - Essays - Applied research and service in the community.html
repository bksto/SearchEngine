Our studentseven undergraduateshave opportunities to work directly with professors on original research. And internships and service learning, where students can apply what theyve been taught to real-world settings, are an integral part of the Sacramento State experience. For instance, biology students are helping the Sacramento crime lab with DNA matching. Speech pathology students are guiding stroke victims in regaining their speech. Engineering students are building working robots. Government students are staffing legislative offices at the State Capitol. Art students are teaching underserved children to paint. Its invaluable experience that helps students expand their horizons, gain confidence, build job skills and make important contacts in their areas of study.
