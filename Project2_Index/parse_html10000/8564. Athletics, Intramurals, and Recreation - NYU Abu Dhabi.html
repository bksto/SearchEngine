Competitive play for the ADISL League resumes in February. Men’s Basketball (5-0) The Falcons men’s basketball team, undefeated in ADISL action, participated in 3 tournaments so far this season capturing titles in the inaugural NYUAD Saadiyat Island Winter Classic and the UAEU National Day events and a quarterfinal appearance in EuroRoma 2014 in Rome. The team is set to continue its back-to-back ADISL Championship run and will play in the Higher Education Sports Federation National Tournament this spring. Women’s Basketball (1-4) The 2014-2015 season has been a building year for women’s basketball. Practices and competitive play equipped many of the incoming freshmen from around the world with fundamental knowledge and skills of the game while simultaneously refining and polishing technique of returning players. The team looks forward to continued practice leading into next season, building the team’s balance and awareness of the game. Men’s Football (2-1) The men’s football team remains solidly in the hunt for a coveted ADISL playoffs spot. In February, the team faces matches against Abu Dhabi University, Masdar Institute, and Zayed University promising challenges through the end of the ADISL season. Women’s Football (W-1, D-2, L-1) The Lady Falcons women’s football team started off with a strong win and fought to the end of the Fall season, finishing with some tough draws and a loss. The team also faced challenging matches by players from around the world at the EuroRoma Tournament in Rome in November. The second half of the season kicks off in February with two very important games that will determine if they quality for the ADISL playoffs in March. Men’s Badminton (4-1) The Falcons men’s badminton team has practiced and played consistently well in the first half of the season, losing only to the top of the League team, Petroleum Institute. Working on their Doubles, currently, the first match of the second half of the season is against Masdar Institute on February 11th. The highest ranked players will also represent NYUAD at the Higher Education Sports Federation National Tournament in Sharjah on March 16th.

In addition, some of the players will be selected to participate in the Higher Education Sports Federation National Tournament in Dubai on March 17th. ADISL Standing: 1st in league, 4-0 record. Cricket (0-3) Results from the first half of the season aren’t a true reflection of the team’s potential. Practices were not ideal; the team worked with concrete nets and grass fields and found it difficult to transfer skills onto the cricket pitch in terms of batting and bowling consistency. There is a lot of promise for a stronger team in the second half of the season with students returning and fresh talent joining. The team keeps an eye on the prize of securing an ADISL championship and will keep forging ahead, working on all areas of play and continuing to draw on spirit and teamwork. The team’s next match is February 6th against Al Khawarizmi International College. Table Tennis (6-2) Three teams comprised of 14 committed players came out for the first half of the competitive season for table tennis. The top team currently lies third in the ADISL league, and the second half of the season kicks off on February 11th.
