They represent the most visible and accessible avenue to student involvement. They provide students with a variety of opportunities to explore their academic, professional, political, social, cultural, religious, and community service interests. These leadership experiences allow students to develop interpersonal, organizational, and leadership skills that can contribute to your marketability. Clubs & Organizations Welcome to the Clubs & Organizations website for California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH)! Students have over 70+ student clubs and organizations to choose from. It is helpful to identify what type of organization you are interested in joining.
