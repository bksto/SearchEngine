Housing is guaranteed for four years for entering freshmen. Approximately 96 percent of all undergraduates registered and residing at the home campus live in on-campus housing. The undergraduate housing system includes 80 diverse facilities. About 25 percent of students join one of the 16 fraternities or 14 sororities recognized on campus.
