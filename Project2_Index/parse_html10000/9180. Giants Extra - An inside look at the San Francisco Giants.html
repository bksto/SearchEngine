He is one of very few power threats in the Giants lineup, he has played 162 games in each of the past two seasons and his fractured forearm leaves the Giants suddenly asking themselves a question they haven’t needed to ask in 2 ½ years: Who’s playing in right field? But as the clocks spring ahead and a new week begins, the focus will turn elsewhere. The pitching staff.

It is a place to deconstruct the negative. Joe Lefebvre prefers to accentuate the positive. When the Giants held their first hitter’s meeting of the spring a week ago, Lefebvre and Hensley Meulens, the club’s hitting coaches, devised a unique presentation. It was show-and-tell, and the video clips they put together could’ve passed as a rough cut for a World Series highlights DVD.

Writing for a print edition will never leave my DNA. (I covered last night’s Stanford men’s basketball game at ASU, a 9 p.m. tip, and am feeling pretty good about the fact that there isn’t a big block of white space in this morning’s paper.) But it hasn’t been part of my daily duties for 3+ years, so it’s caused me to reevaluate how we can best serve you while also making the workload as efficient as possible (not writing every single scrap of information two ways for two different information channels). I always figured there was limited crossover between readers who scanned the blog and readers who picked up the paper or cruised the main site. But the waters are a bit muddier now. Breaking news that I post on the blog is being slapped on the site, too. So it was suggested to me that I publish to the blog everything I file for the paper. We’ll try that out and see how it goes. And as always, whatever other notes or musings I can’t fit into the paper will still have plenty of room to appear here in a separate post. There will be some duplication, sure, but hopefully it’ll be helpful for you to find comprehensive info in either space. I’ll be eager to hear your feedback. And as always, thanks for reading. Today’s Pence story and notes for print are below. -Baggs SURPRISE, Ariz. – Hunter Pence arrived at the Giants’ spring complex Friday morning, his left arm wrapped in a cast, and asked the medical staff what he could do. They told him he couldn’t do anything. That’s like telling a shark to stop swimming, isn’t it? “Well, doing nothing is doing something, because I’m healing,” said Pence, his smile outshining the disappointment of a fractured forearm that will cause him to start the season on the disabled list. “So that’s something to do.” Continue Reading → 2015 SF Giants spring training, Hunter Pence 198 Hunter Pence says he’s a quick healer, predicts arm fracture will be “a great blessing” Posted on March 6, 2015 by Andrew Baggarly SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Hunter Pence says he’s a fast healer. He’s certainly quick to provide forgiveness. A day after Pence fractured his left forearm when hit by a pitch, he responded to Chicago Cubs minor league right-hander Corey Black on Twitter. Black posted that he was “lost for words. Hope you heal fast @hunterpence. Hitting someone is never a good feeling. Hurting someone is even worse.” Replied Pence: “It happens my friend. Thanks for the concern. It’s a part of the game we love. No slowing down!” Continue Reading → Uncategorized 168 EXTRA BAGGS: Don’t expect Giants to make reaction move to Pence injury, etc. Posted on March 5, 2015 by Andrew Baggarly Hunter Pence does everything at full-throttle speed. The Giants are hoping that he’s a fast healer, too. As you probably know, Pence will be out 6-8 weeks after X-rays confirmed he sustained a non-displaced ulnar fracture just above his left wrist Thursday. The tests confirmed the initial diagnosis. Even Pence, as optimistic as they come, appeared to fear the worst after getting struck by a pitch from Cubs minor league right-hander Corey Black in the sixth inning. Continue Reading → 2015 SF Giants spring training, Hunter Pence 243 UPDATE: X-rays confirm fractured left forearm for Giants’ Hunter Pence, out 6-8 weeks Posted on March 5, 2015 by Andrew Baggarly UPDATE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Hunter Pence is baseball’s foremost optimist. But he’s also a realist. From the moment an inside fastball struck him in the sixth inning Thursday, Pence feared he had sustained a fractured left forearm. X-rays confirmed as much, and as a result, the Giants’ Iron Man will begin the season on the disabled list. Pence was diagnosed with a non-displaced ulnar fracture and was being fitted with a cast; he is expected to be sidelined for 6-8 weeks, meaning the earliest he could return is mid-April. Pence was struck by a pitch from Cubs minor league right-hander Corey Black. He usually sprints to first base after he’s hit by a pitch but stayed down for several seconds before he began walking toward the base. Giants manager Bruce Bochy left the dugout during the Giants’ 8-6 victory over the Cubs and visited Pence in the training room. “You know Hunter. He’s always upbeat and optimistic,” Bochy said. “He was trying to move out of the way. It ran in and caught him there. It happens. If it is broken, the silver lining is that least it’s early in the spring, so he can start the healing process.” Pence famously has played in every game since joining the Giants at the July 31 trade deadline in 2012. His active streak of 383 consecutive games played is the longest in the majors and also ranks as the third longest in Giants history. Pence’s injury would mean more time for Gregor Blanco, who was set to open as an oft-used No.4 outfielder behind left fielder Nori Aoki and center fielder Angel Pagan. Juan Perez and non-roster invitee Justin Maxwell figure to get more playing time and an enhanced chance to make the club as well. Maxwell, because he’s a right-handed hitter with home run potential, could stand to benefit the most from Pence’s injury. Bochy already planned to give Maxwell a long look this spring. SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Giants right fielder Hunter Pence left Thursday afternoon’s exhibition after being hit on the hand with a pitch and was headed to the hospital for X-rays, the team said. Pence, who played in all 162 games last season, recoiled from an inside fastball thrown by Cubs minor league right-hander Corey Black. Check back for test results and an update later today. It was a dangerous day at Scottsdale Stadium. In the first inning, plate umpire Dale Scott was hit on the hand with a deflected ball and had to leave the game. For a time, umpire Jim Joyce called balls and strikes from a position near the mound. Uncategorized 174 Brandon Belt moves up in Giants lineup as Cubs come to town Posted on March 5, 2015 by Andrew Baggarly SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The last time the Giants and Cubs met for an early spring exhibition, a sudden storm rolled through Mesa, the grounds crew couldn’t get the tarp on the field in time, the field was rendered unplayable and the game was cancelled. Who says spring training results don’t translate to the regular season?

He’s accustomed to putting on the uniform, interacting with teammates and seeing Bruce Bochy in the dugout. But there’s one thing he hasn’t yet experienced. “Oh, it’s going to be a lot of fun to be in the same rotation with Matt Cain,” said Peavy, after making his spring debut Wednesday. “I can’t wait to work with him and learn from him.” Continue Reading → 2015 SF Giants spring training, Jake Peavy, Matt Cain 20 Derek Law takes big step in return from Tommy John surgery Posted on March 4, 2015 by Andrew Baggarly SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Giants right-hander Derek Law remains months away from resuming his pro career. The one-year anniversary of his Tommy John surgery won’t come until late June. But when you’ve spent months doing the same arm exercises over and over, it’s exhilarating just to stand on a slope again.

A sore shoulder will hasten that resolve.
