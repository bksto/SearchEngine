These include: operations planning, sourcing activities, production of goods and services, demand fulfillment and logistics, and the various customer support and return processes (such as retail returns, recycle and reconditioning). All successful organizations, whether they are for-profit, not-for-profit, governmental or public service rely to a great extent on supply chain management principles. Careers Many challenging opportunities exist for graduates in supply chain management. For example: Strategic sourcing specialist - Determines best sources of supply for most purchases. Negotiates prices, quality requirements and delivery terms and conditions. Logistics coordinator - Designs or improves logistics processes in an effort to improve service or reduce operational costs. Makes recommendations regarding warehouse operations, delivery options and transportation strategies. Process improvement specialist - Facilitates implementation of process improvements. Provides business input to improve system performance and delivery. Material planner - The material planner plans and schedules work through the manufacturing facility to meet the on-time delivery schedule and cost target commitments. Enterprise systems analyst – Responsibilities include assessing business needs and formulating solutions through the use of ERP and other applications, and initiating and leading related projects. Business data analyst – Interprets business performance results using a variety of techniques, ranging from simple data aggregation to complex data mining. Designs, develops, implements and maintains business solutions, and provides access to information in the form of data extracts and dashboards.

Course of Study In addition to the core upper level business courses the supply chain management major consists of 18 hours of SCM core courses and 6 hours of directed electives. The SCM core curriculum includes courses in logistics management, business modeling and analysis, strategic supply management, demand and supply integration, managing productivity and quality, and supply chain strategy. These courses comprise the body of knowledge required of all supply chain majors, and they provide the foundation for students to specialize in one of three career-specific tracks: energy supply management, strategic sourcing, and business analytics. Certificates Students who successfully complete 6 hours of specific electives can earn certificates as follows: Certificate Directed Electives Energy Supply Management Energy Supply Chain Project Mgt. for Energy Industries Strategic Sourcing Strategic Sourcing & Spend Analysis Enterprise Resource Planning Business Analytics Enterprise Resource Planning Advanced Business Modeling Note that to complete their degree requirements students only need to take any two electives from the list specified in the undergraduate catalog. In other words, students do not need to earn a specific certificate to graduate, they only need to complete the 6 hours of additional SCM electives. Additional information is contained in the SCM Certificates information sheet. Course Sequence The supply chain management curriculum requires 3 semesters to complete after successfully completing SCM 3301 with a C+ or better.
