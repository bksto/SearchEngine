Young is associate vice chancellor for nursing and founding dean of the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing at UC Davis. Young researches healthy aging with a particular focus on the interface between individuals and family as well as formal health-care systems. Her research played an instrumental role in shaping long-term care policies in Washington state and beyond and she has conducted several longitudinal studies of family caregiving in the context of cognitive decline. Her systems research includes medication management and safety in rural assisted-living settings and hospitals, as well as the use of technology-enabled care, such as telehealth, and community-based strategies to promote health. Young is an investigator with the Initiative for Wireless Health and Wellness at UC Davis and the Center for Information Technology Research for the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and is co-director of the Latino Aging Research Resource Center. She is the primary investigator for a recently approved $2.1 million Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute study seeking to improve health for individuals with diabetes. She leads at the national and state levels in supporting implementation of the recommendations of the landmark Institute of Medicine report, “The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health.” She is a member of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s national Strategic Advisory Committee as well as a member of the California Action Coalition executive committee. She served on the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) Working Group on Systems Engineering for Healthcare. Young is a UC Davis alumna, graduating in 1981 with a bachelor’s degree in Dietetics followed by an Associate Degree in Nursing from Sacramento City College and a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from Southern Oregon State College. She then went on to the University of Washington, where she earned a Master of Science in Nursing degree with a specialty in gerontology and a Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing Science.
