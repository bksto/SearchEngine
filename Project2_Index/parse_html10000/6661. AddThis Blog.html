AddThis Dashboard Menu Blog Stop Hiding the Best Content on Your Blog March 4, 2015 Justin Thorp AddThis Pro, Content Marketing, Features & Tips No comments We spend so much time creating content to get and sustain the attention of our audience. In spite of this, I can guarantee you that you’re not showing your website audience the content that they want to see because it’s not on your home page.

It’s time to start thinking about personalizing your content marketing so that you’re putting the right content in front of the right visitor at the right time.

Think about the audience you’re trying to reach and what your social media marketing goals are for that particular network. So, what’s your strategy for Instagram? Here are five tips to get you started: Continue reading → House of Cards, Monument Valley, and Design March 2, 2015 Jim Lane Current Events, Design No comments Millions of people enjoyed the new season of House of Cards on Netflix this weekend. If you were one of them, you might have noticed Frank Underwood playing a beautiful game in episode five called Monument Valley. Some have even written about parallels between Underwood and the 2014 award-winning game’s heroine, Ida. Such prominent placement will surely be a boost for the popularity of the game, and it was a welcome alternative to the more typical analogy of chess and politics.

Start Personalizing. February 24, 2015 Justin Thorp AddThis Pro, Features & Tips, Personalization 5 comments Today, UX designers have an impossible task. Create an online experience that directs a visitor to whatever their goal is, on a website that has a lot of different potential audiences with competing interests. Think about it from a visitor’s perspective. This is pretty rough. If you only fall into one or two of a website’s 3 or 4 different audiences, you’re always being forced to endure a lot of content that’s not relevant to what you’re looking for. Because of this, visitors often don’t find what they’re looking for and will bounce off your website.

In my effort to do so, I frequently visit different websites and blogs like Smashing Magazine, OneExtraPixel, Webdesigner Depot, TechCrunch, and many more. I also use a Chrome plugin called Muz.li, which provides feeds of all the major trends, freebies, and design blogs. It’s amazing! I highly recommend it. Typography plays a big role in great user experience, and to make this happen you need access to modern and beautiful fonts. So, I did some digging on what fonts are trending these days and how you can access them (well, at least most of them) for free. Continue reading → And the Oscar Goes to…?
