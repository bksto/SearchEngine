Admission Volunteers College Counselors Parents/Families Admission Volunteers (OVAL) Volunteer Roles Admit Reception Host Held at the conclusion of the Restrictive Early Action (January/February) and/or Regular Decision (April) cycles, the admit receptions are a celebration for students and their families. Hosts identify reception locations (typically in alumni homes), coordinate details for set-up and refreshments, and support associated costs. Admit Reception Volunteers Volunteers attend receptions for admitted prospective students in their areas. Duties include meeting, greeting and congratulating admits and their families, sharing information about Stanford, and generally serving as ambassadors to welcome these constituents to the Stanford family. Alumni Interviews Interviewers are assigned to meet with Stanford applicants for a casual, comfortable, conversation. The interviewer's role is twofold: to convey impressions of the student to the admission committee and to share one's own Stanford experiences for the benefit of the applicant. Interviewers must be Stanford alumni and must complete a training session. While graduate alumni may participate, a strong understanding of and identification with Stanford's unique undergraduate experience is essential. Interviews are conducted between October and February. Interviewers of applicants who are admitted are invited to make congratulatory phone calls to those students. Chapter Leadership Team OVAL's highest-level volunteers, Leadership Team members (including Chapter Chairs) oversee other volunteers in their areas and serve as first point of contact in their areas for the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Regional chair duties can include: recruiting local OVAL volunteers; coordinating volunteers for receptions, information sessions, congratulatory phone calls and college fairs; organizing and leading volunteer training sessions; and (where applicable) assisting with the interview matching process and follow-up efforts and (where applicable) coordinating the local interview program. College Fair Representative Volunteers represent Stanford at college fairs worldwide answering questions, distributing materials (provided by the Office of Undergraduate Admission), and generally serving as ambassadors for Stanford when admission officers cannot be present. Information Session Volunteer Volunteers assist admission staff with regional events designed to provide information about Stanford to prospective students and their families. Duties can include: helping to secure or prepare a venue; meeting, greeting and checking-in participants; mingling and answering questions, and generally serving as local ambassadors for Stanford. Information Session Panelist Information session panelists speak at selected regional events. They are invited to share their experiences at Stanford as they pertain to academics, extracurricular activities, athletics, study abroad opportunities, residential education, and student life in general. Panelists are often recent graduates from Stanford. Parents may also occasionally serve as panelists, sharing their Stanford experience with other prospective parents in attendance. Interview Training Workshops Interview training workshops (typically in September and October) are often in private homes or workplace conference rooms. Hosts identify workshop venues, coordinate details for set-up and refreshments, and support associated costs.
