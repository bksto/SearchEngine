Giants Extra An inside look at the San Francisco Giants Search for: Menu Close Home About Andrew Baggarly 198 Hunter Pence says he’s a quick healer, predicts arm fracture will be “a great blessing” Posted on March 6, 2015 by Andrew Baggarly SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Hunter Pence says he’s a fast healer. He’s certainly quick to provide forgiveness. A day after Pence fractured his left forearm when hit by a pitch, he responded to Chicago Cubs minor league right-hander Corey Black on Twitter. Black posted that he was “lost for words. Hope you heal fast @hunterpence. Hitting someone is never a good feeling. Hurting someone is even worse.” Replied Pence: “It happens my friend. Thanks for the concern. It’s a part of the game we love. No slowing down!” Pence will have to take at least a partial timeout, though. When he arrived at Scottsdale Stadium on Friday, his arm in a cast, and asked what he could do, the medical staff told him there’s nothing he could do. Hunter Pence doing nothing…how does that work, exactly? Advertisement “Well, doing nothing is doing something, because I’m healing,” said Pence, smiling. “So that’s something to do.” Pence is expected to miss six to eight weeks and didn’t have many more details about the timetable, but he hopes to come back quicker than that. He was as upbeat as you might imagine, joking that the saddest part of all this is his inability to comb his hair. He even predicted that the injury would turn into “a great blessing.” Here’s his full 10-minute interview with reporters: Q: How’d you sleep last night? A: You know, I slept pretty good. Did the research on how you’re supposed to try to sleep and just kind of propped it up on a pillow and went to sleep. Q: You seem to be handling this pretty well. A: I mean, yeah. You control what you control and these things happen. It’s part of the game. You can never be upset when you’re competing and something happens and there’s no malicious intent. So it really couldn’t’ have happened at a much better time. I have a lot of time to get healthy for the regular-season games, and so I’m grateful that it was timed this early. Q: Did you know right away it was fractured? A: I mean, there’s no way of knowing, but I knew … yeah. I had a good feeling. Q: Or a bad feeling. A: (laughs) I had a confident feeling that it wasn’t good when it hit me. Q: You’ve broken your wrist and pinky before. How did they heal? A: Outstanding. I heal pretty fast generally, usually quicker than I’m supposed to. Q: They told us 6-8 weeks. Do you hope to be back sooner? A: We’ll see. I’ll do the best that I can, focus as hard as I can. I love to play so I’ll take care of all that I can, but also be here for the guys, help with whatever little parts I can even if I can’t physically play. Q: How soon can you start working out? A: I don’t know yet. When I came in I asked, `Is there anything I can do today?’ And they said, `No, there isn’t anything you can do today.’ So that’s the extent of that information that I have. Q: Have you allowed yourself to think you probably won’t be on the field for opening day? A: No, I’m not really focusing on that. I’m taking on today, and regardless of whether or not I’m able to play at that point, the focus is on the team. You know? The focus is on doing everything we can to make the playoffs and chase the dream of winning the World Series. There’s a huge process involved in that, so that’s the main focus: trying to get the most out each and every one of us. Saddest part is I can’t really comb my hair anymore, so I apologize for what you have to look at. Q: This could have a serious impact on your gaming, too. A: (laughs) I haven’t been gaming since I got here. But you know, you could do tablet gaming, maybe. Advertisement Q: Did they tell you how long the cast would be on? A: No idea. Q: However long it takes to heal, you know your version of spring training will become hyper-accelerated. Will it take you long to get your baseball timing back? A: Who knows. I think a lot of that is mental. There’s also ways you can get your timing back. Watching on the machine, watching the games, and I’ll try mentally to keep all that sharp. So we’ll see. Q: You reached out on Twitter to the pitcher (Corey Black) who hit you. Was that important when you saw how upset he was? A: Yeah, I heard about the tweet this morning, and I think some of the fans were getting on him. But you can’t… I have no hard feelings towards him. I have no hard feelings toward the situation. It happens and that’s the respect among competitors. We’re here to compete and there are dangers. Let’s say I hit a ball that hits a pitcher. I’m not happy I hit the pitcher. Them too. They’re trying to execute a plan and sometimes it just doesn’t work out that way. I think it’s just respect among competitors. There are other times I’ve been involved in games when you’re hit on purpose. Those things happen, and those things you’re a little more upset about. But this is nothing. This is part of the game. Q: When they tell you there’s nothing you can do … what do you do? You’re the kind of person who’s always itching to do something. A: Well, doing nothing is doing something, because I’m healing. So that’s something to do. I think there’s a couple things, a couple questions. As far as physical workouts they told me there’s nothing I can do today but there are things we can discuss, how we are going to heal this as quick as possible. There’s a couple scenarios we’re looking at not even regarding the arm, so we’ll see. Q: It’s not your throwing arm so is it more a matter of getting your timing back? A: Timing I’m not too worried about. I’m more worried about just getting the wrist strong enough. Once I get the wrist strong enough to where I can do this (demonstrates rotation after contact in his swing) it should be fine. Q: Did you receive a lot of support from teammates? A: Yeah. It was really, the amount of texts and support was, it was really touching. To me it didn’t feel like it was that big a deal. It was a bone. I’m not dying. And a month, I should be back pretty good. It happened at the perfect time. But still, all the concern felt really good. The fan support really was pretty special. Q: Does it make it easier that you’ve seen Gregor Blanco step in for Melky Cabrera in 2012 and Angel Pagan last year? A: Yeah, we have a lot of really, really good outfielders and Blanco looks great. He’s always ready to play. We have all the faith in the world in him. We also have some other guys who are really good too. We’ve got Juan Perez, we’ve got (Justin) Maxwell. We’ve got Aoki obviously, expected to start every day. We’ve got a strong unit and that’s the key. That’s what the focus is. It’s on the unit, and we’ll find the perfect balance to get the most out of our potential. I feel great. I feel positive. Things will be fine. Q: A beautiful disaster, as you say. A: Yes! It could end up being … I think it’s going to end up being a great blessing. I think so. Q: Really? A: Yeah. It always finds a way to do that.

More Posts Twitter Post navigation EXTRA BAGGS: Don’t expect Giants to make reaction move to Pence injury, etc. Spring notes: Giants consider options to replace Pence, Petit is perfect again, etc. gemmatmorrow Hunter’s a special guy. That this happened at all sucks but I oddly don’t feel that worried about it because I know Hunter will battle back as fast as he can. On top of that, he’s a class act! Andre Castille I miss Morse already. Where is the power coming from? I trust ya Sabey. Kramerica How could anybody not love Hunter Pence? Just reading his transcript is inspiring and brings up my mood…and the guy just broke his arm. I for one am with The Oracle about getting Belt time in LF and Susac more time behind the plate to help improve the offense. Belt will look like a gold glover out there compared to Morse and this way his bat can always stay in the lineup, particularly when Posey plays 1B. If the Giants aren’t going to seek outside options, which they don’t really need to, then I think they should get Belt some time in LF. DrLefty I haven’t been this sad about an injury since Posey in 2011. I know that was much worse than this, but I feel like crying anyway. This time there’s no one to be mad at, at least–obviously the kid didn’t mean to hurt Pence and feels terrible about it. Cousins intentionally targeted Posey, and after he had obviously seriously injured him, said right after the game, “I feel great that I helped my team win.” Darkrose Hunter is the best. We’re so lucky that he’s a Giant. Mike Souza Hunter was born to be a GIANT. Just a cool dude… http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Since Laker Fan MS says I’m a butt kisser I will plant one on Punter Hence and say smooth sailing and great job reaching out to the Cubs pitcher. Hunter told Brandon Belt he’s happy it wasn’t his *dominant* hand. The Oracle I like the fact that Black, the Cubs’ pitcher, apologized. There’s not enough of that in baseball. The sport has a lot of pseudo tough guys, especially pitchers, who say nothing in similar circumstances. Good for him. Bumgarner, on the other hand, is an actual tough guy. Appalled7 This is a great interview, and Pence has exactly the right attitude. There have been studies done that actually show that mental attidute has a huge influence on physical health, and people who are upbeat and optimistic heal faster and are healthier over all. I am on record predicting he will be back at the very early end of the time frame. http://obsessivegiantscompulsive.blogspot.com/ obsessivegiantscompulsive Belt and Pagan. I plugged in the expected lineup with Pagan leading off and Pence in there, then compared it to Aoki leading off, Pagan 3rd, Belt 5th, using ZiPS and the projected Runs Scored for the lineup was basically the same, 4.01 vs. 4.05 with Pence. So very minimal difference, as we forget that Pagan has some power, Pence is 3rd slugging, Pagan 4th. That’s also because optimally, you want Aoki leading off, as he’s better up there than Pagan (higher OBP), and you don’t want one of your best hitters hitting 3rd (studies have shown that the common 2 outs situation facing that batter reduces the overall run value you can expect from that hitter), so you put Pagan 3rd and move Belt to a lower spot where his power delivers more runs, and better, push McGehee lower in the order. That would push the lineup to 4.10 RS, with Pence in the lineup. http://obsessivegiantscompulsive.blogspot.com/ obsessivegiantscompulsive Belt and Pagan.

YogiBarrister Is Hunter Pence’s locker room speech in Cincinnati going to be in Andrew’s new book. I just pre-ordered a copy on Amazon for the Bay Area Best Seller List when it’s released. I’ll buy another at my local book store to support Walnit Creek business. Hope they get it out by Opening Day. http://www.amazon.com/Giant-Splash-Bondsian-Parades-Thrilling/dp/1629370312/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425668929&sr=8-1&keywords=Giants+splash YogiBarrister Sorry if this reads like spam, I’m an old copywriter by trade. Neither Baggarly nor SJMN approved my message, and I have no connection with them. Bleacher Bob “I think it’s going to end up being a great blessing.” I think so too. Somebody gets a chance with the open roster spot. When Hunter comes back, the team gets a boost. Maybe he spends the time perfecting his proud warrior pose. channelclemente Scutaro going down seems to suggest such things happen. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Andres the Forever Giant.

When Brian Wilson went down early in 2012, it I proved the pen and added a year or two to my life. HaakAway You gain a Susac bat (positive yet untested) but you weaken 1B and LF (Belt’s only possible OF spot, right?). It is a game of Trade Offs. Why not root for Your Guy Maxwell to have a hot ST and get the chance in RF? Besides Blanco, I think he is the only proven MLB RF at Scotsdale. Meanwhile prepare for the Opposite of last year: Slow start with a strong rest of the way. Michael Scott You asked. The Giants could take lessons from me and from several of our regulars, as well. Keep’n It Real ***Off-Topic*** Quite the little twitter storm this morning, because Bob Fitzgerald (aka. Jaba the Fitz) criticized Greg Papa on the air for not watching the broadcast. Apparently Greg gave credit to Ros for saying something Bob said…so Jaba got upset and took a shot at Papa. Hmmm…Jaba goes behind Papa’s back (during negotiations) to land the Warriors TV gig. Papa is one of the best play-by-play guys out there and he doesn’t want to watch Jaba’s inferior work? Jaba calls Papa out on air and says he should do a better job of watching the broadcast over a simple mistake on a minor point? Ahmed Fareed (CSN) has already some to Papa’s defense and said Greg watches watches the game (and repeats stuff via DVR). It was also mentioned by someone else that Ros made the same comment that Jaba claims was his…in an interview with Livingston. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp “A remarkable thing happened last October, when the Giants staged their championship celebration in Kansas City. There were no more games to be played, no more meetings or consultations for Dave Righetti, no more fears of some horrific arm injury. Nothing but unbridled, childlike merriment. “I actually went out in the clubhouse with the guys, did all kinds of interviews,” Righetti said. “Boch handed me the trophy, and I’d never touched the other ones (from 2010 and ’12). It was kinda nice, being able to gush over the guys a little bit. I let it all out.” Seldom has anyone known such sweet release. http://tinyurl.com/qjd2x7j http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp I was watching right at that moment. Fitz’s head got enormous and his nostrils flared. The best I have heard Greg “in game” (with JB again) was the Sleepy Floyd is superman game. Fitz’s best work came when he introduced a Saber Kitten as Ginger More when her real name was Vanessa Angel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNfBUHt99dE http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp I was watching right at that moment.

My others here are Ishi, Blanco, Belt, Crawford, Adrianza, Perez, Petit, J.C.,Affeldt and Casilla. You guys can split the rest. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp I sure miss Ray from late night KGO http://youtu.be/IftHvVHTXHw 22′sSweetSwing This is the same kind of off year cr*p that happened in 2011 when I bought tickets in the preseason. Atleast he should be back by the time I get to go to a Thursday night game in late May. Grumble, grumble, grumble. I hope either Carbonell or Perez emerges to be solid competition for Blanco. I’m beyond fed up that the Giants won’t play Belt in LF and Posey at first. Michael Scott The best Giants LU without Pence: 1. Aoki 2. Belt 3..Pagan 4. Posey 5 McGehee 6.Blanco 7.Panik 8.Crawford Explanations for a nominal fee. channelclemente Samsgot to play. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp 34 years ago last night already. Geesh http://youtu.be/H9QEUfkRkZ0 Public_Service_forthe_Ignorati Wally Pipp said something similar. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp The odd things that “maddens” us, never even cross the minds of those in charge. Listening to the broadcast on radio or watching on TV doesn’t give credit to watching BB9 play first base in real life AT the park. Even his slap tags with him wearing the glove on the hand nearest the bag – give the staff a huge advantage. On crash bunt plays with only a man on first base, ONLY he can get that lead runner at second. On crash bunt plays with R1 and R2 – only BB9 can get the lead runner at third base. The destroyed hooking line drive down the RF line is sometimes snagged by BB9 before it leaves the infield. Buster is a below average first baseman who when playing there, makes up for a lot of his deficiencies by use of his moxy and athleticism in where to play the hitter. HaakAway Not surprised as I looked at him this AM. He looks like he can play good defense and has some speed on the bases. How good does he have to be in ST to make the team and get time in RF? Now I am wondering what “My Guy” means? I think of it as players that we think are valuable but get little respect here? Then My Guys are McGehee, Aoki, Crawford, Arias … probably some others I cannot come up with right now too. Foothills Ryan but do you miss Rey? Everybody loves Reymundo. HaakAway Good Old Time baseball knowledge … Always welcome to my ears. Foothills Ryan I think Sabes got my scouting report on Maxwell when Omaha came to town. Christian Colon is another name to keep in mind, albeit a common name as he was an early 1st rounder a few years ago from CSU Fullerton. Foothills Ryan Maxwell: probably just better than Perez. HaakAway RIght … it will just come down to a comparison like that. Foothills Ryan I’d pump brakes on Carbonell. He hasn’t played above high A and had a flat showing in the Arizona Fall League. Needs AA. 610nm There is a companion term, “our guys”. That is anyone left over after Footy lists his “my guys”. Sometimes a short list, Footy’s roster is way more than 40 guys. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp I do miss the stories that are associated with him and I loved Father Guido Sarducci’s Portuguese Water dogs that swam in McCovey Cove during early Pac Bell years. http://thebark.com/content/portuguese-water-dogs-play-ball Michael Scott I believe that Footsy started the ” my guy” deal and one of the “gals” followed suit. They pretty much claim everybody as one of theirs. In Feetsie’s case, it has very little to with talent- many of his guys work at Wendy’s now. In my case, they are players who I’ve championed. I have no idea what the criteria is for the lady. Foothills Ryan Baseball is underway & Dougie Fresh is on the air. Matt Duffy just connected ! It’s those extra 10# and sipping shakes with Hanley. Michael Scott Blanco is the 3 or 4 outfielder ( usually ends up as the 3rd) He has no competition for that spot. Foothills Ryan Michael Scott is one of my guys, and I don’t care if he’s a line cook at Wendy’s Bistro. Darkrose That amazing double play in game 7? Everyone talks about Panik and Crawford, as they should, but if Buster’s at 1B that play doesn’t get made. Buster doesn’t have the wingspan BB9 does, and that extra 4 inches of height helps him keep that size 15 flipper on the bag as he makes the catch. 22′sSweetSwing I said I HOPE, not think. 22′sSweetSwing Doesn’t competition make players better? That is why I want him to have some. He definitely hasn’t had much in the last few years thanks to the Giants inability to draft outfielders. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Super excellent Intel! 22′sSweetSwing 1.

Giants hitting instructor extraordinaire? Foothills Ryan Aoki may need a taster if Chef Scott is cooking team supper. He can’t be too thrilled that Aoki was given precedence over Blanco.

Foothills Ryan His nickname is “Stink” or “Stinky”. Made debut at 20 years of age last year. Were they thinking he’d be a Top 50 prospect and make a debut at such a young age? Public_Service_forthe_Ignorati …once Mr. Posey is finished with it. HaakAway I think “players who I’ve championed” is a good definition for “MyGuy”. Foots does need a Limit … He just has too much Positive Vibe going? I also think an added feature is that they are players somewhat Overlooked. For example, therefore, Panik does not qualify as 90% are champions for him. I know this is all subjective but the “My Guy” Guys/Gals have a point that I am trying to sharpen up. I do like to hack-away. Michael Scott I’m just saying how it is. Efrain most likely has to do with the fact they know more about baseball in general and the inner workings of their team than you do. Common sense will tell you that with Pence out and the offense missing some punch, keeping the rotation and pitching as tight as possible is the only way to stay in close games. Posey gives them that over anyone, the reason they don’t want to move him even though he may hit better as a 1B. They are blessed with a master game caller and know the move to another C for more than a few games a week could prove iffy at best. avwh That was a hilarious routine – maybe his best. Michael Scott As soon as Aoki was signed I was all for it. And I said then and since, Blanco will probably still get as much time as Aoki and Pagan. Matthew It was a rough night…they couldn’t figure out what to name him. “Pervasive” was one of their early thoughts. Like what happened to REM when they ran out of time and named their album “Out of Time”, they said to the clerk…”This is rough, Ned”…. The clerk misunderstood. The rest is odoriferous history http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Robert Bobby Evans about Hunter Pence https://audioboom.com/boos/2961423-bobby-evans-march-6-2015 Bleacher Bob Me too. Efrain even if the Giants would have drafted a stud outfielder in the past few years of Blanco’s time with the team, the chances of that draft pick providing “competition” are slim to none this early. Its not like a Mike Trout or Bryce Harper comes around all the time, and if that player existed we know the Giants wouldn’t be able to touch him since they would not know a talented OF prospect if he was standing in from of them. 22′sSweetSwing I hope you enjoy that finely tuned pitching staff because when they aren’t getting any offensive support it really is going to be the only part worth watching. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO8x8eoU3L4 http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTHpChltQzI Bleacher Bob I like to think this is Eli Whiteside’s fascination. Efrain i hear you, but Posey to LF and Buster to 1B hardly makes them the Murderers Row, get my drift. Therefore having the best C and defense out there will help keep them in games because they are not winning and slugfest (the team was never built to do that in the 1st place). HR are sexy but don’t know whey the fan base screams for something they have hardly seen?!!? Maybe for a month early last year, which was an anomaly. The team is built as it is and fans need to accept it. Only way it will change is if they get some power FA next year and draft and develop power bats, hacks like Duvall are not the answer and will never develop into front line players. Mac is still possible, but rest of farm looks bleak. channelclemente So lay it at Posey’s door. Hmm. Appalled7 Just got back into the house and able to turn on the audio. Seems some guys in orange and black are having themselves a day. Duffy got himself a long ball, eh? Good for hm! Michael Scott Thanks. avwh I was at that game: Sleepy had 27 points in the 4th quarter, nearly all of them layups. Appalled7 What is the actual score? Announcers keep saying 9-0; MLB app is showing 7-2 with Mejia giving up 2 runs. What gives? http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Arrival time delayed for #24 http://blog.sfgate.com/johnshea/2015/03/05/cracked-rib-keeping-willie-mays-from-spring-training/ Michael Scott Check out this from ESPN : (top performers 3/6/15) M. Duffy San Francisco Giants 4-4, 4 HR, 4 RBI, 4 R @ TEX | Top 5th A. Pagan San Francisco Giants 4-4, 4 RBI @ TEX | Top 5th B. Crawford San Francisco Giants 2-2, 2 3B, 4 RBI @ TEX | Top 5th avwh “I’m thinking of opening a law school next door. Got a minute?” avwh Hmm. So it SHOULD be at least 12-2 per ESPN, but my app shows 7-2 in the 4th. Brownie 9-0 Giants. One out in the top of the 6th with Ishikawa AB Brownie He’s messing with us Appalled7 Thanks. The app had Beltre and Fielder scoring in the 4th, but I see they’ve fixed it now. Wonder how that happened? Brownie Have no clue 22′sSweetSwing I get your drift and I don’t want HRs specifically, but I do want an offense that takes some pressure off of a pitching staff. But I suppose that is what Belt at first base does via the scoop. Good thing this should only last about a month of games, I mean how far behind could they get by then? avwh I got that; but I see my app was wrong, too… Michael Scott It’s 9 to 0. MLB.com just fixed it. I have no idea what ESPN was smoking. Atlas Aloha fellow GE’ers, from Surprise, AZ. 9-0 Gigantes. Thought we might see a spring training no-hitter but Rangers player #107 broke it up in the 6th, much to the delight of the Texas fans around us. Brownie ESPN blows Michael Scott Those weird numbers were from the ESPN site .Hope they haven’t changed it. http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/scoreboard http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Touching http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/03/go-behind-the-scenes-of-craig-sagers-emotional-return-to-television Brownie My bad MS. I thought you were messing with us. I’ll take those nos though Michael Scott Mother’s Day in Surprise, the daughters are 75. channelclemente Let us know your take on Crick, my friend. Brownie How hard was Krick throwing and secondary pitches? TIA Michael Scott Me? Messing with you guys? You must be thinking of another Michael Scott. Brownie LOL https://twitter.com/howardjohny Johny Howard Troll. He is currently holding the longest games played streak. #dumbass channelclemente Okert in for Crick. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Pavlovic on with Doug Greenwald ….(said he and AB may have been traded for a pizza and a player to be named later) http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Homerun Downtown Gary Brown Brownie Great for Brown. I’d really like to see him succeed. channelclemente Took him long on a 3-2 on pitch low and inside. Power zone? HaakAway Yes and how is Maxwell moving and swinging? Who looks like the best OF after Blanco? HaakAway Too cryptic for me … You making a trip there for Mothers’ Day? Today is like “Mothers Day”? The “daughters” are wearing Zito jerseys? Help me out here. Michael Scott Still a long shot. Brownie A very long shot imo http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp “A Boy named Joan” how do you do. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOHPuY88Ry4 Appalled7 Cute. And some of you were complaining he had no personality. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp HaHa + Alex got into some twitter gizmo with somebody when he was asked “why he was traded” – right after it happened … but has chilled some now … Michael Scott Just a joke about the average age for Surprise residents. As far as Mother’s Day, it was just a way to emphasize that. Had the same deal at my restaurant in Napa by the Silverado CC- 100 Moms came in, 97 came out. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp It’s not the wand, it’s the magician :>) HaakAway Okay … thanks. I have been to ST once … it seemed to give some of the local Retirees a place to go or even a job for a month at the parks. Everyone is in a good mood there it seems. HaakAway Love the “Ollie” reference. He came close for a while. http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp HaHa I use it for Daniel (Slusser) Brown at times….and of course “our” Ollie … http://m.padres.mlb.com/news/article/26555264/ Basketball at USF also had an Ollie also, Ollie johnson. Man could he jump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncrdv0jI2cU Appalled7 Nevermind – only half listening. Foothills Ryan you and Peter don’t see eye to eye. Foothills Ryan what’d he do this time? Michael Scott Hey. you live until 90+ you should be in a good mood Appalled7 LOL Matthew ESPN proves it is possible to smoke and blow at the same time SurfCity Now for the big question. Will Pence’s injury get more social media play than the scooter incident? paul in p.v. “Everybody loves Hunter Pence.” 22′sSweetSwing I hope I can find that! avwh What’s not to love? What a great attitude. No WONDER he’s “the preacher” and an inspirational leader in the clubhouse & dugout. channelclemente Well, maybe not a ‘big question’. HaakAway Ollie “Downtown” Brown … The Next WIllie Mays … #8 of 28 … now we know there is no Next Willie Mays (BB25 could have come the closest if he stayed clean) Anti-Lasorda Let me correct you, the correct assessment is NO SHOT….. channelclemente Bochy uttered the words Blanco, Perez, right field, and platoon in the same sentence post game. We’ll see. SurfCity Double check your sarcasm detector to see if it’s operational Michael Scott How can you like a guy who has absolutely no vices? Here’s an idea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_0xAbFAIbM http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp After the diagnosed break Hunter uttered….”It is only when you see a mosquito landing on your testicles that you realize that there is always a way to solve problems without violence.” http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Rags: Strong, silent and successful! The last thing Righetti wants to hear is a list of his accomplishments. Asked about the Giants’ run of exceptional pitching, he’ll immediately point to manager Bruce Bochy, trusted bullpen coach Mark Gardner and catcher Buster Posey. Mention that the Giants have had only one pitcher (Brian Wilson) require Tommy John surgery at the big-level under his stewardship, and he’ll remind you that Joe Nathan, Jesse Foppert and Noah Lowry had serious arm problems at the lower levels. “Those are guys I don’t forget,” he said. http://tinyurl.com/qjd2x7j paul in p.v. Gracias, Atlas! ) http://youtu.be/L-PwJe7ldTI ClutchUp Francona “lost” his red scooter to an overzealous CLEV employee who *borrowed* it to do a commercial. There are knuckleheads everywhere. channelclemente From piety central, sarcasm…the loaves and fishes are marching n step. Efrain if the Dodgers shot out of a cannon it could be far back, but last season taught us there are a few peaks and valleys in any season. Efrain you have google, there are plenty of site to check without having a cow over it Michael Scott Keeping in mind that this means *very* little: *Min 6 AB* Early speed out of the gate: Ishi, Parker, Duffy, Mcgeeeegee, Duvall Right off the early leaders: Blanco, Perez, Brown Need to Giddy up : Adrianza, Susac, Crawdad, Still a maiden: Maxwell Foothills Ryan What’s Jose Cruz Jr. up to these days? Foothills Ryan You mean he hasn’t lost his maidenhead? -That’s our guy!! channelclemente MLBPA employee? Michael Scott Even though I like Maxwell for some pop off the bench; of the OF prospects other than Mac, Parker would the guy with the most upside. Appalled7 Best part about today’s game? All those hits got us extra pumped up for tomorrow’s TELEVISED game! Brownie probably not Vegas Giants Fan* I talked about this (Parker – upside) last season. At San Jose he suffered a sever beaning by a left handed pitcher. the following season Parker was lost facing lefty’s. (Steve Decker said he had no chance against them) He hit 18 HR’s with 55 RBI’s that year. (2013) Against lefty’s he hit 1 Hr and had 8 RBI’s. Last year (during the season) Decker changed his stance, moving him closer to the plate and got him out of a crouch he had developed. It took some time but once he started to figure things out he started to make good progress. His numbers for July; .319/5/16 – .398/.560/.958 (this was about the time he got his call up/call down) He does everything well. He’s an excellent fielder that can play all three outfield positions, he has a strong arm. He has above average speed and can hit for power. (.185 ISO last year – .209 vs. RHP) Decker said the Giants know that he will strike out, but because he does everything else well their willing to deal with it. (they will work to with him to make this area of his game better) He was the Giants 2nd round pick out of The university of Virginia in 2010. With Pence’s injury maybe Parker will get a closer look this spring. This the kid that I’m looking forward to seeing in a Giants uniform come April. I believe I said he was my sleeper pick before Spring Training started. Go Giants. Vegas Giants Fan* I use CBSSports.com to check out the scores. They don’t have the rinky dink box scores that espn does. Vegas Giants Fan* Keep an eye on Tyler Horan at Richmond this year. Drafted in the 8th round in 2013 out of Virgina Tech. Tied the Cape Cod League record for HR’s in a season. Was one of the top outfielders in the ACC. Last year he hit 15 HR’s in 101 games at Augusta. (second toughest ballpark to hit HR’s in the minors – Baseball America) He was promoted to San Jose during the season. He hit 10 HR’s in 27 games for the S.J. Giants. He was sent to Richmond to play for the Flying Squirrels in their playoffs. If he can keep up his production in the very tough Eastern League – AA he could turn himself into a top prospect for the Giants. (remember, I said if.) Who knew who Matt Duffy was two years ago? (besides me – only because I study the Giants farm system) It will be nice for Mac Williamson to have some competition at AA. Anyway, it’s nice to have hope. Go Giants. Vegas Giants Fan* The “My Guy” comes from being the first to bring up the positives of a minor league player before anyone else does. Take Clayton Blackburn for instance. I first wrote about him after his excellent season in the Arizona Rookie League. I told everyone to keep an eye on this kid. The following season he out pitched Kyle Crick at Augusta as a 19 year old. Ever since then certain posters have looked to “claim” a young minor league player as “Their Guy.” I usually pick two player per season for everyone to keep track of. Last year was the first time I posted before the season a couple of players to watch. (Mitch Delfino and pitcher Pat Young) I was 1 for 2. Some of “my guys” have been Blackburn, Cody Hall, Edwin Escobar, Matt Duffy, Jeff Arnold, Tyler Rogers. Last year Lefty asked my what I knew about Tyler Horan. I did some research and posted my findings for her. See liked what she read so she claimed him. That’s about how it works. One player I claimed was Christian Arroyo. Almost everyone on this blog was against his selection by the Giants, mostly because they listened to the talking heads. It kind of pi$$ed me off. So I made a point of posting his results on a daily basis on the Minor League Report. (in the Arizona Rookie League) He started out slow but ended up winning the MVP of the league. Because I stuck with him when no one else would I felt it was only right that he should be one of “my guys.” If you want to be part of the club just follow the minor league’s and if you see someone you like all you have to do is say that your player is your guy. Matt Duffy was the first one of “my guys” to make it to the big show. (he was the first one of anyone’s “guys” to make it to the Majors – bragging rights) It’s fun, and you can always point out to the rest of us someone you belief is worth watching. Sorry about the long post. I’m so, so tired. Take care. Go Giants. Vegas Giants Fan* Only you and I picked Ishikawa as the guy the Giants should call up. We both know how that worked out. HaakAway Thanks VGF … I re-posted it on Saturday AM so more would see it and know the history. I am sure the GE Crowd will have their tweaks to make. Michael Scott Hey, I’m not claiming him. I just think he’s a good looking kid with a chance due to an unfortunate injury to the pantie Captain. Michael Scott True, it was just you and I. Brownie I stay away from ESPN as much as possible Vegas Giants Fan* “Call of the Year.” Vegas Giants Fan* I’m not either. I just want to see what he can do.
