The appointment can be made at any level of seniority. Candidates with research interests in any specific sub-discipline within dynamic meteorology, including dynamics of severe weather/extreme events and meteorology of air quality, are encouraged to apply. Those candidates with a strong background in integrating theory and observations of meteorological phenomena on spatial scales ranging from mesoscale to synoptic would help satisfy a critical teaching and research need. The UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, is a vibrant and collaborative department whose faculty in atmospheric and ocean dynamics have long-standing strengths in the theory and modeling of large-scale circulations, moist convective processes, the general circulation, climate dynamics and the application of modem applied mathematics to problems in atmospheric and oceanic sciences. The ability of applicants to profit from, complement, and further contribute to these traditions will also be a consideration in their evaluation. The successful applicant must hold a Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree at the time of appointment and will be expected to contribute to the teaching mission of the department, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. He or she will also be expected to lead or develop a first rate program of research in dynamic meteorology in which context graduate and post-graduate scholars are actively recruited, supported, and mentored. Salary will be commensurate with education and experience. The target start date is on or after July 1, 2014. Please submit your online application to the Search Committee for faculty position in Dynamic Meteorology at https://recruit.apo.ucla.edu/apply/JPF00102  (tracking #0965- 1314-0 1). Please include: (i) a statement of teaching and research interests; (ii) curriculum vitae; (iii) a list of 3-5 individuals who are familiar with your work and can serve as a reference. Applications received prior to December 3, 2013 will receive full consideration. Please note that the on-line application website may close without notice at any time after January 31, 2014.
