Curriculum Studies, EdD  Early Childhood Education, EdD  Educational Leadership, EdD  For these programs, successful applicants:  Are willing and able to make the necessary commitment of time to the program.  Are likely to be successful in a challenging doctoral program.  Welcome the opportunity to interact with university faculty, peers, and colleagues in a search for effective answers to troubling problems in education. The admission process reflects and enacts the principles and values of the program regarding engagement, reflection, the exercise of agency, working for change, and a commitment to professional development and learning. To do this, it includes the following components:  Register for an information session.​ Potential applicants are strongly encouraged to attend an information session as part of the application process. This session covers the philosophical framework of the program, its values, and its expectations. Other activities to help potential applicants to make an informed decision about applying include dialogue with current students and faculty.  A personal statement (approximately 3 pages) in which the applicant discusses why he or she is interested in further study and articulates an issue or problem of interest or concern. A writing sample, preferably a course paper from the applicant's master's program. Alternatively, applicants can write a short (3-5 pages​) academic response to readings provided (upon request) by the doctoral program.  A conversational interview with two or three faculty which will provide an opportunity for candidates to become familiar with the program and the faculty, as well as an opportunity for faculty members to get to know prospective candidates. Applicants living outside of the Chicago area will engage in an appropriate, reciprocal substitute for this dialogue.  Three letters of recommendation, at least two of which should be from faculty in the applicant's master's program. Guidelines for Recommendations  Official transcripts from all undergraduate and graduate institutions attended. Transcripts should show completion of a master's degree from an accredited institution and a grade point average of a 3.0 or above on a 4.0 scale. Resume or curriculum vitae. Applicants must provide evidence of having experience in an educational role and solid demonstration of leadership or leadership ability. A completed College of Education graduate application and $40 application fee GRE scores are required, although they are not a major influence in admission decisions. We believe that they do not necessarily determine success in doctoral programs, but they help to gain a holistic view of the applicant. Guidelines for Recommendations The College of Education does not provide a recommendation form. The format and structure is left to the discretion of the recommender within the parameters discussed below. The only requirement is that the recommender provides contact information (i.e., address, phone, e-mail, and signature) with the recommendation.  Recommendations should be frank and detailed and should indicate how long and under what circumstances the recommender has known the applicant (e.g., student, assistant, advisee, employee, personal, etc.). A recommendation is most helpful when it provides specific information concerning the applicant's: Intelligence and independence of thought  Special interests and motivations  Personal qualities which may distinguish this applicant from other applicants  Overall promise  Performance related to her or his suitability for graduate study beyond that which is available on college transcripts and employment records  Performance related to his or her ability to work effectively in urban, multicultural environments  Performance related to her or his professionalism and appreciation of life-long learning Information For International Students Learn more about graduate admission information for international students.  Graduate Admission Office All application materials, including the $40 application fee, should be mailed to: DePaul University  College of Education  Office of Graduate Admission  2400 N.
