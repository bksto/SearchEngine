Whether learning or leading, UC Davis students are at the core of campus sustainability efforts. The Bike Barn, Student Farm and the Unitrans bus system are just a few of the innovative campus services founded by students, or created in close coordination with student leaders decades ago. Project Compost and the Salad Bowl Garden are two more recent, student-led sustainability efforts. These projects and services enrich campus life and make daily operations more environmentally friendly. The Baggins End and Tri-Cooperatives student housing communities offer hands-on sustainable living opportunities to students. The next generation of sustainable living and learning housing is being planned by the Sustainable Living/Learning Taskforce. Learning and innovating But UC Davis students are not only taking the lead and providing the elbow grease — they are also learning from some of the nation's foremost academic leaders in sustainable agriculture, transportation, energy efficiency and related fields. Pursuing a major or taking a course that focuses on how to manage resources for environmental, economic and social equity prepares students to be future innovators. Powering the movement Student workers, interns and volunteers also help power much of the campus's sustainability-focused systems, from recycling to student housing programs. Working for sustainable campus operations or joining a related student group can provide valuable experience for future professional endeavors.
