TIMptations is run by the Teresi and Chiala families in Morgan Hill, California. As fifth- and third-generation family farmers, respectively, both families are steeped in the traditions of sustainable agriculture and have deep roots in Santa Clara County. They enjoy partnering with local businesses to offer vegetable boxes which TIMptations founder, Tim Chiala, feels creates links that are essential to the continued viability of family farms in the Bay Area and beyond. Click here to learn more and sign up! Farm to Fork Farm to Fork is a companywide initiative to buy locally, formalized in 1999. Our first choice is to purchase seasonal ingredients from small, owner-operated farms and ranches within a 150-mile radius of your café. Food grown locally is fresher, better tasting, and often has greater nutritional value. Our commitment to local food is about preserving biodiversity, protecting open space, supporting family farmers, and keeping money invested in your community. Bon Appétit aims to spend at least 20 cents of every dollar with our network of over a thousand Farm to Fork suppliers. By doing so, we aim to strengthen our regional food systems so that everyone in our communities can eat well not just today, but for the future. » Learn more about your local farmers Social Tweets by @bamco Catering by Bon Appétit Planning a meeting or event?
