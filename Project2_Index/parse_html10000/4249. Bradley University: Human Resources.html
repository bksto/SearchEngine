Bradley University is the ideal size for living and learning. As a private, comprehensive university of about 5,100 undergraduate and 900 graduate students, Bradley provides a broad choice of academic and pre-professional programs with more than 90 programs of study in five colleges: the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; College of Education and Health Sciences; College of Engineering and Technology; Foster College of Business Administration; Henry Pindell Slane College of Communications and Fine Arts, and the graduate school. At the same time, classes are small-- the average class size is 24 students and the student to faculty ratio is 14:1. Bradley's nearly 300 full-time faculty are both active researchers and committed teachers providing personalized attention in learning and academic advising. And all courses are taught by professors, not graduate assistants. Bradley University is committed to cultural diversity, and is striving to maintain and enrich its cultural, racial, and ethnic communities. It is expected that successful candidates share in this commitment. Bradley is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
