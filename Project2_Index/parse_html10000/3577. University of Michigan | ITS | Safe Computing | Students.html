They are there to help you control who sees what you post and manage your online experience in a positive way. When you're logged into Facebook, for example, look in the Settings menu (indicated by a gear icon) for privacy settings, or the Privacy Shortcuts menu (indicated by a closed padlock). Familiarize yourself with the privacy settings for whatever social networks you use. Once posted, always posted: Protect your reputation on social networks. Recent research found that 70% of job recruiters rejected candidates based on information they found online. Your online reputation can be a good thing: Recent research also found that recruiters respond to a strong, positive personal brand online. So show your smarts, thoughtfulness, and mastery of the environment. Protect Yourself Know and manage who sees your personal information: Use tools to manage the information you share with friends in different groups or even have multiple online pages. If you're trying to create a public persona as a blogger or expert, create an open profile or a "fan" page that encourages broad participation and limits personal information. Use your personal profile to keep your real friends (the ones you know and trust) more synched up with your daily life. Be honest if you're uncomfortable: If a friend posts something about you that makes you uncomfortable or you think is inappropriate, let them know. Likewise, stay open-minded if a friend approaches you because something you've posted makes him or her uncomfortable. People have different tolerances for how much the world knows about them -- respect those differences. Post only about others as you would have them post about you. Know what action to take: If someone is harassing or threatening you, remove them from your friends list, block them, and report them to the site administrator.
