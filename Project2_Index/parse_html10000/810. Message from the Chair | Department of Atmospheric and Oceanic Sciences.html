We could not accomplish our important work without you—our alumni and friends—who are our community partners in excellence. I encourage you to take a moment to make a year-end gift to the department; it will be a worthwhile investment. Your gift will make a significant and immediate impact on the department’s success by providing vital resources and allowing us to address our most pressing needs. Your donation might even be eligible to be matched by your employer, thus doubling its impact; please check the Gift Options section of our webpage. Since becoming chair in July 2010, I have been impressed by the department’s continued success even in these most challenging economic times. Co-ranked #1 in the nation in the most recent data-based rankings conducted by the National Research Council, the UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences fosters innovative research and teaching in new and interdisciplinary approaches while maintaining a strong commitment to traditional areas of study. The department continues to welcome the best and brightest scholars from across the country and all over the world. We have 17 ladder faculty (including joint appointments) as well as three Distinguished Research Faculty/Emeriti, one new faculty member arriving July 2013, and a recently approved search for a new faculty member in oceanography. Additionally, we have seven adjunct faculty, one lecturer, 23 researchers, three project scientists, 15 postdoctoral scholars, and an incoming graduate student cohort of 10 this academic year. This year, several faculty have garnered special awards worth noting. Rob Fovell has been elected Fellow of the American Meteorological Society and awarded the 2012 American Meteorological Society (AMS) Teaching Excellence Award. Michael Ghil was awarded the 2012 Alfred Wegener Medal and given honorary membership in the European Geosciences Union (EGU). Kuo-Nan Liou is the recipient of the 2012 Quadrennial Gold Medal Award given by the International Radiation Commission (IRC). I felt honored in being named Fellow by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Affiliated Researcher Yuri Shprits (Earth & Space Sciences) was a recipient of a Presidential Early Career Award. Postdoctoral Scholar Lunjin Chen was chosen as recipient of the 2012 AGU Fred Scarf Award, established to recognize an outstanding dissertation that contributes directly to the solar-planetary science. Our graduate student awards include prestigious NASA Fellowships. Our graduate alumni are serving as project leaders with the NASA DEVELOP National Program at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and are working with the California Department of Fish and Game and the National Weather Service. Our recent undergraduates have headed off to start their careers in prestigious graduate programs like Princeton, and into private industry with local groups such as SWAPE ("Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise") in Santa Monica. Our department website and Facebook page provide more highlights. We are grateful for your generous support, which enables us to maintain our standing as a leader in the field at one of the most prestigious public research universities in the world. I extend my best wishes for the New Year, and I hope to see you at one of our upcoming events. Sincerely, J.
