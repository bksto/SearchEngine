Actuaries deal with tangible problems rather than theoretical ones; they must be curious, have sound judgment, and be able to think logically and creatively. WPI’s Actuarial Sciences program, which applies theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, helps ready students for positions, including a wide range of insurance companies, consulting firms, and government agencies. WPI’s unique project-based education gives actuarial sciences students a head start on their careers by introducing fundamentals in business and economics, as well as preparing them for the first two Society of Actuaries (SoA) examinations. The curriculum for actuarial sciences students includes specialized mathematics, as well as introductory business and economics courses. In addition to their work on the WPI campus, actuarial students have Interactive and Major Qualifying Projects, which give real-world experience in the actuarial field by having them involved in solving problems faced by professional actuaries. Projects are regularly completed in collaboration with insurance companies, and have in the past been sponsored by Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, John Hancock Mutual Insurance, Premier Insurance, and Travelers Property Casualty.   See Also Society of Actuaries Casual Actuarial Society Undergraduate Course Catalog Career Outlook (for Mathematical Sciences) Academics Mathematical Sciences About the Department Undergraduate Programs Actuarial Sciences Mathematical Sciences Combined BS/MS Program Courses Degree Requirements Graduate Programs K-12 Outreach Programs Faculty & Staff Research News & Events Student Projects Student Resources Career Outlook Related Sites Open Positions Admissions Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics Career Development Center Data Science Facebook Find Us on Facebook Contact Department of Mathematical Sciences Stratton Hall 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5241 Fax: +1-508-831-5824 ma-questions@wpi.edu Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
