For more than 100 years, UC Davis has focused on its mission of teaching, research, and service, and it has inspired students and faculty to address many of society's most critical problems. My wife Renee and I have a long relationship with UC Davis dating back to when we first met as undergraduate students in our freshman dorm. We have been enthusiastic observers and supporters as the university has grown and evolved during the past 40 years, and we were pleased when both of our daughters chose to attend UC Davis. We feel privileged to have obtained a UC Davis education and we are proud to be Aggies. As chair of the UC Davis Foundation Board of Trustees, I am honored to lead a distinguished group of volunteers who are committed to supporting Chancellor Linda Katehi, UC Davis faculty, staff, students, and other constituents in carrying out UC Davis’ Vision of Excellence. The trustees and I know that supporters like you are the key to fulfilling this vision, and we are deeply grateful for your generosity. Philanthropic support of UC Davis is so important today as the state continues to reduce its share of the funding of the university. Today the state provides less than 10 percent of UC Davis’ budget, which is down from about 50 percent when I was a student. During my career as an investor in growing companies, I learned that investing in great people leads to great results. At UC Davis, Renee and I have met extraordinary and committed people in the College of Engineering, Graduate School of Management, School of Nursing, Athletics, the Center for Mind and Brain, and Student Services working on real projects, and we feel fortunate to have been able to help support their important work that will benefit all of us. It is a real treat to see our investments at UC Davis bear fruit, and we are thankful for the opportunity to invest in these exciting projects.   Today’s UC Davis students are hard-working and come with impressive credentials. In 2013 the UC Davis Foundation, under the leadership of Chair Bruce Edwards, passed the hat among its members and raised $1 million for student scholarships. Through the matching fund and the generosity of other donors, this amount was leveraged to raise a total of $4 million and create 40 student scholarships that are awarded annually. It has been heartening to meet these worthy recipients and see firsthand how philanthropic support has allowed these students to pursue their dreams. The success of the university’s first-ever comprehensive fundraising campaign, which was completed in May 2014 and which raised more than $1.1 billion from nearly 110,000 donors, has set the stage for what’s next. Chancellor Katehi is doing an extraordinary job leading the university and leveraging the campaign’s momentum to change lives on a global scale, and with your support, UC Davis can do even more. As a top 10 public research university committed to improving the quality of life for everyone, UC Davis is working to solve the world’s most pressing challenges and educating the next generation of leaders. There are so many interesting things going on at UC Davis and I encourage you to find the best way to get involved. I invite you to explore this website to learn how you can pursue your interests by supporting UC Davis.
