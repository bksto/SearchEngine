INTRODUCTION Watch segment 1 | 8:38 View Segment 1 Slides (download or view PDF)   SLIDE 1: The whirlwind of activity and ritual-like aspects that mark the beginning of the school year are matched with equal intensity and a frenzied pace toward the end of the academic year. We are a constant state of doing – no matter the time of year. Yet, we manage through our schedules, consumed with our priorities and deadlines, to come to this point, that is, the end of one academic year and the beginning of a new one. The whirlwind of activity and ritual-like aspects that mark the beginning of the school year are matched with equal intensity and a frenzied pace toward the end of the academic year. We are a constant state of doing – no matter the time of year. Yet, we manage through our schedules, consumed with our priorities and deadlines, to come to this point, that is, the end of one academic year and the beginning of a new one. As each new academic year begins, I am filled with both a sense of gratitude for the past and anticipation for what lies ahead. I am reminded of the many things to be thankful for and the opportunities yet to be seized. SLIDE 2: In this address I am trying an experiment, something our faculty and students do every day in search of the best learning and sharing they “flip” the classroom. You and I will try this in 9 video segments that you can watch or listen to at your leisure, after which we will meet in public sessions for a conversation about the content. I hope you’ll critique and respond to what I’ve said or point out the gaps. I will explore the current status of our University: how and why we have restructured organizationally this year, what new leaders we may recruit, some highlights of our faculty and student successes, our responses to contemporary issues in higher education, the financial state of the University, our collective vision for the future of the University, and progress on our comprehensive philanthropic campaign. Finally, to what end do we do all this together? It’s toward keeping an eye on quality. We are becoming a “hot” university, one that is on the move upward. I hope to convince you to “buy stock” in the University of Redlands. So let’s get started with organizational restructuring, all for the sake of a stronger foundation. ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING – STRENGTHENING OUR FOUNDATION To be certain, the 2013-14 academic year tested our resiliency and adaptability. A mark of a great organization is how it flexes to address a changing environment. SLIDE 3: In the first half of this year, the President’s Cabinet saw changes and transformations – some temporary, and some permanent. As a result of resignations, we had three vacant positions, the Vice President for Marketing & Strategic Communications, the Dean of the School of Education, and the Dean of the School of Business. And those followed upon the departure of the Executive Vice President, a position that we did not refill. SLIDE 4: Nevertheless, we have adapted to the changes quickly and have successfully implemented succession and reorganization plans, as demonstrated by Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Kathy Ogren’s leadership in a difficult, sudden transition to Acting Provost following David Fite’s unexpected medical emergency. Kathy’s partnership with Vice President for Finance and Administration Cory Nomura in leading the IT organization is another example of our fortitude. Associate Provost Ed Wingenbach and Professor and Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Fred Rabinowitz were instrumental in our ability to maintain operations in both the Provost’s and Deans’ Offices and to move forward with major initiatives during David’s recovery. SLIDE 5: Dedicated employees immediately helped us cope with changing operational realities in Information technology Services (ITS). SLIDE 6: For example, as the outgoing Director of the Redlands Institute, Jordan Henk sought new ways to serve the University, including project management directed at improved ITS operations and campus planning. Jordan joined four IT leaders to re-organize operations and ITS service. Steve Garcia, Terry Reed, Shariq Ahmed, and Kimberly Perna all assumed additional responsibilities and created a team-based leadership process, under the supervision of Kathy Ogren and Cory Nomura. In May, consultant Marty Ringle, Chief Information Officer at Reed College and a nationally well-known expert on education and technology, confirmed that our ITS team could sustain us in transition and effectively work together strategically to align ITS with the University mission. Adapting to unexpected IT service changes has actually produced enhanced outreach to the campus, plans for better coordinated IT and data governance, more effective communication, a focus on user services, and has effectively organized project and budget management. SLIDE 7: The current plan is to evaluate the Chief Information Officer position for a search. We’ll seek a position in alignment with our goals: to enhance ITS in service of teaching and learning communities; identify the strengths of our current ITS services and structure; overcome our limitations; and to re-envision ITS as a true academic service unit in support of our mission. SLIDE 8: This past April, Marketing and Strategic Communications underwent a formal review process to evaluate the organization’s structure, results, and operations. The unit was centralized in 2009 following an external review by GolinHarris. SLIDE 9: This recent review was conducted at its five-year mark by a “Blue Ribbon Panel” comprised of four experienced marketing and communications professionals who brought proficiency to this exercise from a wide array of higher education institutions, some very similar to Redlands. The panel was tasked with reviewing all aspects of the unit to provide a fair depiction of the division, its outputs, goals, alignment to the University’s mission, relationship with other units, management of budget, and reporting of outcomes, strengths, and potential weaknesses. SLIDE 10: In the ensuing months, following the May 9, 2014 resignation of Associate Vice President Kimberli Munkres, the Marketing and Strategic Communications team has engaged in critical community engagement and rigorous process improvement under the guidance of interim supervisors Michelle Rogers, Chief of Staff and Liaison to the Board, and Kevin Dyerly, Vice President for Enrollment. Under Kevin and Michelle’s leadership, the team is working to evolve an organizational structure to better serve the University of Redlands community as well as our external audiences. As with the ITS transitions, we purposefully avoided hiring outside interim leaders, instead repurposing our own internal administrative leaders as resources. This is a distinct test of the quality of our Cabinet leaders and a conscious move to minimize administrative overhead. SLIDE 11: On August 19, I announced the renaming of the unit to University Communications to better reflect their activities and the needs of the University. I also shared a progress report that included updates about our current advertising campaigns and the creation of a new website and content strategy. Our immediate focus is on the recruitment of a new leader. On July 3rd, we posted a revised leadership position, and an active search is underway for a Chief Communications Officer (CCO). Serving as a member of the President’s Cabinet, and reporting directly to me, the CCO will be responsible for coalescing the University’s key messages, brand attributes, and core essence in University-wide alignment. Kevin Dyerly, Michelle Rogers, and Vice President for Advancement Anita West are chairing the search and selection of the CCO, with the goal of filling the position by the end of October. Considerable weight is being given to candidates with a proven track record in higher education. As I say, we are on a quest for quality. In the next segment, I’ll discuss recent appointments and upcoming searches.    Watch segment 2 | 13:27 View Segment 2 Slides (download or view PDF) SLIDE 1: In a surprising development, in the first half of the year, two of our deanships turned over. SLIDE 2: On April 30, we appointed Associate Dean Keith Roberts as the Acting Dean of the School of Business and then as the Interim Dean on May 30th following Stuart Noble-Goodman’s resignation. In this role Keith will also oversee the School of Continuing Studies. Keith’s leadership in a sudden transition to acting Dean has been an example of his leadership and commitment to the success of the school. Keith quickly moved to appoint an interim associate dean. Marcus Castro, Adjunct Liaison at our Rancho Cucamonga campus, will serve in this position until the search for a new dean ends. SLIDE 3: In July we welcomed Dr. Andrew Wall as the new Robert A. and Mildred Peronia Naslund Endowed Dean’s Chair for the School of Education. Previously, Andrew served as the Associate Professor and Chair of the Educational Leadership Program and the Co-Interim Director of the Warner Center for Professional Development and Educational Reform at the Margaret Warner Graduate School of Education and Human Development at the University of Rochester. SLIDE 4: Andrew’s research in the areas of learning outcomes, college student health and learning, state educational finance, and public trust in education will be instrumental in his goals to strengthen relationships with local school districts and to partner with organizations for educational solutions benefiting not just Redlands but Southern California. SLIDE 5: I am pleased to report that we are in the final stages of hiring our first internal general counsel. For its entire history the University has been relying upon an external general counsel but also on administrators in each of the internal divisions to identify the legal issues and matters in which the University should invest, and to make recommendations to senior management about courses of action. Initiation of such requests is thus dependent upon the ability of administrators with varying responsibilities to recognize the nature and seriousness of the need for legal advice. This process is not only more expensive but itself carries greater inherent risks of non-recognition or erroneous assessment of actual needs, particularly with respect to newer or unfamiliar areas of legal exposure. SLIDE 6: While this is a change from outsourcing to insourcing for us, there is no impact on our budget, as we will fund the position by using monies currently spent on using external counsel for all of our legal needs. An in-house general counsel has become fairly common among colleges and universities of our size and complexity, and even for smaller places. Examples include Claremont McKenna, Occidental, Chapman, Santa Clara, University of San Diego, Pepperdine, Azusa Pacific, Cal Baptist, Lewis & Clark, Seattle University, and Willamette. SLIDE 7: I am also pleased to announce that for the first time in our history the University of Redlands will be hosting and mentoring an American Council on Education (ACE) Fellow for the academic year 2014-15. SLIDE 8: The ACE Fellows Program combines retreats, interactive learning opportunities, campus visits, and placement at another higher educational institution to condense years of on-the-job experience and skills development into a single semester or year. The fellows are included as observers in the highest level of decision-making while participating in administrative activities at their host institutions. The entire ACE Fellows Program is designed to strengthen institutional capacity and build leadership in American higher education by identifying and preparing promising senior faculty and administrators for responsible positions in college and university administration. SLIDE 9: Steven Bachrach, the Dr. D. R. Semmes Distinguished Professor of Chemistry and Assistant Vice-President for Special Projects at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas joined us as a Fellow on September 2nd. Steven’s research interests are in computational organic chemistry, where he has published over 120 articles and is the author of the monograph Computational Organic Chemistry. Steven has held various academic positions including co-chair of the Science and Engineering Facility Planning Committee (2008-current), vice-chair Faculty Senate (2002-2004), and member of the Commission for Tenure and Promotion (2005-2007). As an ACE Fellow, Steven will observe and work closely with me and my Cabinet, be an active participant in working with senior administrators observing our institutional leadership, and be a contributor in his own right on identifying ways to address the changing landscape and challenges of higher education. SLIDE 10: I have great confidence in the abilities of those we have selected to lead our campus, whether in the interim or on a permanent basis. These periods of transition are a normal – and necessary – part of change and can only serve to strengthen leadership in our different schools and in my Cabinet. Once you get to know our newest colleagues/leaders as they arrive on campus, I trust you will will see these changes as a distinctive quality move. In addition to personnel changes, we continue to seek ways to increase efficiencies, reduce administrative overlap, provide enhanced services, and better align our resources. SLIDE 11: One of the fastest changing areas in the world of universities is that of Career Services and Professional Development. With that in mind, when our director resigned in January we took the opportunity to look carefully at the services needed for the future success of all students across the University, including the Schools of Business and Education. A search committee composed of faculty and students from the schools and the college, co-chaired by the Dean of the College, Kathy Ogren and the Dean of Student Life, Char Burgess, selected Erik Larsen as the new Director of Career Services and Professional Development. Erik most recently served as the Director for the Center for Student Professional Development at Rice University in Houston, Texas. He comes to this position with a strong record of assessing best practices, developing strategies, implementing successful programs, and evaluating outcomes. SLIDE 12: On November 11, 2013, we announced the combination of the offices of Student Accounts and Financial Aid into one new department, Student Financial Services. This move created a one-stop shop with a “front office” and a “back office” to best serve the needs of students and constituents by streamlining all operations. The front office is located in Willis Center and is where current students, parents, and prospective students will visit for all questions related to applying for financial aid, payment options, and billing. All behind the scenes processing now happens in the back office, which is located in the Administration Building. We also implemented online billing and payment in November 2013. SLIDE 13: In another efficiency and cost-savings move, the Schools of Business and Education are now serviced by a single, school-neutral Adult & Professional Education Enrollment Team established in May of 2014. That team offers cross-trained staff who can serve any prospective student. The centralization of service has produced savings by building a team that will be able to absorb anticipated enrollment growth (from 1,300 students to as many as 1,450 students by 2015-16). Supporting both of the University’s professional schools and eight regional locations throughout Southern California, this team serves the fastest growing population of students in the US, namely “post-traditional” students, adult learners, and graduate students. Looking forward, this school-neutral model could enable future piloting and delivery of additional adult programs at any regional campus without having to first hire additional staff. SLIDE 14: At the start of this academic year, we announced a new direction in our spatial studies programs, marked by the creation of the Center for Spatial Studies and the closing of the Redlands Institute. SLIDE 15: Since 2000, the Redlands Institute has served as a research and consulting resource for faculty and staff, and for prestigious public and private partners, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of Defense, Environmental Protection Agency, State of California agencies, and local government and nonprofit organizations. The Redlands Institute has provided significant value to the University, securing sponsored research funding, contributing to scholarship, and raising the University’s visibility with local, state, and national partners. In closing the Redlands Institute, we achieved significant short- and long-term cost reductions concurrent with huge anticipated reductions in revenue from sponsored research. This resulted in ongoing budget savings of $608,000 and net budget savings of $409,000 for the 2014-15 year. The closure was an unhappy “after quake” following the end of Congressional appropriation funding. SLIDE 16: The new Center for Spatial Studies brings together staff members and administrators who were already employed at the University of Redlands, but now are efficiently organized into a single cohesive, focused unit. The Center will provide the level of support needed by our faculty and students in their work in spatial curriculum and research in academic programs across the University. Among these programs are the MS-GIS Program, the GIS Emphasis in the MBA Program, the Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis, and the new minor in Spatial Studies, which generate significant enrollments and revenue for the University. Building on our groundbreaking successes over the past twenty years, the creation of a new center represents an important step in the evolution of spatial studies at the University of Redlands, moving us to an even higher level of excellence in this domain. SLIDE 17: The Administration supported the efforts of faculty leadership to review and revise faculty governance on the institutional level, building upon the successful revision of the Faculty Constitution approved by the Board of Trustees in fall 2012 and the report and recommendations of the University’s Western Association of Schools & College (WASC) Self-Study Committee on Strengthening Collaborative Governance in spring 2013. The Personnel Policies Committee (PPC) was charged by the University Academic Assembly with researching alternative governance models and presenting recommendations for revising faculty governance on the institutional level. The PPC gathered information from peer institutions and on the history of faculty governance at the University of Redlands, reviewed research on faculty governance, conducted focus groups, and sponsored other discussions to help define general principles of shared governance and faculty governance. The PPC proposed a revision of the Faculty Constitution and By-Laws that was – I think it’s fair to say – resoundingly approved by the faculty in the spring 2014. SLIDE 18: The new governance structure implemented this fall 2014 includes a Faculty Senate and a new Budget and Planning Committee. Some of the main features of the new governance system are that: The Senate will act on behalf of the Academic Assembly, not replace it. The Academic Assembly continues to exist but will not have regularly scheduled monthly meetings. The Academic Assembly Chair, elected by the full faculty, serves as the non-voting President of the Senate. The Senate consists of 18 members elected by the full faculty divided among three separate committees: Committee on Academic Planning and Standards, Personnel Policies Committee, and the new Budget and Planning Committee. The new Budget and Planning Committee will consult directly and regularly with the administration on budgetary, financial, and planning issues. Other standing committees of the Academic Assembly will report to the Senate. In the next segment, I’ll review some of the highlights of the past year. HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR SUCCESS IN THE 2013-2014 ACADEMIC YEAR: FACULTY & PROGRAMS Watch Segment 3 | 14:12 View Segment 3 Slides (download or view PDF)    As I begin my third year, I am pleased with the progress we have made and reminded daily about what is special about the University of Redlands. SLIDE 1: The WASC re-accreditation letter praised the University of Redlands for our significant progress in addressing the issues identified in their 2003 Comprehensive Review and in their 2006 Special Visit, including establishing robust program learning outcomes, implementing a program review process, establishing an annual planning process, and improving student diversity. SLIDE 2: The Commission commended in particular the University’s: Strong program review process; In-depth examination of success metrics for various student populations; Aggressive steps to improve its financial condition, including reducing expenditures, implementing significant budget cuts, raising new revenues, and launching a fundraising campaign; Commitment to promoting student success for both traditional and post-traditional learners; The faculty’s clear ownership of and active engagement with program review and educational effectiveness; and Our model of personalized education. SLIDE 3: On May 15 in the Armacost Library, over 150 University of Redlands faculty, staff, administrators, and trustees came together for the second annual “Our House” celebration of our faculty and staff’s creative accomplishments. This event featured presentations and exhibitions by ten faculty members on their research, scholarship, and creative work. The annual Our House celebration and booklet highlight the importance and value of creative activity at the University of Redlands, showing the ways it inspires teaching, infuses the curriculum, transforms our students, contributes to disciplinary knowledge, addresses societal issues, and enriches culture. SLIDE 4: Our commitment to provide educational opportunities for our veterans remains strong. And in 2013, Redlands was named Best Regional College in the West for military veterans. Our services in place include a support system for members of the military and veterans who enroll at any of the University’s locations. This web of support includes a VA Specialist Certifying Official, liaisons within the enrollment teams, membership in a Student Veteran Organization, and recognition at Commencement. SLIDE 5: The Native American Student Programs, part of Campus Diversity & Inclusion at the University, hosted an inaugural Powwow in March. The powwow, which drew 3,000 visitors from all over the nation, celebrated Native American dance, drumming, and singing from tribes of the plains region of the United States. Together with the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians and the Native American Resource Center of Highland, we reaffirm our commitment to help transition and support Native American students (both young and adult) in their educational journey through the University of Redlands. SLIDE 6: Our University embraces the many ways it can extend unique learning opportunities. Last November, we partnered with Esri – the world’s industry leader in geographic information system technology located here in Redlands – to celebrate Redlands GIS Day 2013. Along with the City of Redlands, we were proud co-hosts of an event that showcases how GIS technology is making a difference by improving lives, enhancing learning, and helping solve real-world problems in Redlands and beyond. SLIDE 7: In the area of campus and community sustainability, Redlands co-hosted the 2nd Annual Sustainability Festival in March. This event drew close to 700 visitors, over 80 exhibitors, nonprofit organizations, and sustainable businesses with a focus on community education and ways to make Redlands a greener, healthier, and economically viable community. One outgrowth of this festival is the implementation of our new Ozzi take-out box system a move sponsored totally by the ASUR. Over 900 reusable boxes were sold the first week to offset the use of paper boxes for take-out food. This move helps the environment and will save $25,000 per year. SLIDE 8: Related to sustainability, Hedco Chair and Professor of Environmental Studies, Monty Hempel premiered his documentary entitled, “Blood and Coral,” in New York. His feature documentary examines the impact of climate change and overfishing on coral reef ecosystems, while also addressing the attainable and regenerative power of environmental stewardship. SLIDE 9: Dr. Kathleen Feeley, Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of History, co-edited When Private talk Goes Public: Gossip in American History with Dr. Jennifer Frost. Published just last month, her book was described as an “engaging volume [that] brings together a captivating array of case studies in the history of American gossip, from colonial witchcraft trials to the era of People magazine and then Internet celebrities,” in which different disciplinary experts “explore the role of gossip in American society, culture, and politics, tracing its transformations and continuities over time and making a convincing case that we should reassess this too-readily dismissed variety of social exchange.” SLIDE 10: Dr. Lawrence W. Gross, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians Chair of Native American Studies and Assistant Professor in the Race and Ethnic Studies program published Anishinaabe Ways of Knowing and Being in summer 2014. Larry’s book is part of a series entitled “Vitality of Indigenous Religions,” about which we should hear more at his upcoming chair installation ceremony. SLIDE 11: The School of Music’s Pokorny Low Brass Seminar continues its success while garnering attention from well-respected journals in the music discipline and industry. The seminar was featured in the fall 2013 Tuba Euphonium Association Journal and this year made the cover of the Trombone Association Journal. For those of you unfamiliar with this annual event, this is an intense workshop for low brass players and is well-suited for professional symphony musicians, free-lancers, college teachers, graduate and undergraduate music majors, advanced high school students, and even dedicated amateurs. The seminar is in its 7th year, made possible by the collaborative efforts and dedication of Redlands former student and now principal tuba player for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Gene Pokorny, and our own Andrew Glendening. SLIDE 12: Visual and Media Studies Professor Piers Britton is an author, teacher, and leading expert in the areas of design and aesthetics in film and television. His book entitled, "TARDISbound", is an authoritative study on the popular British science fiction television series Dr. Who and its themes of trans-media migrations. His expertise and commentary were center stage as Dr. Who marked its 50th anniversary this past November. SLIDE 13: Award-winning poet and Edith R. White Distinguished Professor of English and Creative Writing, Ralph Angel, just published his fifth book of poetry entitled, “Your Moon.” Ralph is described as a “crucial poet of our time,” and one of “America’s most original poets.” His latest book was awarded the 2013 Green Rose Poetry Prize by New Issues Poetry & Prose. As Ralph’s prolific body of work continues to evolve and inspire, we here at Redlands are simply proud to call him one our own. SLIDE 14: Under the leadership of Barbara Murray, the John Stauffer Director of the Center for ScienceScience and Mathematics, we’ve come a long way since 1993 when we had six science majors who became the first cohort in the University’s formalized summer science research program. Under her guidance for the past 16 years, the Undergraduate Science Research Program has shown steady growth in both programmatic depth of instruction and scope of disciplines represented. Last year we accepted 26 students (from a possible 46); and since 2000, we’ve seen 319 students participate in the program. SLIDE 15: Organizations like the John Stauffer Charitable Trust have long supported science education at Redlands, giving significant resources for the Science Center, which with the director, both now bear the Stauffer name. In 2012, the Stauffer Trust took another step in sharing our commitment to quality undergraduate research activity by challenging the University to create a $3-million endowment for undergraduate research to which they would commit $1 million. The University is in the midst of meeting that challenge, having raised just over half a million dollars from individual donors and $500,000 from another outstanding foundation, the Fletcher Jones Foundation. Over the past twelve years, 1,486 students have graduated with a science major from Redlands. Yet only 14 percent have had the opportunity to participate in the summer research program. We remain focused on identifying comprehensive mentored research experiences that are essential to growing student success. SLIDE 16: The School of Business and the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership have been awarded a $200,000 federal grant as part of an initiative of the Obama Administration to accelerate the resurgence of manufacturing in the United States and create jobs across the country. SLIDE 17: Our faculty will use the grant to provide valuable economic analyses to regional governments, non-governmental agencies, and businesses to help the manufacturing incubators that will spur the economy. Johannes Moenius, director of the Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis, and his team are providing valuable economic analysis of regions with similar compositions of business activities as the Coachella Valley to help the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership formulate its strategy to develop manufacturing incubators and accelerators. Avijit Sarkar director of the Center for Business GIS and Spatial Analysis, along with faculty colleagues James Pick and Monica Perry have conducted in-depth case studies to deepen understanding of the specific needs that growth companies, startups and economic developers face in the Coachella Valley. Jim Spee, Professor in the School of Business is coordinating workshops for key stakeholders of the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership to expand their knowledge of GIS and its applications for small and medium sized enterprises and to discuss specific challenges of economic development in the Coachella Valley based on the findings from the Center for GIS and Business Analysis and the Institute for Spatial and Economic Analysis. SLIDE 18: Another noteworthy School of Business collaboration involved our own Professor James Pick, Professor Xi Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Redlands MBA alumnus, Tetushi Nishida from Japan. In their work, “Determinants of China’s Technology Utilization and Availability 2006-2009: A Spatial Analysis,” the trio mapped how people used mobile phones, the internet, and broadband, which revealed highest use in the megacities of Beijing and Shanghai, high-moderate use in the east and southeast, and very low use in the far west and north regions of China. Using spatial analysis, the group proposed regional IT development policies that are specific to geographic regions of China. SLIDE 19: This fall the School of Education welcomes its first matriculants into the Master of Arts in Learning and Teaching (MALT) program. MALT is an innovative enhancement to the School’s teacher credential programs that enables students to complete a master’s degree with six additional hours beyond the credential requirements. Early enrollment numbers have already exceeded expectations, with 108 new students; where the School had previously been teacher credential-focused, now a majority of new students are master’s degree candidates. This marked transformation in teacher education enrollment is consistent with the institutional goal of enhancing graduate programs. SLIDE 20: As evidence of the outstanding work of our faculty and staff, the National Council on Teacher Quality recognized our School of Education as one of only three top programs in California in training high school teachers earning Redlands ‘Top Ranked” status for overall performance. The Council’s review of teacher preparation programs focuses on the knowledge, skills, and academic attributes new teachers need to be classroom-ready when they graduate. This speaks volumes of the Redlands education experience in not only institutions of its profile, but on a national level. SLIDE 21: School of Education Associate Professor Pauline J. Reynolds released an ASHE Higher Education Report titled Representing "U": Popular Culture, Media, and Higher Education on September 9, 2014. The report positions artifacts of popular culture as pedagogic texts able to (mis)educate viewers and consumers regarding the purpose, values, and people of higher education. I’ll have more highlights about the student experience in the next segment. HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR SUCCESS IN THE 2013-2014 ACADEMIC YEAR: STUDENT EXPERIENCE Watch Segment 4 | 5:54 View Segment 4 Slides (download or view PDF) SLIDE 1: College of Arts and Sciences students logged nearly 124,000 community service hours, up from just over 104,000 last year. The breadth of outreach is immensely successful as students and faculty continue both to engage our communities and learn through service. For the seventh year in a row, the program was recognized with President Obama’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll with Distinction. SLIDE 2: A graduating senior explained it best when he said, “I wish I could say that the people I helped benefited the most, but I think the truth of it is that I benefitted the most from these different individuals touching my life”. SLIDE 3: Redlands became only the second campus on the West Coast (the other is at the University of Southern California) to open a Haven House. Located at the corner of University Street and College Avenue, The Haven is a unique residential community for students in recovery from substance abuse. The home, which is staffed by a dedicated Haven Recovery Coach and live-in house manager, houses approximately six students, each who pay an additional fee to live there. The Haven is a concrete step in our commitment to addressing substance abuse on campuses while providing real life solutions designed to support recovery. SLIDE 4: The College of Arts and Sciences continued its longstanding record of producing student scholars, including two Fulbright designees. As a great example, Kyle Van de Bittner, a double major in biochemistry and molecular biology will conduct research both in the biology and chemistry programs at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. This brings the total number of awards for graduating seniors to 17 over seven years, one of the highest proportionate ratios to size in the country. The faculty who prepare these students for interviews – Jack Osborn, Ben Aronson, Kimberley Coles, Denise Davis, Claudia Ingram, Wendy McIntyre, Barbara Pflanz, and Chris Walker – have seen remarkable success making Redlands equal to UC Berkeley in per-capita Fulbrights. SLIDE 5: Sophomore Anh Le, Class of 2016 was the first-ever Redlands recipient of the Boren Scholarship Award for International Study. The Boren is the highest award that the U.S. Department of State gives to an undergraduate. Anh will be studying through this academic year in Beijing. This prestigious award serves as the next step in her global business career path. SLIDE 6: This past September, 17 of our students took part in the week-long digital media festival called Project Accessible Hollywood. The brainchild of Redlands alumnus Christopher Coppola, it used the power of the digital media revolution and the Internet to connect people from all walks of life. Under the guidance of Professor Tony Suter, our students were paired with San Francisco Art Institute film students, and by collaborating, they produced short films, film scores, and “tone poems.” SLIDE 7: One of the participants in the Project Accessible Hollywood, composition major Kyle Hnedak has since gone on to win second place at the prestigious Concorso 2 Agosto International Composing Competition in Italy. Kyle’s orchestra piece, accompanied by a short film by an Italian filmmaker, made its world premiere this August in Bologna. Kyle’s achievement comes full circle, as his mentor Tony Suter once won the same competition that helped launch his career. SLIDES 8 - 9: Our students also excelled in athletics. It was another great year for our student athletes, with many more noteworthy accomplishments than I can list. Here are a few: Two NCAA individual national champions (swimmer Jeff Depew and golfer Bobby Holden) 128 University of Redlands Scholar-Athletes (who have a 3.5 cumulative GPA or higher as a member of a varsity team) 15 All-Americans 20 All-Region honorees More than 100 All-SCIAC awards, including five Athletes of the Year and one Freshman of the Year 12 programs out of 21 represented in the NCAA Division III Championships, with conference championships in football, softball, and lacrosse Multiple record-breaking performances and coaching milestones achieved SLIDE 10: Perhaps the most memorable moments for me came as we closed out the academic year with our commencement ceremonies, which were webcast for the first time in our history. I had the honor of conferring an undergraduate degree upon our oldest-ever graduate at age 89, Chris Kallimani, 65 years after he began his education at Redlands. Chris was inspired to complete his degree (he was short just one class) following a fall visit to campus. SLIDE 11: And equally inspiring was the honorary Doctorate in Music we bestowed on Morgan Kinghorn 46 years after he graduated from Redlands with a degree in Government. Morgan began his college career with a dual major in piano and government but ended up building a successful professional career as a senior federal administrator and financial consultant. He never lost his love for music and continues in his retirement to practice and seriously study piano and composition. That day underscored for me the beauty of a Redlands education – how your passion can be found here, cultivated, and take you on a life you never dreamed possible. A LOOK AT THE INCOMING CLASSES Watch Segment 5 | 3:02 View Segment 5 Slides (download or view PDF)   SLIDES 1 - 2: Just weeks ago, the College of Arts & Sciences welcomed 844 new students (that’s 758 freshman and 86 transfers) coming from 35 states and 8 countries. . . a larger than anticipated class because of an increase in “yield” that reversed the declining yield trend of 27 percent to 21 percent in the prior three years , and all despite the threatened 11 percent cut to the Cal Grant that loomed over us all spring. The academic quality profile of the class remains relatively consistent from recent years; nevertheless, we saw favorable trends that imply greater intellectual, experiential, and socioeconomic breadth. How so? SLIDE 3: There were increases in out-of-state students (to 33%); international students (to 2%); Pell grant recipients (up to 27%); and under-represented minority students (at a record 41%). Our entering class has 23 percent Cal Grant recipients which is consistent with last year’s figures. Our new students represent 24 different countries of citizenship around the world. I can say with confidence that this is the most diverse class we’ve ever welcomed to the University. It is safe to say U of R is a “hot” school! SLIDES 4 - 5: The School of Business experienced a significant upward enrollment trend in 2013-14, welcoming 946 new students (up from 839 last year) including 599 graduate students and 347 undergraduates. Increases were also noted in the total percentage of students who are attending with corporate and military benefits (approximately 25% of our adult and professional learners fall into these categories). SLIDES 6 - 7: The School of Education did not make enrollment progress in 2013-14 but welcomed 354 total new students, including 228 for teaching credentials; 69 master’s students; 12 doctoral students; and 45 students seeking professional credentialing or a graduate certificate. SLIDE 8: But for the 2014-15 year ahead, the School of Education has just reported a robust July start in its teacher preparation programs (140 new students on an expected plan of 119). Both Business and Education are reporting strong yields expected for fall 2014 (which continues through early 2015, ) and the School of Continuing Studies reports exceeding their 2013-14 target by over 100 students for a total of 880 enrollments, all signaling a very positive start to 2014-15 for Adult & Professional Education. THE FINANCIAL STATE OF THE UNIVERSITY Watch Segment 6 | 7:18 View Segment 6 Slides (download or view PDF)  SLIDE 1: For the first time after eight consecutive years (FY05 to FY13) of running negative net operating margins, the University’s net operating margin is projected to be $1.3 million, or a positive 1.1 percent. Let me tell you how we got there. Given the unexpected additional enrollments in the College and the School of Business, declining need for financial aid, steadily increasing retention, and given our tight control on expenses, the result was a gross positive of $5.4 million, or 3.1 percent of our total operating budget. Once these funds are used necessarily to reduce the University’s outstanding debt, to increase the reserves for deferred maintenance for our facilities, and to increase other cash reserves, the result is the positive 1.1 percent margin I noted. Our original financial projection for FY14 and net operating margin was merely to break even. One of the University’s main debt rating agencies, Fitch Ratings, places significant grading value on being able to generate a positive net operating margin. SLIDE 2: This past May, our Board of Trustees approved a fiscal year 2015 operating budget of $183 million. A primary financial goal is to improve the University’s balance sheet over time – by increasing liquidity reserves to the levels of comparable rated institutions and by reducing debt. By doing so, this will provide available funds for longer-term future needs. The approved budget included salary increases greater than the cost of living for employees, and that included contingent faculty for only the second consecutive year after no increases for 10 years for the College and School of Education and 5 years for the School of Business. We made a modest increase in the University’s contribution to employees’ 403(b) retirement accounts of 0.5 percent, bringing the current contribution to 7.75 percent for eligible employees. And we still have much progress to make there. But that budget, though balanced, shows disturbing trends, namely the slowing of net revenue growth, which if we allow it to occur would not allow us to create positive margin, nor contribute sufficiently to facilities maintenance. SLIDE 3: Over the past 10 years, net revenues (primarily tuition, room and board, less financial aid) have increased 50 percent or $40.6 million. The University’s internally funded financial aid (really a financial discount) has increased 148 percent or $36.6 million over the same 10-year period. Personnel expenditures have increased 48 percent or $21.8 million, and non-personnel support expenditures have increased 74 percent or $23.4 million over 10 years, in line with (as they must be) with net revenue growth. These are real risks. Our fiduciaries on the Board, our bond raters Moody’s and Fitch, and I live with the implications of these unsustainable financial risks. This is one reason why you’ve heard me speak so frequently about our need for new sources of revenue. SLIDE 4: Our aggregate endowment spending rate has exceeded the previously targeted 5.0 percent (by one method of calculation) in 5 out of the past 20 years, peaking at a high of 6.9 percent in fiscal year 2002. In current markets, and by current estimates, that target rate of 5.0 percent, too, is unsustainable. On December 7, 2013, the Board of Trustees approved an endowment spending rate of 4.8 percent. Although it has actually remained prudently under 5 percent for the past three years at 4.5 percent, it may need to drop further, as long-term estimates for equity markets now forecast lower returns. By rule of thumb, a university’s endowment is expected to be at least two to three times the institution’s operating budget. Thus, our operating budget for fiscal year 2015 of $183 million would equate to an endowment of approximately $366 to $550 million. Ours is approximately $155 million. By that measure, as well as by the peer ratios that benchmark endowment-per-student, we are woefully under-endowed. Hence, our fundraising campaign will focus on endowment. SLIDE 5: The total investment return on the University’s investment portfolio for fiscal year 2014 was 14.7 percent as compared to 10.6 percent for the prior fiscal year. Over the past ten years, our annualized average total investment return was 7.6 percent, approximately 0.6 percent above the average from National Association of College and University Business Officers, as based on the Commonfund Study of Endowments from 261 U.S. colleges and universities with assets of $101 million to $500 million. SLIDE 6: The University continues to be a “student-fee-dependent,” inadequately diversified institution financially. For fiscal year 2015, tuition, room and board as a percentage of total revenue is projected to be 95 percent. This is another reason for my consistent focus on non-correlating sources of revenue. Developing new and consistent sources of revenues will be critical to funding new institutional priorities and ensuring future financial stability. These can be from intellectual property, unrelated business income, outside conferences and programs, the campaign, and new philanthropic sources for student financial aid. The University has no current plan to issue or accept any additional debt from the issuance of bonds or loans. Fortunately, all of the University’s debt is at a fixed rate, and therefore the debt service will not be subject to increasing interest rates and additional interest expense when the Fed’s policy of “quantitative easing” ends and prevailing interest rates rise. Our focus in the future will be to reduce our outstanding debt obligations and debt service costs. Being able to reduce and/or refinance our debt with lower interest rates will also increase available net revenues. CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN HIGHER EDUCATION Watch Segment 7 | 4:50 View Segment 7 Slides (download or view PDF)    Let me now focus on two timely issues in American higher education that are consuming much of our time, and ones that we should tackle head on. First is the topic of constantly changing Title IX regulations. SLIDE 1: The debate on how to address sexual misconduct on college campuses continues to mystify the most experienced advocates (e.g., Senator Claire McCaskill and Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels) and several government agencies. In May 2013, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initially declared the University of Montana resolution agreement a “blueprint” for other institutions in announcing policy revisions the agencies deemed necessary for compliance with Title IX. But the agreement contained serious threats to student and faculty rights, including a shockingly broad definition of sexual harassment and a provision allowing for disciplinary action against a student or faculty member accused of sexual harassment prior to the completion of an investigation and hearing. Since then, the DOJ and OCR have changed their position and are now working toward a revised model. SLIDE 2: Nevertheless, the University of Redlands stands resolute with three simple principles: 1. Sexual misconduct will not be tolerated on our campus; 2. Sexual misconduct is never a victimless crime; 3. Sexual misconduct is to be reported transparently and responsibly under the Clery Act and is considered among the crimes of violence. SLIDE 3: Currently, the Department of Education is investigating 76 college campuses for possible Title IX violations, ranging from mishandling a case to complete lack of responsiveness. Although the final regulations for the enforcement of Title IX have yet to be released (due October 2014), we are making good faith efforts to review and revise our current Discrimination and Harassment policy to increase clarity, equitability, and fairness. In consultation with one of the leading and respected experts on Title IX and higher education law, we continue to move forward in a manner that puts us ahead of the curve. In the months to come, you can expect the following: The release of our revised Title IX policy, once approved by the Board of Trustees; Changes in our reporting structure – who are the “responsible employees” to whom a claimant reports? Changes to the investigative, disciplinary, and appeal procedures; An increase in the education and training on discrimination and harassment, especially related to sexual misconduct. It is our intention to develop an educational curriculum that exceeds the minimal expectations mandated by Title IX. We, as a university and community of lifelong learners, need to push past our apprehensions and learn how we can make a difference by empowering ourselves with the knowledge and skills necessary to address discrimination and harassment . . . without hesitation. Let us take on the challenge to be the true “blueprint” for other institutions to follow. SLIDE 4: A second vexed topic is the sometimes useful but sometimes inappropriate use of part-time adjunct faculty in American higher education. Nationwide, more than 50 percent of all faculty hold part-time appointments as adjunct or contingent instructors, and they are increasingly joining unions in a move to improve hours, wages, and benefits. SLIDE 5: Most of the adjuncts at Redlands are professionals who have careers elsewhere and greatly appreciate the chance to teach part-time here. We have made small moves to improve compensation and to involve adjunct faculty more in the life of the campus. But I challenge us to think more creatively how we can turn some adjunct positions into more continuing and nearly full-time positions, how we can more fairly compensate our adjunct faculty, bring them into more full participation in shared governance, and improve their working conditions. It seems all of us must manage a constantly changing present landscape in higher education. But together, we also must secure an inspiring vision for our future. In the next segment, I will talk about that emerging vision. ADVICE: Affordability, Digital Media, (University) Village, Internationalization, Campaign, and Enhancement Watch Segment 8 | 16:33 View Segment 8 Slides (download or view PDF) SLIDE 1: Now it is time for some ADVICE. I spent much of my career doling out medical advice. Now the opposite is true. I am now soliciting advice from every constituency . . . really . . . I want your advice on these matters that follow. Without it, we will never achieve our shared visions of our future. A. Affordability SLIDES 2 - 3: My first calling at Redlands was to “get – and keep – our financial house in order.” To what end do we make our finances prudent and orderly? It’s to ensure our brand of custom-fit, hand-tooled, experiential education is affordable for future generations. We have approached affordability in several ways. We have kept net tuition increases to an historic minimum rate, near the calculated CPI for higher education. We are prioritizing financial prudence, by managing in such a way as to align budgets with mission and to seek new efficiencies. And we recognized that the University had become too comfortable in its use of consultants, its familiar vendors, and financial assumptions. SLIDE 4: Here are examples of our new prudence just in this one year. We reduced the marketing and personnel budgets in the School of Continuing Studies, saving $715,000 per year. Another step was eliminating half of the positions within the Redlands Institute and repurposing the other half to necessary skilled positions within IT services, the Center for Spatial Studies, faculty research support, and other special projects – all serving the academic mission (savings of $409,000). We are engaged continually in a comprehensive study of and elimination of unnecessary external consultation – for example, first, the elimination of the annual use of “Sightlines” for facilities and various other leftover consultants for interior design, public financial management, and facilities, saving $75,000 annually, and second, the reduction by more than $400,000 of expenditures on what is known as “enrollment” coaching by the outside consultant “Inside Track” in the professional schools. We also greatly reduced banking fees by negotiating a new RFP-driven banking relationship after more than a half century with Bank of America, saving approximately $55,000 annually. As a result of these and other management changes, the savings this year alone totaled greater than $1.4 million. Given an endowment spending rate of 4.8 percent, this is the equivalent of an extra $29 million in new endowment. We have increased the annual contribution to liquidity to $2 million, bettering our operating margin (we now forecast a positive net operating margin for the first time in the past nine years) and enhancing our likelihood of stable or improving credit ratings. D. Digital Media/Online Education SLIDES 5 - 6: The Presidential Task Force on Online Learning continues to make progress. We have budgeted $250,000 in the first year for this initiative and $400,000 total over two years. We have awarded 9 development grants to faculty members. We completed construction of a new Center for Digital Learning, a state-of-the-art studio classroom and video production center. We appointed a terrifically talented Director of Academic Computing and Instructional Technology and are searching for an Instructional Design expert. The Task Force has also contributed to the development of a first-ever intellectual property policy, under the leadership of Associate Provost Ed Wingenbach and with the support of the Sponsored Research Working Group. The policy has been reviewed by an outside counsel expert in intellectual property law and will be presented to the Board of Trustees for discussion before approval. The Task Force is now helping to evaluate vendors with whom to partner in a pilot experiment to move some curriculum from traditional to online platforms in test programs in the Schools of Business and Education. We will selectively develop online courses and hybrid programs. V. (University) Village SLIDE 7: As we anticipate Redlands Rail and dream of our own University Village, we are largely still in the vision stage. More than anything else, we now need market research to discover the kinds of private investments that will pay off in a public/private partnership that would create a mixed-use residential/retail environment totally complementary to the town of Redlands yet one that will produce significant new revenue for U of R. SLIDE 8: We anticipate: Environmental impact documents to be certified and approved by spring 2015; The final design of the full 9-mile Rail to Redlands project completed mid-2017, followed by actual construction beginning by fall 2017; First trains expected in 2019 (quieter, smaller, high-efficiency European diesel trains, not the Metrolink’s current diesel engines); Full service shortly thereafter. Of course, the timeline remains somewhat fluid and subject to local or federal obstacles. The San Bernardino Associated Governments (SanBAG) needs the transportation dollars approved for their recent TIGER grant request to the Department of Transportation (and we are a formal supporter of that grant application). The Redlands Rail Project is a unique opportunity for a comprehensive public/private approach to increase transit options, enhance civic mobility, and support ongoing clean air regulations. The project’s scope includes thoughtful development of sustainable, pedestrian friendly, mixed-use civic and commercial spaces that highlight the unique features of our community while simultaneously enhancing the economic viability of the region. This project has been embraced by local government and business leaders since the 2006-2007 Redlands Passenger Rail Station Area Plan and the Downtown Redlands Specific Plan. As the lead public transit agency convening the project, San Bernardino Associated Governments has made this project its number one transit priority, wielding more than $230 million in federal, state, and private support for the project. SLIDE 9: To get ready, at a minimum, the University of Redlands will need this year to have at least a conceptual design for a train station, one that is a signature architectural piece typical of our University’s look, yet compatible with the funder’s design specifications. We have set aside only a small amount ($200,000) for station design work, pending review by the Campus Planning and Finance Committees. Carole Beswick intends to reconvene the ad hoc task force of trustees and colleagues who have expertise in development, including especially alumnus Steve Olson and his team of colleagues, trustee and former Mayor of San Bernardino, Pat Morris, and Brad Adams, Chair of the Trustee Campus Planning Committee, in order to launch the marketing research phase. Research is a next step. It would precede an eventual request for proposals from developers, assuming the research predicts market feasibility for leasing, income generation, and investor interest. Regarding my microbrew fantasy at University Village? By coincidence just a few months ago when I spoke at the annual Kappa Sigma Sigma Rendezvous, an alumnus Matt Adams, the co-founder of Prohibition Brewing Company in Vista, CA offered to consider bringing his brewing company to such a development. I. Internationalization SLIDE 10: This was a major focus this past year. I charged the University-wide Council on Comprehensive Internationalization as the first step in achieving this goal. SLIDE 11: The Council is chaired by Associate Provost Ed Wingenbach and includes three working groups focusing on the areas of international student recruitment in all schools, global learning, and international student services. The working groups, including faculty, staff, and administrators from across the University, conducted an inventory of existing international programs at the University, reviewed best practices for comprehensive internationalization, and engaged faculty and the campus community in discussions of internationalization. The Council has presented a draft report and recommendations, with short and long-term goals, a timeline and strategy, the needed resources, and possible options for international student recruitment and international programs. SLIDE 12: We also centralized international student recruitment within the Office of Enrollment, which has enabled us to have a more comprehensive and diversified approach to international recruitment. In January, we hired a seasoned international admissions professional, Ali Klein. Ali has already made our first foray into Latin America with a 10-day trip sponsored by the Council of International Schools in Colombia. On September 8, Brian Jauregui joined us as the new Director of International Recruitment for Adult & Professional Education. In this role, Brian will recruit and enroll international students into graduate programs in the Schools of Business and Education, as well as into the School of Music and the College’s MS-GIS program. This team started the academic year busy with recruitment activity, beginning with Latin America (visiting Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Panama, and Mexico). Later in the fall, they will focus on Asia (with trips to Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China). In addition, visits are being planned to Canada, the United Kingdom, and Turkey – all part of our vision to advance the emerging relationships developed by Jack Osborn, Kara Babb, and Menglin Jin that align with our strengths at Redlands. C. Campaign SLIDE 13: Over the last two years, I have been very clear that one of the primary goals I was given by the Trustees from day one was to lead our next comprehensive philanthropic campaign in order to strengthen the University of Redlands now and into the future. SLIDE 14: You will remember from the last State of the University address that the silent phase of the campaign began on July 1, 2013, with an initial campaign goal estimate of $200 million. The goal is to at least double the size of the endowment in this campaign while building a more deeply engaged community of donors, so that we may then launch another campaign, immediately following this one, that will triple the endowment from its current size. To recap, our current campaign will be a seven-year effort ending in 2020. It will seek to increase the level of cash gifts secured annually to $15-20 million from the current $8-10 million, to increase deferred and planned giving, to more than double the number of endowed professorships, and to increase greatly the number of endowed scholarships. Most importantly, it will be focused on ensuring the gift of a Redlands education for all time, by strengthening our financial position and our ability to seize new opportunities for innovation. We continue to move in earnest and very rapidly. Last year at this time we had roughly $30 million in commitments. I am pleased to report today that as of June 30, we have secured just over $79 million in leadership commitments and have a number of major proposals under development or consideration. On October 18, as part of our Homecoming Weekend, we will celebrate an important milestone celebration – details of which we are keeping a secret for just a little longer. This event will make history in several ways, but most importantly it will be an opportunity to see first-hand how, as Margaret Mead said so well “. . . a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.” I am asking you to join us in the Memorial Chapel at 2:30 pm on Saturday, October 18th for this important event in the life of the University of Redlands. E. Enhancement SLIDE 15: We seek to enhance master’s level programs in the College and Schools through sustainable enrollment growth that takes into account appropriate faculty and staff resources and the preservation of program quality. SLIDE 16: Here are some ways we plan to realize our potential as a master’s university: Institutionalize, perpetuate, and expand across all disciplines in the College what our faculty have done with the help of Hanson and Schroeder scholarships in business and languages to achieve not only Fulbright awards but Goldwaters, Trumans, Marshalls, and our first Rhodes Scholar. A “Center for Student Success” can be born, which does build on one of the compliments we received from WASC. Conceive and develop a variety of inter-school master’s degrees, such as (to name just a few possibilities) Business of Arts Management, Business of Music, Business of Higher Education, etc. Grow the size of the MS-GIS program, an international gem, and expand enrollments through the new MGIS program. Enlarge prudently the size of Communicative Disorders master’s program, while maintaining its stellar reputation, and add an endowed professorship. Grow the School of Music master’s degree programs. SLIDE 17: In the School of Education we will enhance master’s degree programs by: Developing a 4+1 pathway to the School of Education for College of Arts and Sciences students, targeting the Master of Arts in Learning and Teaching, and the Higher Education and Counseling master’s programs. Developing institutional partnership pathway programs with other colleges so that new baccalaureates can enter our School of Education graduate programs seamlessly. Developing selective master’s programs for enhanced online delivery or hybrid delivery, such as an internationally-focused mental health counseling program, or hybrid higher education programs with specialized paths (for example, Student Affairs, Business, General Administration). Reinvigorate the Ed.D. by examining the possibility of different program tracks, such as Educational Administration, Higher Education, or even Community College Leadership. So, remember: “A-D-V-I-C-E.” It’s very simple. I need your advice if we are to collaborate together in the creation of a truly inspiring vision for our future. CONCLUSION Watch Segment 9 | 2:16 # View Segment 9 Slides (download or view PDF) SLIDE 1: My vision for the finances, programmatic development, and enrollment success of this University converge. That vision is that by 2020 we will fulfill my assertion that “we are the hottest university”. . . and Jack Dangermond’s assertion to everyone he meets that we are the “greatest liberal arts university in the nation.” We will seek to achieve that vision through your continuing “ADVICE.” Our campus is again teeming with students, faculty, and staff as we welcome a new academic year. All of this creates an incredible vibrancy and renewed energy I hope will inspire each of you and set the stage for even more stellar accomplishments here at Redlands. SLIDE 2: If we keep our eyes on the future, a liberal arts education from Redlands will continue to prepare generations to embrace new ideas, learn how to be lifetime learners, and connect hearts and minds to service as global citizens. You well know that some of the biggest problems our world faces today – climate change, environmental toxins, neighboring nations at war, refugees, the geopolitics of water and oil, gun control, and immigration and displaced persons – all require critical and ethical thinking. Being a global citizen today requires awareness that a broad, unbounded education can foster a solid understanding of cultural, political, and societal differences. And that is what we are here to do: provide a foundation for that balance and self-realization while keeping an eye on quality. As I commented in my introduction, we are a University that is on a distinct upward trajectory. Now is the time to “buy stock” . . . in Redlands.
