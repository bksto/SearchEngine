For more information about each item listed, click on the heading to expand the description. Click on it again to collapse the description. Online - Online classes meet entirely online. Students never need to come to campus. Hybrid - Hybrid courses split class time between meeting in a traditional classroom setting on campus and the online environment. Enhanced - Enhanced classes are classes where the instructor is using some online component to augment what they are doing in the classroom. Online and hybrid courses have the same curriculum requirements and standards as their face-to-face counterparts. The only difference is the method of presentation. For more information on curriculum requirements, please visit the course catalog pages for details. Link to Catalog and Schedule Chaffey College has one process for registering or enrolling in all classes at the college. The process is the same for online, hybrid, or face-to-face classes. Please visit the College's Admissions and Records pages for more information on enrolling in classes at Chaffey College. Link to Admissions and Records Even if a class is full, it may still be possible to add the class to your schedule. Please visit the Admissions and Records pages for information on Waitlists and Add Codes. Online classes follow the same basic processes for online classes, but instead of attending the first class meeting to request an add code, students should follow the process as described on the Distance Education Waitlist or Adding web page. Link to Waitlist or Adding Page Online and hybrid courses have the same tuition and fee requirements as any other class at Chaffey College. Please visit the the Cashier's Office page for more information. Link to Cashier's Office Page Online - Online classes meet entirely online. Students will be able to access their online courses after noon on the first scheduled day of the class. Most instructors have some kind of first day activity for students to complete to ensure that they are active in the class. Students who fail to log on the first day and complete the assigned activity may be dropped from the course. After the first day, course access requirements vary depending on the course curriculum and activities. Most instructors do not have specific dates and times that students must log on to the class. However, there are due dates and times for assignments and activities. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that they have completed and submitted their work by the due date and time. For more information about what should be done the first day of an online class, visit the Getting Started (What to do on the First Day) page. Link to the Getting Started Page Hybrid - Hybrid courses meet online and face-to-face at a Chaffey College location. Students must attend the first class meeting on campus to avoid being dropped from the course. Instructors will explain online requirements at the first class meeting. The majority of online course content is in some sort of text format/documents. This could be PowerPoints, Word, or PDF documents. Just as in the face-to-face learning environment, instructors have individual teaching styles. Students should explore all areas of a course and familiarize themselves with each course.
