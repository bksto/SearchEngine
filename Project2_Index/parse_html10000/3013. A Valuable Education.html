Innovation is central to who we are and what we do. Here, students learn that knowledge isn’t just acquired in the classroom—life is their laboratory. Research Opportunities Undergraduates who take part in research gain insight into a career path. They are also introduced to cross-disciplinary research by UCSD grad students, researchers and faculty. Whether in the sciences, humanities, or the arts, you can find opportunities for research through the resources listed here or in your major department. Undergraduate Research Portal Academic Internship Program Faculty Mentor Program Value of Research Alexander Human Biology "You don’t have to be a science major; you don’t have to be any particular major. Every single major has some sort of research initiative, and it’s all very exciting, and the school really promotes that sort of environment." David Artis Dean of Undergraduate Research Initiatives "Research is a great leveler. If you’ve got a really good idea, it doesn’t much matter that you’re a first-year student, or a first-generation student whose family didn’t go to college. The quality of your work speaks louder than anything else. If you’re a smart student and doing good research, you’re going to get a lot of affirmation and support." Alumni Voices Dara Walsh '03 After receiving a BA in Human Development, she joined the Peace Corps in Morocco working as a Health-Hygiene/ Sanitation Volunteer. Her side projects include arranging surgeries for handicapped children in rural villages and working with physically and developmentally disabled children in the US and abroad. Danny Paz '03 Now Director of client services for ITZ credits, Paz has also worked with nonprofit service Long Way Home to build a school in rural Mayan community San Juan Comalapa by recycling the community’s garbage. This project won the BBC/Newsweek world Competition 2010 for showing “enterprise and innovation at a grassroots level.” Eleanor Mariano '77 She was the first Filipino-American to reach rank of Rear Admiral in the US Navy and the first female director of the White House Medical Unit. She is also the longest serving White House physician in American history. Jean Higgins '73 She is the Emmy-award winning executive producer for ground-breaking TV series LOST. First considering a major in oceanographic engineering, Higgins chose to pursue producing after taking a theatre performance class and a Philosophy course with Angela Davis at UCSD. Unique College System Modeled after the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in Great Britain, our college system provides a smaller setting for first- and second-years to better adjust to the university. Because these groups are by educational philosophy rather than by the field of study, students can get to know people from every major and every country.
