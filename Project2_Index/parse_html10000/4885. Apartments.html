Cut The Commute CSUDH's on-campus housing puts you steps away from your classes, your professors, and an array of resources right outside your door. Forget about driving or parking: Your commute is a short jaunt across our beautiful campus. Live Where You Learn Studies show that students who live on campus get better grades, finish their degrees faster, go to graduate school more often, and are happier with their college experience. Supportive Environment Our housing accommodations provide a quiet, distraction-free environment that’s conducive to living and learning. Our residential staff also communicates regularly with residents to identify any issues or challenges that may be affecting their academics or personal lives, and will connect students to the resources they need to address those issues. Build Your Life Skills Living on campus is a great way to develop your independent living skills. You'll discover the freedom and self discipline that come with having and taking care of your own space.
