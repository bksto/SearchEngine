Nearly every CSUSM undergraduate takes courses in the College either through its many degree programs or in General Education courses. We currently offer 17 Bachelor of Arts (BA), 5 Master of Arts (MA) and 28 minors. The College contributes richly to CSUSM’s General Education program, which serves all undergraduate students with coursework designed to develop broad basic knowledge and valuable skills. CHABSS faculty and staff are dedicated to excellence in teaching, research and creative efforts, and service. We provide a supportive learning atmosphere for students to pursue their studies with rich opportunities for interaction with their peers, faculty, and with our community partners. Students engage in active learning strategies appropriate to their discipline and, in doing so, they participate in the exciting process of discovery and  have a chance to learn in experiential and cooperative settings. The College encourages student learning that crosses traditional academic disciplinary boundaries. CHABSS graduates are well prepared to enter the world of work in a variety of careers, or to pursue post-baccalaureate study leading to advanced academic and professional degrees and credentials. Our courses teach students to write, to analyze, to speak publicly, to think creatively and critically, and to work collaboratively to achieve common goals. The College offers students the opportunity to master information literacy and new technologies that help them meet the challenges of the rapidly changing future. In addition students develop language skills and cultural awareness that can prepare them for life in our globally interdependent 21st century society. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
