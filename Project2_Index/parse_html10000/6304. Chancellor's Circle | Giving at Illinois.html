The University of Illinois is honored to recognize its leadership-level donors as members of the Chancellor’s Circle. These generous annual donors provide a foundation of support that allows the campus to remain strong and successful. The Chancellor’s Circle is truly a community, an annual giving society comprised of alumni and friends who cherish this institution and are dedicated to its future. Together, we share the mutual goal of benefiting the University, its faculty, and students. Chancellor’s Circle members are donors who give $2,500 or more each fiscal year to funds on any of the three U of I campuses. Donors are recognized at four different giving levels based on household cumulative contributions across all departments, programs, colleges, and campuses. Those levels are: Platinum – $25,000 or more Gold – $10,000-$24,999 Silver – $5,000-$9,999 Bronze – $2,500-$4,999 Any gift to the University during a fiscal year, except grants, estate distributions, and contracts are recognized by the Chancellor’s Circle. In other words, one-time major gifts; payments on open pledges; gifts made through a payroll deduction plan; annual fund gifts; gifts to public radio, the arts, and athletics all count toward membership in the Chancellor’s Circle for that fiscal year. Give to one, two or several funds on any of the University of Illinois campuses. Give when you make your usual gift during the year or give multiple times throughout the year. Once your gifts reach a total of $2,500 in that fiscal year (July 1 - June 30), you are automatically a member of the Chancellor’s Circle for that year. Matching gifts are also counted in the cumulative annual total for recognition. Chancellor’s Circle members are recognized in an annual honor roll, published after the close of the fiscal year. They also receive a welcome letter from the Chancellor and in some cases, invitations to and recognition at selected events throughout the year. The Chancellor’s Circle offers the opportunity for donors to be recognized by the University each year as leaders in annual giving.   Social Media Twitter Facebook RSS Itunes Flickr Youtube Calendar Sina Weibo University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Illinois Annual Fund 504 Swanlund Administration Building 601 East John Street, Champaign, IL 61820 (217) 333-9174 | fax: (217) 244-7080 © 2012 University of Illinois Board of Trustees
