We have something for everyone. If you're interested in sports, there are club, intramural, and varsity athletic teams. If it's Greek Life that interests you, join one of our 16 fraternities or sororities. If the arts are where your heart lies, join a musical or theater ensemble. To meet people who share your same cultural background or beliefs, join one of our many international organizations or religious groups. At WPI it's all about a sense of community without conformity.

Greek Life Roughly 30 percent of WPI students are members of the 16 fraternities and sororities on campus. Greek Life provides students with real-world experience that they can take with them into their professional careers. Members of fraternities and sororities are given opportunities to assume various leadership roles, from programming and recruiting, to house- and money management. They not only make friendships that last a lifetime, but also learn how to work with many diverse people toward a common goal—the growth and management of their chapter. Learn more on the Greek Life Programs website. Leadership Programs Many WPI students are accustomed to leading —many have done it all their lives. From leading classroom discussions, to leading their teams on the playing field, to leading the way on cutting-edge research, many of our students have excelled at providing direction for their peers. WPI recognizes this leadership ability in our students and provides programming to nurture new leaders and help existing leaders grow their skill set.
