Your link blue account is created within a business day of when, as a student you are accepted, or as an employee you are entered into payroll. The link blue account must be activated to login to services. Detailed instructions on activating an account are available on the Activating Your Account page. For further link blue information, visit the Account Services Site. Employees use the link blue account for Exchange Email. However, student email has moved to Google Gmail and Microsoft Live and are no longer associated with the link blue account. Additional information is available at www.uky.edu/ukit/help/email/cloudemail.
