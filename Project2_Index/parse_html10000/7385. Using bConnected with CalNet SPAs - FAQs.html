Berkeley Unified KB Knowledgebase Find:   Menu Full View Using bConnected with CalNet SPAs - FAQs A Special Purpose Account (SPA) is a CalNet ID that can be shared by multiple users for collaborative purposes. As of November 12, 2014, you will need to use a CalNet SPA to log into departmental bMail/bCal/bDrive accounts via the web. Here are some Frequently Asked Questions: Q: Can I continue to use my bConnected Key to log in to my departmental bMail/bCal/bDrive account? A: After November 12, 2014, web access to all existing departmental bMail/bCal/bDrive accounts must be accessed using a CalNet SPA, rather than using a bConnected key on the Google login screen. Please note that: It's only logging into the web interface of bMail/bCal/bDrive that will require the use of a CalNet SPA instead of the bConnected Key on a Google-branded login screen. If you have delegated access to a departmental account in bMail, you'll still be able to send mail as that departmental account from within your personal bMail account. "Delegated access" allows you to send the messages that show up as being from the departmental account, and "sent by" you. That access will not change. If you use a bConnected key to access a departmental bMail account via a third-party client (such as Mac OS X Mail or Microsoft Outlook), that access will not change. Q: Why can't I log in to my departmental bMail/bCal/bDrive account using the bmail web client? A: Most commonly, you were previously logging using a bConnected key on the Google login screen and you were not delegated on the account.  If the email account was previously set up for IMAP access, then you can gain immediate access by using  a desktop client like Thunderbird or Outlook per the instructions in How do I add my bMail account to Thunderbird. You can use the bMail/bCal/bDrive web client by asking the owner of the account to delegate access to your personal bmail account via 'Manage Your Account' . Or, the owner can request that you be added to the SPA by completing and submitting Special Purpose Account (SPA) Change Request Form.  Q: Will my bConnected Key still work on other clients? A: Yes, the bConnected Key will still work for clients and applications, but not for the web interface. Q: Will this change affect users’ existing delegations to a departmental account? A: No. Anyone who has been delegated to a bConnected account will still see it in the drop down list within their own account when using bMail. Q: Can I keep my bookmarked login page? A: No, you will need to change your bookmarked login pages after November 12, 2014. Go to http://bConnected.berkeley.edu to log in after November 12, 2014. Q: What if my departmental account is still on CalMail? A: For departmental accounts that are still on CalMail, you will use your normal method of accessing via SquirrelMail or Roundcube. When you are presented with the CAS authentication page, you will use the new SPA CalNet ID+Personal CalNet ID along with your personal CalNet passphrase. Q: Will my departmental account be deleted? A: No, we aren’t deleting any accounts. Q: Will email forwarding still work? A: Yes, email forwarding will still work. Q: Will I have access to my departmental account's bDrive and bCal after the conversion? A: Yes, you will still have access to bDrive and bCal.  You'll just have to log in to them via the new CalNet SPA. Q: Will an email application using Google as an STMP server still work? A: Yes, this will still work. No changes are necessary. Q: Will an email application using CalMail as an STMP server still work? A: Yes, this will still work. No changes are necessary.
