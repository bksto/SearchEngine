You should give thoughtful consideration to the options that will best suit your needs both immediately and in the long term.  It is normal to feel confused, overwhelmed, and even resentful of having to make decisions under these difficult circumstances. It may seem like you have lost control over your life and that it may never be restored. By utilizing the resources that you already have (coping skills, determination, trusted support persons) and the network of support that exists both on and off campus, you can strengthen your sense of hope and empowerment. One of the first ways to regain your sense of control can is by making the choices that you feel are best for you. We have provided the following list to inform you of your options and the possible outcomes.  The SARA Office is here to further assist you in making educated decisions.   We are available during regular office hours, Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM. You can contact us by calling 650-725-9129, scheduling an appointment at saraoffice@stanford.edu,  or visiting our office at Mariposa House, 585 Capistrano Way, Room 209. If you need immediate assistance after office hours, you can contact the on-call Residence Dean or Graduate Life Office Dean and request that they contact our staff.  You can also call the 24-Hour YWCA Stanford Rape Crisis Hotline at 650-725-9955 for anonymous and confidential advocacy and crisis counseling.    SARA Office About Us Get Help Get Immediate Help Sexual Misconduct & Sexual Assault Sexual Harassment & Stalking Relationship Abuse How to Help Prevention & Education Information & Resources Resources Not Alone Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy Office Student Resources and Reporting Options for Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Get Involved Get involved in the movement to end sexual and relationship violence!
