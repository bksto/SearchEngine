About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > Student Life Student Life Every college has a culture—and ours is close-knit, supportive, intellectual, and curious. If you’ve got an idea, pursue it. If you’ve got a passion, follow it. If you’ve got a question, you’ll get answers—or at least many people willing to help you find answers.    Redlands is an energetic, life-changing place—inside the classroom and out. And it all starts during new student orientation, which will introduce you to campus resources and opportunities.
