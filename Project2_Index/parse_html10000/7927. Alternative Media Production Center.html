Student should inquire at the AMPC to establish their account. Students who might benefit from this service need to receive this accommodation from their disability specialists as explained in the Office for Students with Disabilities Policies and Procedures Manual. Each quarter students who are currently eligible, and want to request materials, must fill out a signed Alternative Media Request Form, and submit that along with a copy of their class schedule, as soon as they register, to the Alternative Media Specialist in Student Affairs Building Room 113. Requests can be made through the OSD AIM database as well -- though students should follow up at the ATLC if they require specialized types of formatting of their etexts. The earlier the staff know of a student's need, the earlier they can begin working on providing students with alternative formatted materials. The last step for students is to turn in a copy of their receipts so that their e-books will be given to them after they are completed. Students who turn in the Alternative Media Request Form (AMRF) two weeks (or earlier) before the beginning of the next quarter will have their e-books ready on the first day of class. After that deadline, students will receive their books within 10 working days of their completed requests, as long as they have receipts showing that they have purchased their books. Short Materials including PowerPoint slides, pdf files, printed articles, syllabi, and notes must be obtained from the professor three days prior to use in the classroom to be converted into Alternative Media. Scientific and mathematical Braille requests will take longer as outside sources are used for their production.
