Intramural Sports The Intramural Sports program is designed to encourage students to participate in organized sport activities. These activities promote participation and socialization between groups and individuals, enhance physical fitness, and foster a spirit of fair play and sportsmanship. Penn Athletics Penn Athletics provides a host of athletic opportunities on both the intercollegiate and recreational levels that enrich the educational experience of University students, as well as provide recreational and fitness facilities and activities for the entire campus community. Penn Ice Rink The Penn Ice Rink at the Class of 1923 Arena is located on the southern tip of campus. The 2,900-seat stadium has been serving the University and local communities for over 40 years. The Rink is home to collegiate hockey teams, as well as numerous youth, scholastic and senior hockey teams throughout the Philadelphia region.

Penn Relays The first Penn Relay Carnival was held on April 21, 1895, in conjunction with the University's Spring Handicap Track and Field Games. The festival, the longest uninterrupted collegiate track meet in the country, routinely draws more than 100,000 spectators and more than 22,000 entries, about half of whom are high school students. Sport Clubs Club Sport participation is a major area within recreational sport. Those who desire club sport membership seek regular participation under a more coherent design than offered by informal or intramural activities. Club sports include aikido, cricket, curling, figure skating, ping pong and synchronized swimming. Wellness & Fitness Programs Penn faculty and staff have access to a variety of health and wellness resources to stay healthy and happy year round. Annual health fairs, held each April, feature free health screenings. "Maintain, Don't Gain" helps employees avoid gaining weight during the holiday season. Quit smoking resources can help faculty and staff finally kick that nasty habit.
