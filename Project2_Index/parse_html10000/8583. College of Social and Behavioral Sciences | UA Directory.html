Understanding human behavior, by looking at our language, history, governments, environment and social norms, is one of the keys to societal change. With popular majors like communication, political science and journalism, SBS teaches many UA students. The college has more than 5,400 students and grants more academic degrees than any other college at the UA. The most salient issues of our society – violence, poverty, global warming, unsafe sexual practices, divorce, and bigotry – are studied in SBS. Technological innovations allow our scientists to use new methods to study people and places, from speech analysis software to remote sensing to isotope ratio analysis of archaeological remains. SBS students receive a diverse, interdisciplinary education from professors who are committed to excellence in teaching. Dean: J.P. Jones, III College Features The College of Social and Behavioral Sciences is home to some of the University of Arizona’s most prestigious programs. Anthropology, communication, geography and development, linguistics, philosophy, sociology, and Latin American history are all ranked in the top 20 in the country. Renowned faculty includes: 3 MacArthur Fellows, 10 Regents’ Professors, and 2 University Distinguished Professors. In SBS, there are many opportunities for hands-on experience: students can help produce newspapers, participate in archaeological digs, assist with research projects, participate in Votesmart or do a legislative internship, and work with criminal justice and social service agencies. SBS has several unique centers/programs, including the world-class Philosophy of Freedom Center, one of the only Native American Linguistics and Languages Master’s programs in the country, and the only journalism program in the U.S. that regularly publishes a bilingual newspaper for a community. SBS continues to develop interdisciplinary new programs and curriculum. For instance, the new School of Government and Public Policy offers a unique combination of policy-oriented courses and provides training for students interested in government, politics and public policy.
