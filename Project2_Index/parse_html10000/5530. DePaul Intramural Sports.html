Click here to see how to register a team, as an individual, or as a free agent. Captains' Information - In order to register a team, captains must take a quiz on IM Leagues prior to being eligible to register a team.  Go to the Policy and Procedure page and the Sport Rules page for the answers to your questions or view our Online Captains' Meeting. After completing the quiz and registering the team, captains must complete a captains agreement (available at the front desk of The Ray), put a credit card on their member account (in the event of a forfeit), and must ensure that the minimum number of players are accepted onto the team roster.  Email Leanne Thompson with any questions.
