Graduate student contributions include but are not limited to: UC Merced course development and instruction, as readers, teaching assistants, and lead instructors; participation in pedagogical training and development programs; and developing or delivering materials or instruction at professional workshops and summer schools. The award is intended to recognize a body of teaching and pedagogical contributions during the course of graduate education. Complete Guidelines Application Closed (Next Application Cycle: March 2015) Eligibility Requirements & Standards UC Merced Masters’ and Ph.D. students may apply who are enrolled in 12 graduate units at the time of application. Applicants should be in good academic standing and making normative or better progress towards their degree. Applicants cannot be previous OTA award recipients. Award Each award recipient receives a fellowship of $1,000. Per federal guidelines, all fellowship and tuition support is taken into consideration when determining student loan eligibility. If you have received federal student loans during AY 2013-14, please note that this award could reduce your student loan eligibility, resulting in a loan overpayment. If so, this award would be applied to the overpayment and the remaining balance, if any, would then be disbursed. Your loan debt would then be reduced accordingly. Please check with financial aid before accepting any fellowships if you are concerned about the impact an award may have on your student loan eligibility. Funds may be used specifically for costs of attendance (i.e. tuition, fees, books and supplies) or for general support (living, transportation, and personal expenses) necessary to support the pursuit of educational and career goals.
