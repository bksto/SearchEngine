The faculty’s first priority is teaching; nearly all classes are taught by faculty members, not teaching assistants, and most classes have 40 or fewer students. DePaul’s deep connections with Chicago enable faculty members to draw on the city’s resources and incorporate community service and research into their classrooms. DePaul offers over 275 undergraduate and graduate degree programs through 10 colleges and schools. Its Vincentian tradition of providing a quality education to students from a broad range of backgrounds, with particular attention to first-generation students, has helped it become the country’s largest Catholic university, with over 25,000 students. Founded in 1898, DePaul has two primary campuses in Lincoln Park and the Loop, complemented by four suburban campuses, a growing array of online degrees and international programs, and partnerships around the globe.
