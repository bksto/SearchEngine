Scientific Diving Stem Cell Research – Menu – Policies & Compliance The Vice Chancellor for Research and units reporting to the VCR ensure University compliance with federal, state and local regulations applicable to research activities, promote the ethical and responsible conduct of research, and facilitate regulatory compliance by providing assistance and training to faculty, staff and students engaged in research. Many types of research involve multiple compliance responsibilities for the faculty member and for project personnel so it is likely that researchers will interact with multiple compliance units. This website contains information about regulatory authority, policies for research and the organizational units responsible for specific areas of research oversight within the University. Please contact the compliance units for assistance or if you have questions about compliance responsibilities.
