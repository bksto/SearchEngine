UIC currently encompasses more than 100 buildings on approximately 240 acres. Our medical school, located on the west side of campus, was originally formed in 1913—when a small group of colleges (Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy) incorporated with the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. In 1965, the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle opened its doors in the area we now refer to as our east side of campus. Today, most UIC undergraduate classes are held in this area. The U of I Medical Center and UICC consolidated in 1982 to form the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 2000, UIC began transforming its campus environment with its southern-edge expansion. The South Campus project revitalized a historic neighborhood that had been rapidly deteriorating. This successful multiphase project was completed in 2008. Today, the south side of campus is home to 1,500 student housing units; 930 private residential units; new retail establishments; and a large conference center. In addition, this project influenced the continued redevelopment of the area along Roosevelt Road—between the east and west sides of the UIC campus. You can get around easily using our Intracampus Bus Service. For more information about transportation, student services, policies and safety on campus, visit the Student Life website.
