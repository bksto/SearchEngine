As custodians of such data, they are also responsible to comply with all U-M information security and institutional data management policies and procedures as well as applicable laws, statutes, and regulations. These policies apply to university owned and managed computers as well as to personally owned devices used to access sensitive university data. You are responsible for protecting the data, and for knowing the appropriate places to store the data, how to securely dispose of the data, and how to report a breach or compromise of sensitive university data. Data Stewardship at U-M.  Individual faculty, researchers, and staff are expected to function as stewards of information and technology resources. Data stewards are assigned primary oversight over U-M institutional and administrative data areas. Handling University Data.  Access to institutional data—both sensitive and private/confidential—is based on need for access and agreement to appropriately use the information resources. Report an IT Security Incident.  All departments and U-M staff are required to immediately report suspected or actual breaches or compromises of sensitive university data. This includes incidents that involve loss, theft, or compromise of personally owned devices that store or handle sensitive data. Secure Data Deletion and Media Disposal.  Any media that has ever held, stored, or transmitted sensitive university data must be securely disposed of or destroyed. Sensitive Data Policies and Regulatory Compliance.  U-M has numerous legal and statutory obligations that require it to protect sensitive data and respect the rights and privacy of other people's information. Sensitive University Data.  Sensitive data refers to data whose unauthorized disclosure may have serious adverse effect on the university's reputation, resources, services, or individuals. There are several categories of sensitive data that are defined by laws, regulations, and U-M policy. Traveling with Technology.  Information to help you protect sensitive university data when traveling. University Data in the Cloud.  As cloud computing becomes more and more pervasive at U-M, it is important to understand the risks to university data when it is stored in the cloud, when it is and is not appropriate to store university data there, and how to maximize the privacy and security of cloud-based computing services. University Data and Personally Owned Devices. This describes the requirement to secure self-managed, personally-owned devices when they are used to access and maintain sensitive institutional data and provides links to resources to help you meet this obligation.
