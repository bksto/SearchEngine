This strategic plan encapsulates the key strengths and attributes of our University, and identifies the opportunities and challenges we confront. It defines our primary objectives as well as specific initiatives we must implement to strengthen our institutional vitality now and in the years ahead. The plan's purpose is to articulate Cal State Fullerton's forward-looking vision, provide a roadmap for next steps, and create University-wide consensus and alignment. The strategies proposed here will evolve and adapt to changing circumstances. Considered together, they sketch a big-picture view of Cal State Fullerton's priorities and most-pressing issues that will guide the University's deployment of its programmatic, faculty, staff and fiscal resources. This plan is built upon the foundation of the University's mission statement: Learning is preeminent at California State University, Fullerton. We aspire to combine the best qualities of teaching and research universities where actively engaged students, faculty and staff work in close collaboration to expand knowledge. Our affordable undergraduate and graduate programs provide students the best of current practice, theory and research and integrate professional studies with preparation in the arts and sciences. Through experiences in and out of the classroom, students develop the habit of intellectual inquiry, prepare for challenging professions, strengthen relationships to their communities and contribute productively to society. We are a comprehensive, regional university with a global outlook, located in Orange County, a technologically rich and culturally vibrant area of metropolitan Los Angeles. Our expertise and diversity serve as a distinctive resource and catalyst for partnerships with public and private organizations. We strive to be a center of activity essential to the intellectual, cultural and economic development of our region.     This site is maintained by Strategic Communications.  Last Published 10/20/14 To report problems or comments, please contact strategiccomm@fullerton.edu.
