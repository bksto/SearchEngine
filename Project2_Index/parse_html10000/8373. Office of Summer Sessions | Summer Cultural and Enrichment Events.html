Together you re-write the Odyssey of Homer using your own life stories. The cast is encouraged to develop their own unique voice supported by a network of university and community contributors including a mask maker, poet, storyteller, martial artist and hip-hop choreographer. This year, we're bringing up well-known music artists from LA to coach the cast and to appear in the show. The Odyssey Project seeks to demonstrate how artistic cooperation transcends class, racial and social barriers and how art with rehabilitation serves as an alternative to incarceration and penalty. The project is social change in action: it provides a democratic blueprint - a level playing field between teens in the juvenile justices system and UC students. It promotes leadership roles for youth through a creative process that serves as a teaching tool for life. It empowers and honors both groups by encouraging self-determination and choice making abilities with positive outcomes.

Naked Shakes Production Fri, Sept 5 / 7:00pm (public opening) / Theater & Dance West, Room 1507, UCSB / FREE Sat, Sept 6 / 2:00pm & 7:00pm / Theater & Dance West, Room 1507, UCSB / FREE Sun, Sept 7 / 2:00pm & 7:00pm / Theater & Dance West, Room 1507, UCSB / FREE UCSB's Naked Shakes' production of A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare. Naked Shakes is now in its ninth season at UCSB, and its mission since 2006 has been to present energetic, exciting, raw, vibrant Shakespeare using the power of the actors and the language. Naked Shakes believes in the transformation of the actor and the space, along with the imaginative ability of the audience. Each play is presented clearly and directly so that the audience inhabits the imaginative world of the play through Shakespeare's language. The barren physical theater space is very important to the Naked Shakes concept; it takes on the identity of whatever locale or particular piece of poetic language is described, and yet always reminds the audience they are in a theater.
