Dr. Steve Morics, professor of mathematics   Dr. Steve Morics, professor of mathematics Dr. Steve Morics has been named Professor of the Year for 2014-15, or as one student labels him, "Best. Professor. Ever." Morics started work in 1995 at the University of Redlands in the departments of mathematics and computer science. He says, "I came because it was a small school (much smaller in those days) which emphasized teaching and was committed to the liberal arts." Morics holds bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in mathematics. After completing his undergraduate work at St. Olaf College, he continued his education at the University of Virginia. "I think I always thought I would be a professor, but I have a wide variety of interests, so the question of  'professor of what?' stuck with me for the first couple of years of my undergraduate experience. Had St. Olaf done minors, I would have had at least four: history, English, religion, and medieval studies. "I decided to focus on math because of an experience in the spring semester of my first year when I had just completed honors calculus II with an A+. I figured I was so good that I was doing the math department a favor by taking its next mathematics class, linear algebra. I got the worst grade in the class on the first exam. It was at that point that I realized I would have to work at mathematics and that someone was going to have to teach it to me. I enjoyed reading fiction and history, but I enjoyed learning about those subjects on my own. But in mathematics, I enjoyed working with people: my professors and other students. And I began to see myself as a math professor, working with and helping my students they way my professors were working with me.' Morics incorporates technology, inquiry-based learning and alternative methods of assessment into his innovative teaching style that he says is "constantly evolving." "I've used various alternative approaches in my classroom since my first days here: group activities, presentations, computer labs, project-based assessment, journals (in a mathematics class!), and inquiry-based learning. But, the overriding theme throughout has been to get students to become engaged in, and responsible for, their own learning. My favorite comment from students, which I occasionally receive from students at all levels, ranging from a business major in Calculus I to a senior mathematics major, is that I expect a lot from my students, but that I give them the opportunity and resources to succeed." He serves on Johnston Grad contract committees and honors committees for students in accounting, economics German, and mathematics. He helped create an extremely popular multi-department May Term class on Game Theory with the economics department. For the past three summers, Morics has led summer research in areas such as Grafts of Flips of Triangulations. "Students at Redlands, at least most of those who find their way to the second floor of Appleton, are hard working, enthusiastic, and curious. I was honored to be the representative of the mathematics department when a group of faculty traveled with the architect and vice-president for finance on a retreat to discuss plans for what is now Appleton Hall. I was able to share observations about my favorite mathematics buildings on the campuses I've been to, and I'm pleased to see several of my suggestions incorporated into the new building, including faculty offices that open onto an open study area for students, a kitchen accessible by faculty and students alike, and white boards galore! The students make excellent use of the space, and I'm always happy to have their work sessions spill into my office. I especially enjoy helping students from classes I'm not teaching or as they work on their senior projects, as I enjoy the challenge of working them on a subject with which I'm not terribly familiar, because our work becomes more collegial and collaborative than hierarchical." His students write: "He is a great professor who puts teaching first, not only helping with class but helping prepare for life as well.” "He has such enthusiasm for mathematics and teaching that I have found an even greater passion for the subject.” “He manages to add a sense of humor when teaching ridiculously hard math concepts.” "Professor Morics is kind, encouraging, helpful and fun to be around and I cannot think of anyone who deserves this award as much as he does.” Morics is also a huge supporter of the performing arts. His involvement takes place in many forms, including participation in University productions such as Fantastics, and playing the trumpet in the Redlands Community Orchestra, and the Redlands Symphony as well as conducting a hand bell choir.  When he is unable to play in a Redlands production, he makes sure to attend and help promote it around the university and community. He says he finds himself a little dumbfounded, but rather honored by receiving this award, and considers it a career highlight. "I'm touched that students in my classes took the time to fill out the online survey to express their appreciation for me. "I have been gratified to see former students excel as mathematics professors and in other venues. My favorite 'liberal arts' moment was teaching a Proudian class, during which we took a field trip to see the play Copenhagen in Los Angeles. During intermission, we began talking about what we'd seen so far, in the context of the mathematics we'd been discussing in class. I did my best to explain Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (a plot point in the play), a theater major began talking about the Fibonacci numbers he was finding in the stage design, and so on, and as we talked, I noticed other play-goers starting to listen in and eavesdrop on our conversation. I enjoy crossing disciplines." Morics says he was happy "simply to be nominated" and would not have minded losing to any of the other nominees. "I am curious to know what it was about the nominations that led the members of Mortar Board to select me, because if it was how well-written the nominations were, I'm going to have to go easier on my students' writing assignments...."
