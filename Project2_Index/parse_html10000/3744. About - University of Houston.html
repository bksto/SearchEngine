The Human Situation course plays a central role in an Honors education during a student’s freshman year. Honors faculty team-teach from a menu of the world’s greatest texts, encouraging each participant to seek the edge of his or her understanding . . . and then push beyond.  In addition to exclusive amenities and special privileges, our students benefit from a dynamic learning environment and one-on-one mentoring from world-renowned faculty. Through a challenging and well-balanced curriculum, our students learn both the skills they will need for professional success, and how and when to apply them.
