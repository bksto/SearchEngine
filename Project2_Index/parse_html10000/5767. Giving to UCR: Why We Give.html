Whether from community members, family of graduates or graduates of UCR themselves, each generous donation ensures that UCR can continue its tradition of institutional excellence. We are content in knowing that UCR will continue to provide innumerable opportunities for others as it did for our children. And for that reason we say Thank you. Ruby Frazier Trustee, UCR Foundation The Frazier family came to Riverside in the fall of 2002 when their daughter, Briana, began her college career as a freshman at UCR. The Frazier family credits their move to Riverside as the impetus needed to fulfill their dreams of forming their own real estate company. For that reason and the countless opportunities provided by UCR and the city, Ruby Frazier and her daughters, Jessica ('05), Briana ('06) and Erica, felt compelled to give back to UCR through the Chancellor's Associates Program. Through their contributions, the Fraziers are able to stay informed, become more actively involved and participate financially in the development and growth of the campus. It has been very fulfilling to spend our careers on this campus and we want UCR to be able to continue to offer these opportunities to those who follow us. Dr. Helen Henry and Dr. Anthony Norman Dr. Anthony Norman and Dr. Helen Henry have served on the faculty of the Department of Biochemistry for 47 and 32 years, respectively. During this time they came to appreciate what they described as the "extraordinary opportunity" to spend their academic careers at the same outstanding university, allowing both independence and collaboration in their research. The couple describes UCR as "the jewel" of the University of California, which they believe to be the greatest public university system in the world. They publicly demonstrated their affection and support through a legacy brick outside the Alumni and Visitors Center. Beneath their names, the brick reads: "UCR: The Gem of UC." Over the last two decades, the wife and husband team of Henry and Norman have demonstrated their gratitude towards the university by providing financial support to a variety of areas, including two where they had a personal interest: the Academic Senate and Intercollegiate Athletics. Both Henry and Norman have been very active in the senate, with Norman serving as chair from 2008 to 2010, and the two can frequently be found at Highlander sporting events. In addition, Norman, a collegiate tennis and soccer player himself at Oberlin College, served for over a decade as the faculty athletic representative for the Highlander program. In no small measure, because of our education at UCR, we are fortunate to be able to donate to special UCR programs. Mr. Dwight Tate and Dr. Katherine Wright Dwight Tate and Dr. Katherine Wright have deep connections to UC Riverside. As a child, Kathy enjoyed riding her bike through campus and visiting the small market within the married student housing area. She went on to earn her California elementary teaching credential, master’s degree, and administrative services credential from UCR. She is a retired district administrator with Riverside's Alvord Unified School District and interacts with UCR's Graduate School of Education by serving on the Dean's Advisory Board. Born and raised in Riverside, Dwight attended UCR from 1966-68, finishing his bachelor's degree at UC Berkeley. He returned to UCR to obtain a secondary teaching credential in 1971. Staying close to his roots, Dwight works in Riverside.
