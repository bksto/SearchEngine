CSULB offers an excellent graduate education and our graduates have a high rate of placement in Ph.D. programs and jobs nationwide. If you are interested in coming to CSULB and work towards a Master's degree in Shark Lab, you must supply several pieces of information before you will be offered sponsorship of your application. Prospective students must send a detailed Curriculum Vitae (including their GPA and GRE scores and a list of three references). In addition, prospective students should send a preproposal of some project you would be interested in working on if you were to come to CSULB. This preproposal is a short 2-3 page description of a potential project that includes a question or hypothesis, rationale for the research, and information on how the project will be accomplished (methods). This requires several things from the student: you must do your homework: develop a finely-honed question and find out what species are available here your question or hypothesis MUST be reasonable and stay within the focus of the lab's research interests (e.g. tagging or a behavior study of white sharks are not good MS project materials). This preproposal will help with assessment of your ability to formulate a testable hypothesis and your writing ability. The preproposal will help you to focus your ideas, and if accepted, could allow you to "hit the ground running" on a MS project. You will not be held to your preproposed project, if you later decide on something else, it is mainly an exercise that will allow assessment of your compatibility with the lab and the lab's research focus. If you have any questions about these items, please feel free to contact Dr. Chris Lowe (Chris.Lowe@csulb.edu). To learn more about the the MS Program or to apply, please visit the CSULB Department of Biological Sciences Master's of Science in Biology page.
