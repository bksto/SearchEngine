Centers of Distinction University of Redlands > Centers of Distinction > Truesdail Center for Communicative Disorders Truesdail Center for Communicative Disorders Service has been one of the central tenets guiding our curriculum at Redlands since our founders first broke ground on campus in 1907. As part of that commitment, we pride ourselves on the close relationship we share with the region in which we reside. One shining example, our Truesdail Center for Communicative Disorders, is one of the five Centers of Distinction that set us apart in California and nationally as an innovative liberal arts institution. We opened the Truesdail Center to offer our graduate students in the Department of Communicative Disorders a place to work directly with clients while also servicing our community. Under the supervision of clinically certified faculty, you will work with adults, children and infants with speech, language, hearing and swallowing needs.   Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: Banta Center for Business, Ethics & Society School of Music Johnston Center for Integrative Studies Truesdail Center for Communicative Disorders Center for Educational Justice Center for Spatial Studies Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories There are more than 1,700 trees on the University of Redlands campus.
