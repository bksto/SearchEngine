Food for Thought Teaching & Learning Series The Food for Thought Teaching & Learning Series consists of 8-12 seminars and workshops each academic year, most often given by WPI faculty and staff. The purpose of this series is to stimulate dialogue and reflection on teaching and student learning, to exchange teaching ideas and evidence-based promising practices, and to showcase teaching and curricular innovations. Within this series each year, there are typically several events on Writing Across the Curriculum and Technology for Teaching and Learning. Frontiers of Engineering Education - Educational Innovation Seminar Series The Frontiers of Engineering Education - Educational Innovation Seminar Series brings national leaders in teaching and learning to the WPI campus on an annual basis.
