To find resources and assistance with each step, simply click on that part of the graphic: Getting Started: What are SLOs? Student Learning Outcomes are statements which define what students should be able to do upon the completion of a course or program. SLOs articulate not only what students are expected to learn, but also how student work will be evaluated, and what counts as evidence of student learning. Faculty set appropriate learning standards for learning quality, and the evidence gleaned from the process provides us valuable information about the effectiveness of our courses and programs. Assessing student learning outcomes, and collecting data on student learning, enables us to develop a "culture of evidence" with the goal of improving student learning. What is Assessment all about? An ongoing process aimed at understanding and improving student learning. Faculty making learning expectations explicit and public. Faculty setting appropriate standards for learning quality. Systematically gathering, analyzing and interpreting evidence to determine how well student performance matches agreed upon faculty expectations & standards. Using results to document, explain and improve teaching & learning performance.
