HUA: How to Apply Some HUA Project Centers allow students to combine at least three courses on campus with one term studying the HUA at a Project center.  Since some HUA Project Centers are equivalent to 3 courses, students may use it to complete the requirement.  Here are the steps to apply: 1. Attend site information sessions and browse programs online.  Each Project Center holds information sessions.  Please make every effort to attend this information session to receive more information and speak with the advisor(s).  You may browse brochures for Project Centers through the Global Portal. 2. Apply.  Once you have decided on a Project Center, start your application by clicking "Apply Now" on the Program Brochure. Then select "I have a username and password" to prompt the WPI login screen.  You should login with your WPI credentials. All applicants must be in good academic standing at the time of application. Be sure to read and complete all documents in the "Application Questionnaires" section and the "Signature Documents" section on your applicant page. You will see a check mark after you complete the section. Important Note for All Applicants: You must start an application before you can log in to this site. Any time that you are trying to log into the Global Portal Website prior to having started an application you will get an error message. 3. Interview.  Each applicant will be interviewed.  The Center Director will contact you to set up an interview after the application deadline has passed. 4. Notification and confirmation.  You will receive notification from IGSD informing you of the outcome of your application:  accepted, provisionally accepted, waitlisted, or not accepted.  You must review and return the appropriate documents and deposit (links to these requirements will appear on your applicant page) to the IGSD by the deadline to secure your participation in the program. If you are accepted to a Project Center, you must let us know whether or not you wish accept the placement.   If you decline your placement your slot will be opened up to candidates on the waitlist and you will forfeit your opportunity to participate in the program.
