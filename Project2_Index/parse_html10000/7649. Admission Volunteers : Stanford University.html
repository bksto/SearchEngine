Admission Volunteers College Counselors Parents/Families Admission Volunteers (OVAL) Welcome to OVAL! OVAL stands for Outreach Volunteer Alumni Link. OVAL members are alumni (and in some cases parent) ambassadors all over the country and the world who represent Stanford for the Office of Undergraduate Admission in a host of outreach activities. OVAL volunteers: share their Stanford experiences with students; and serve as resources for students who want to learn more about Stanford. Our members are everywhere, including many places that our staff cannot physically be. Through OVAL we hope to mobilize Stanford alumni/parents to help Stanford reach schools, neighborhoods and communities across the globe, and especially those underserved by traditional educational resources. OVAL Opportunities Attending local college fairs Attending regional information sessions Serving on panels for prospective students Attending/hosting admitted student receptions Conducting applicant interviews (in selected areas) Hosting volunteer training workshops Serving on a regional OVAL leadership team For most volunteers, the OVAL time commitment will be about 5-15 hours per year.
