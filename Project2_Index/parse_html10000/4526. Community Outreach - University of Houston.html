From African American Studies to World Cultures and Literatures you'll find projects from free lectures and workshops to clothing and canned food drives. Each department in CLASS has developed a commitment to the communities associated with their fields of study as well as the city of Houston and surrounding areas.

Past Events Fairy Godmother Project The Women's Resource Center and CLASS teamed up with The Houston Fairy Godmother Project to collect prom dresses for area disadvantaged students. Eighty-seven dresses were initially collected, but just before the delivery was to be made to the Fairy Godmother Project shopping day event, a last-minute surge of donations pushed the total number of dresses to 127. Thank you to all the generous donors who helped make prom a memorable event for so many young women. Communication major and Graffit-e reporter Sasha Schwendenwein created a special promo for this community outreach initiative, watch it on YouTube.
