It provides information on what to expect after you receive an offer of admission to the University and prior to registering for classes. For information on registering for classes, go to Registration  Basics. After reading the appropriate section below, please make sure you also read and familiarize yourself with the University's procedures for registration, fee payment and official email notifications to ensure a successful registration experience. New Undergraduate Students Returning Undergraduate Students New and Returning Postbaccalaureate (Graduate) Students Concurrent/Visitor Enrollment (CSU students from other campuses) Cross Enrollment (UC and CCC students from other campuses) New Undergraduate Students After receiving your offer of admission to the University, you will receive a ‘Welcome Kit’ followed by information about the University's Student Orientation, Advising and Registration (SOAR) program. Welcome kits can be found on the Enrollment Services website beginning in March for the Fall semester and beginning in October for the Spring semester. New students are required to accept their admission offer and pay a non-refundable $150 enrollment deposit in order to reserve a spot in the class; an Admitted Student Reply form is included in the Welcome Kit for this purpose. SOAR program information is emailed to freshman and transfer students beginning in April for the Fall semester, and to transfer students beginning in November for the Spring semester. If you are admitted after these dates, you will receive information on the SOAR program in an emailed registration appointment notification. New students are required to sign-up for a SOAR workshop. The program includes advising, assistance with class selection, and orientation to campus life. For more information, go to SOAR. When you register for a SOAR workshop, you will receive an emailed workshop confirmation that will include your workshop and enrollment date and time, what to bring, and information on payment and any holds on your record that may prevent registration. All new undergraduate students are required to seek academic advising prior to registering for classes the first semester. See Registration Details for more information on the registration process. Freshmen students are also required to seek advising prior to registration for their second semester classes. The University Center for Undergraduate Advising provides helpful information for new students. For information on registering for classes, go to Registration  Basics.
