Our General Education Honors Program is tailored for high-achieving freshmen. An economic asset: The University is vital to the Sacramento area, contributing nearly $1 billion annually. A beautiful campus: We’re particularly proud of our 300-acre campus with its lush landscaping and 3,000 trees. Miles of pedestrian and bicycle trails stretch along the nearby American River Parkway, linking our campus and student housing with recreational areas such as Folsom Lake. A leader in “green”: Two major campus buildings – the University’s recreation and wellness center, known as The WELL, and the American River Courtyard residence hall – are certified LEED Gold for achieving environmental industry standards. The campus is also home to the California Smart Grid Center, which develops technological solutions to help utility companies respond to peak electrical power demands. An active student body: More than half of Sac State’s students join at least one of 276 student organizations, and more than 5,000 participate in the intramural sports program. At the heart of the latter is The WELL, home to numerous workout rooms, rock-climbing walls, an indoor track, and basketball and racquetball courts. Meanwhile, about 500 intercollegiate athletes compete at the Division I level. Elsewhere on campus, you’ll find arts programs, speeches, debates, comedy shows and concerts throughout the year. Our students also get involved in the community: About 36 percent volunteer more than 2 million hours each year. A top education value: Sac State’s student fees remain among the nation’s lowest. About one-third of our students receive some form of financial assistance. A dynamic destination: Sacramento is one of California’s most affordable metropolitan cities, offering dozens of stylish restaurants, galleries, shopping centers and boutiques within minutes of campus. The region’s parks, rivers and nearby recreation areas make it popular with outdoors enthusiasts. And San Francisco, the Napa and Sonoma valleys, the Gold Country and Lake Tahoe are all within easy driving distance.  Percentages based on Fall 2014 Census Contact A to Z Index Accessibility Sacramento State California State University, Sacramento 6000 J Street Sacramento, CA 95819 Phone (916) 278-6011
