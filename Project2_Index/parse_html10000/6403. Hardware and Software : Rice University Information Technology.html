Only a few departments provide computers for their graduate students; check with your department's graduate student coordinator for details.  Undergraduates are not required to bring a computer to Rice, but most of the students bring a laptop and a mobile device like a smart phone or a tablet or pad. Purchasing Hardware Rice faculty and staff, begin the purchasing process by contacting the IT Help Desk (713.348.4357 or helpdesk@rice.edu) to determine which type of computer will meet your needs. Graduate and Undergraduate students, see the list of minimum specifications (spec list) before you buy a personal computer to use at Rice.   Undergraduates, see the Campus Computing 101 PDF to see the kinds of computers current students chose to bring to Rice.

Requesting Software for Rice Classrooms and Labs Software and other technology requests for Registrar-managed classrooms and labs are due to IT in early April each year.  In order to retain a stable environment throughout the academic year, changes to the class/lab software image after the fall semester begins are typically restricted to version updates required for spring courses.  Submit requests for mid-year software changes for classrooms and labs by November 1 each year.   A list of software applicatons loaded on the class/lab computers can be found in the EdTech web site.
