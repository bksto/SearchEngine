Working with other colleges, the College of Education is responsible for the vast majority of teacher education on campus. The college prepares special educators, school and rehabilitation counselors, school principals and superintendents, and leaders for K-12 and higher education. Research is a valuable part of our agenda, and we recognize that a formidable college will include a wide range of scholarship and research — from insight-based, fundamental research to engineering-focused programs of research and development. Dean: Ronald Marx, Ph.D. College Features The college secured a $27 million grant to examine how improvements in access to and quality of educational and health services impact young children’s development. No other state has ever done a longitudinal study like this. College of Education alumni are known throughout the world! The founder of Sesame Street’s, Joan Ganz Cooney, is one of our grads. Graduates include teachers, of course, but also researchers, counselors, school psychologists, special education teachers, principals, and superintendents — just to name a few. We’re home to the state’s only programs to prepare rehabilitation counselors and educators of the deaf and blind. The college is diverse. Nearly 27 percent of our students are minorities. About 23 percent of the college’s faculty is made up of minorities (16 percent of which is Hispanic). Our International Collection of Children’s and Adolescent Literature is the largest collection in America. There’s only one larger collection in the world.
