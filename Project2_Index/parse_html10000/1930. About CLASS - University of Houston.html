The largest and most diverse of the 12 colleges at the University of Houston, CLASS is home to 16 schools and departments, encompassing the creative and performing arts, humanities, and social sciences. Undergraduate and graduate majors cover the full-range of the human experience – from anthropology to human space exploration sciences. The College also offers social and cultural analysis in African American, Mexican American, Women's, Gender and Sexuality and other interdisciplinary studies programs. CLASS extends its scholarship to the university, City of Houston and nation through its policy, research and cultural centers, which include the Hobby Center for Public Policy, the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts and the University Speech, Language and Hearing Clinic. The College's goal is to stimulate and expand students' cultural, mental and physical explorations through rich course offerings, study abroad programs and campus events. We encourage students to delve into the questions of life while building critical and analytical skills that animate professions and launch successful careers. Our 345 permanent faculty members educate nearly 10,000 undergraduate majors and minors and 1,200 graduate students, preparing them for future studies and professional achievements. By accessing and using new communication and research tools, CLASS students increase their reasoning skills, cultural awareness, aesthetic appreciation and ethical judgment. That foundation gives them the capacity to pursue their passions. CLASS graduates are tomorrow's economists, journalists, actors, diplomats, lawyers and doctors. Whatever they choose to do in life, CLASS graduates are prepared to make meaningful contributions to multi-cultural societies and global economies.
