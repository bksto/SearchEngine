In this lecture, Montgomery investigates the ever-changing nature of truth and how the work of early scientists, theologians, and natural philosophers—which we often assume to be at odds—actually led to important developments in their fields.    From Prison to Poverty Sociologist Bruce Western is spending his year as the Evelyn Green Davis Fellow at Radcliffe to focus on a multiyear study that tracked the lives of 122 men and women who left prison and returned to their Boston neighborhoods. In an interview with the Harvard Gazette about his work, he shares insights into how social conditions of American poverty shape the lives of those released from incarceration.
