Lemek, who was also named MVC Golfer of the Year Tuesday afternoon, tied her school record low 54-hole total with a four-under 212 at the par-72 Panther Creek Country Club to claim MVC medalist honors by an impressive seven strokes.  Her 212 broke the previous Valley championship total of 215 which was set by Tulsa’s Sofie Eriksson in 1995 and later matched by Bradley’s Meaghan LeBlanc in 2005.  The individual title was Lemek’s third of the year to tie her own season mark and she is the first Brave to win the Valley’s individual title since Bari Erais in 2007.  Her one-over 73 lowered her season stroke average to 73.61, which would break the Valley season mark of 73.94 set by Samatha Richdale of Illinois State in 2005-06.  Sophomore Jenna Roadley (Winnipeg, Manitoba/Sturgeon Heights) fired a 76 on the final day to finish 20th at 228 for her second top 20 finish of the year.  Fellow sophomore Allison Walsh (Mt. Prospect, Ill./Mt. Prospect) shot an 80 to tie for 23rd (231) and freshman Paige Jordan (St. Charles, Ill./St. Charles East) was seven shots back in a tie for 35th (238), firing an 81 Tuesday.  Junior Katarina Mangieri (Galesburg, Ill./Galesburg) completed the scoring for the Braves at 251 to place 49th.  Wichita State won the team title by one stroke over Indiana State, posting the lowest team score (900) at the Valley Championship since 2007.  Indiana State, which shot the low round of the day (298) was second at 901 with Illinois State moving up into third at 906.  Southern Illinois edged Bradley by one shot, finishing fourth (908) and the Braves were fifth overall at 909 after opening the day first in the team standings.  Missouri State took sixth (916), followed by Evansville (7th – 925), Northern Iowa (8th – 927), Loyola (9th – 929) and Drake (10th – 934), respectively to round out the field.  More Headlines Lemek Earns MVC Golfer Of The Week Braves Finish 10th At Rain Shortened Amelia Island Intercollegiate Women's Golf Tied For 10th After Day One At Amelia Island Women's Golf Opens Spring Slate At Amelia Island Intercollegiate Another Record Semester in the Classroom Winter Golf Camp Registration Open Women's Golf Adds Trio During Fall Signing Period Lemek Selected As Nebraska Amateur Player Of The Year Danielle Lemek Named Country Financial Scholar-Athlete Of The Week Lemek Named MVC Golfer Of The Week Braves Finish Sixth; Lemek Ties For Seventh At Pat Bradley Invite Womens Golf Ninth; Lemek Tied For 12th At Pat Bradley Invite Women's Golf Ninth After Day One At Pat Bradley Invite Women's Golf Heads South For Pat Bradley Invite Braves Finish 14th At Rain-Shortened Bearcat Classic Launch Player Login Forgot Password x Live Events Live Event Schedule Softball: Bradley vs. Missouri St. Video Stream (03/21/15) Sat,  Mar 21 @  11:45 AM Braves Athletic Teams Men's Sports Baseball Basketball (M) Cross Country (M) Golf (M) Soccer Track & Field (M) Women's Sports Basketball (W) Cross Country (W) Golf (W) Softball Tennis (W) Track & Field (W) Volleyball ALSO ON BRADLEYBRAVES.COM Bradley All-Access Camps Compliance Email Updates Hall of Fame Mission Statement News Feed Photo Galleries Staff Directory Tickets Bradley University 2015 All rights reserved Contact Us Privacy & Terms FAQ Site Map
