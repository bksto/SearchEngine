Audiology involves the evaluation, treatment, and study of normal and impaired hearing mechanisms and perception. Speech-language pathologists treat children and adults with disorders of language and speech, which include disorders such as stuttering, voice and aphasia. The disorders may occur as a result of developmental delays, hearing disorders, mental retardation, anatomical and/or physiological limitations, brain injury, emotional disturbance or a variety of other causes. Communication disorders and hearing impairments occur at all ages, from early infancy to advanced adulthood. Audiologists evaluate the hearing abilities of individuals of all ages in school, medical and business settings. The undergraduate program in Communication Sciences and Disorders provides the pre-professional academic course work in audiology as well as speech pathology. Speech-language pathologists and audiologists have a wide range of job opportunities in schools, hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation programs, universities and private practice. There is a growing need for speech-language pathologists and audiologists.   Back to top Professional Organizations American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) The American Speech-Language Hearing Association (ASHA) is the professional organization for speech-language pathologists and audiologists (the American Academy of Audiology also serves audiologists). One function of ASHA is to offer an accreditation program for academic and clinical institutions. The academic accreditation agency is called the Council on Academic Accreditation. It examines academic programs and determines their eligibility for accreditation. This Council accredits the Communication Disorders Program of the University of Houston. The Communication Disorders Program of the University of Houston is accredited by this Council. This means that the program must adhere to guidelines in administering the academic and clinical programs. If you wish to contact the Council on Academic Accreditation you can write to them at ASHA National Office, 2200 Research Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20850-3289. The phone number is 301-296-5700. There are certain academic requirements that students must fulfill as well as clinical requirements that are mandatory. ASHA also has a public code of ethics. It is the responsibility of every student and professional to follow the code of ethics. This code is presented in the Appendix of the ASHA handbook. It will be discussed in several of your classes. Please read it. Visit web site » National Student Speech-Language Hearing Association (NSSLHA) The National Student Speech-Language Hearing Association (NSSLHA) is affiliated with ASHA.
