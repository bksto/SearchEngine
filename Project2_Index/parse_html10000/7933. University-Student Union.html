Community, Shortly after Commencement Weekend at Cal State L.A., construction will begin on the Union Plaza Project. The project will complete the original plans drafted when the University-Student Union was built and opened five years ago. The project will improve the Student Union Plaza area with additional outdoor seating, new stage lights and stage canopy, new landscaping, and improved general area lighting, electrical, and WiFi connectivity – see photo below for architect rendering of the Student Union Plaza post-construction. The construction is expected to start June 16, 2014 and run through Fall 2014. During this time, the Student Union Plaza area will be fenced off. No one will be able to enter campus from the Street of the Arts entrance extending from the Luckman. There will be some construction noise as well. The Student Union Plaza will be taken offline for reservations for outdoor events during Summer and Fall 2014, meaning there will be no outdoor events scheduled outside the Student Union during that time frame. If you have questions about the Union Plaza Project, please feel free to contact us at (323) 343-2450 or usu@calstatela.edu.
