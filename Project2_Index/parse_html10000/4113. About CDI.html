History of CDI Over the years, the functions undertaken by Campus Diversity and Inclusion have been covered by the University’s Equal Opportunity Officer and, with the creation of the Multicultural Center, by the Director of Multicultural Affairs. In the past five years, the University has moved to the current model: a department of Campus Diversity and Inclusion. CDI encompasses campus-wide programming, the Multicultural, Pride and Women’s Centers, International Student Services as well as First Generation Student Programs.
