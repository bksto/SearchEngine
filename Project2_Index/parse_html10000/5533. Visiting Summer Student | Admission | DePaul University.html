The process is designed for students who plan to take courses, but not pursue a degree at DePaul. Planning to take undergraduate classes? Undergraduate summer students have a variety of options, including five- and 10-week courses from any of our 10 colleges. Classes can be taken on a part-time or full-time basis. Looking to earn graduate credit? Not all graduate courses are available to visiting students. If you’re interested in earning graduate credit for summer courses, contact the college offering your course of interest to inquire about availability and admission. Admission Requirements Students will be required to submit standard biographical information and indicate whether they have: a minimum 2.0 GPA; good academic standing; or been dismissed, suspended or placed on probation for academic, judiciary or disciplinary reasons. Enrollment is open to eligible individuals, unless a prerequisite is noted in the course description. Application Process Visiting summer students will have access to a shortened version of DePaul's online application. (This does not apply to the Common App.) The new streamlined process includes: Waived application fee Admission notification within three business days of applying Access to course registration within three business days of applying Visiting students must submit an application for each quarter they wish to enroll. Application Deadlines Applications are accepted until the start date of your first course. Search Campus Connect for summer courses and start dates. Proof of English Competency All students educated outside of the United States must submit proof of English proficiency. A minimum TOEFL score of 550 (or 213 on the computer-based test) is required for all undergraduate applicants. Questions?
