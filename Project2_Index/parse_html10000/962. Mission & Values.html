Mission Statement The mission statement describes San Bernardino Valley College's reason for being. The district's Board of Trustees formally adopted this mission on June 13, 2002 and it was last revised on February 28, 2007: San Bernardino Valley College provides quality education and services that support a diverse community of learners. Vision The vision statement represents the collective sense of the direction the faculty, staff and administration would like to see the college move over the next decade. The district's Board of Trustees adopted the vision statement on June 13, 2002 and it was last revised on January 25, 2006: San Bernardino Valley College will become the college of choice for students in the Inland Empire and will be regarded as the alma mater of successful, lifelong learners. We will build our reputation on the quality of our programs and services and on the safety, comfort, and beauty of our campus. We will hold both our students and ourselves to high standards of achievement and will expect all members of the college community to function as informed, responsible, and active members of society. Values (Tenets) The college tenets describe the philosophy and values of San Bernardino Valley College's faculty, staff, and administration. We believe: That a well-educated populace is essential to the general welfare of the community. That a quality education empowers the student to think critically, to communicate clearly, and to grow personally and professionally. That an enriched learning environment promotes creativity, self-expression, and the development of critical thinking skills. That our strength as an institution is enhanced by the cultural diversity of our student population and staff. That we must provide students with access to the resources, services, and technological tools that will enable them to achieve their educational goals. That we can measure our success by the degree to which our students become self-sufficient learners and contributing members of society. That plans and decisions must be data driven, and based on an informed consideration of what will best serve students and the community. That we must model our commitment to lifelong learning by maintaining currency in our professions and subject disciplines. That, as part of the collegial consultation process, all levels of the college organization must openly engage in sharing ideas and suggestions to develop innovative ways to improve our programs and services. That interactions between all members of the college community must be marked by professionalism, intellectual openness, and mutual respect. That we must hold ourselves and our students to the highest ethical and intellectual standards. That we must maintain a current, meaningful and challenging curriculum. That students succeed best when following an educational plan and when enrolled in classes that meet their interests and goals, and match their level of academic preparedness. That all members of our campus community are entitled to learn and work in an environment that is free from physical, verbal, sexual, and/or emotional threat or harassment. That students learn best on a campus that is student-centered and aesthetically pleasing. That we must be responsible stewards of campus resources.
