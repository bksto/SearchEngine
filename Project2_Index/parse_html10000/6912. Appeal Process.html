UCSB does not set aside space in our class for students who appeal admission decisions. Every application has gone through extensive reviews. For more information on the selection process, please visit our Freshman Selection Criteria and Transfer Eligibility and Selection pages. For an appeal to have merit, it must bring to light new information that was not present in the application—information that clearly shows the student to be stronger overall than had been earlier evidenced. Submitting an Appeal for Fall Quarter 2015 To appeal for fall quarter 2015, send us a letter requesting that we reconsider your application. The letter must be written by the applicant. Appeals received after the deadline may not be considered. Email or fax submissions will not be reviewed. Postmark Deadline Freshman applicants: April 15, 2015 Transfer applicants: as soon as possible before August 1, 2015 The letter must state the applicant’s reasons for appealing the initial decision. The letter should not simply repeat information that was presented in the application. If the basis for the appeal is a changed grade or an incorrectly reported test score, please provide documentation (such as a transcript or a revised score report) in the same envelope as your letter of appeal. Recommendations We recommend that you include copies of all high school and college transcripts. Letters of recommendation are not required. If letters are included, the limit is two. Submitting an Appeal Mail documents in a single envelope to: Admission Review Committee 1210 Cheadle Hall University of California, Santa Barbara Santa Barbara, CA 93106-2014 We appreciate your interest in UC Santa Barbara. Future Enrollment Options If an applicant remains interested in attending UCSB, the Office of Admissions staff will be pleased to assist them in planning for admission to a future term or as a transfer student. We offer a variety of services throughout the year for students planning to transfer. Opportunities for individual advising, virtual college fairs, online chats and in-person events can be found on our Webinars and Online Events and Virtual Tours pages. Please note: UCSB accepts only junior-level transfers and will give priority consideration to applicants from California community colleges. UCSB has established a Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) for fall terms with all California community colleges. Applicants should refer to the ASSIST website under articulation agreements by major for specific details on TAG agreements between UCSB and their community college. Also, please visit our Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) page for more detailed information. Appeal Process Tutorial Watch this brief tutorial explaining the UCSB Appeals Process.
