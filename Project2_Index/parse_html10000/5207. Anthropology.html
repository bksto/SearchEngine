Thus, anthropology is considered to be the most holistic of the social sciences. The goal of anthropology is to answer the question, “What is humankind?” from a biological, prehistoric, and behavioral perspective. The integrative approach to the discipline links anthropology with the life and social sciences, and has strong ties with disciplines ranging from biology and psychology to political science, history, and the arts, providing a humanistic perspective. Anthropology is particularly suited to persons with a wide range of interests as well as offering specific insights to others in more specialized disciplines. The study of anthropology offers preparation for careers in teaching, law enforcement, medicine and health care, and museums, to name just a few. Increasingly, business and industry leaders are employing anthropologists in key positions because their holistic perspective and broad cultural understanding prepare them to address modern-day challenges.
