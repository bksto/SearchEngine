This goal took form on a grand scale at the ANHW’s first signature event on December 3, a panel discussion cosponsored by the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA) entitled “Beyond Balance: Women’s Challenges and Choices in the 21st Century” (listen to audio from the event). Speaking in front of more than 200 people in a full lecture hall at the Science Center, a cross-disciplinary faculty panel featuring Barbara Kellerman, Jane Mansbridge, Lakshmi Ramarajan, and Caroline Light discussed new research and ongoing concerns about the role of women in leadership positions, in media coverage, and at home.  Following the successful event, ANHW President Acey Welch AB ’53 and Secretary Alexa Ing Stern AB ’12 discussed the panel, their respective experiences as Harvard and Radcliffe women, and the future of ANHW. Q: How did ANHW get started?  Acey Welch (AW): At our 35th Reunion, my classmates in the Class of 1953 had a class discussion. Our main topic was: Is Harvard still as sexist today as it was when we were students? We had a charge to research this question and report back in five years at our next Reunion, which we did. We felt that things really hadn’t improved all that much. The Class of ’58, at their 35th Reunion, was involved in the same conversation, so we connected and that was the birth of the Committee for the Equality of Women at Harvard.  Fast forward to the present day. We felt that our progress was glacial and there was still a lot to do, but it wasn’t going to be within that particular organization so we decided to dissolve. We talked about uniting Harvard women alums in a network and giving women a voice to pursue leadership and discuss issues of interest, and we decided a Shared Interest Group was the way to go.  Alexa Ing Stern (AS):I saw an email that ANHW was looking for a secretary so I emailed Acey. When she told me more about the group, what really hooked me was the diversity. As an undergrad, I was the president of The Seneca, Inc., which is not affiliated with the University but is a social organization comprised of Harvard students and alumnae that focuses on women’s advocacy. Since graduating, I am still very involved with The Seneca, but while The Seneca and other women’s groups on campus are wonderful networks, they are also very young. The Seneca is just over 15 years old, so the oldest alums are only 15 years older than I am. What’s really interesting about ANHW is that it’s truly multigenerational. Q: What were your impressions of Beyond Balance?  AW: When we were talking about the numbers we were expecting to attend, Jane Mansbridge was appalled that we had such a large room and felt it would be deflating to see just this little group of people. I teased her about it as we sat there looking at this full, sold-out event. That would not have happened without the support of the HAA. AS: I think you can tell how well received it was just based on the fact that nobody wanted the conversation to end, even after the event was over. What struck me was that even these professors—whose careers are studying these topics—didn’t have an easy answer. On the face of it a lot of progress has been made, so it’s easy to hold up those successes and ignore whatever remnants of sexism do remain. AW: I agree and I think the panelists effectively brought out this complexity. There is interest and enthusiasm and a need to continue the discussion. Q: What was your experience like as a woman at Harvard? AW: I majored in architectural sciences. It was a very small major; there were roughly 20 students (four women) in my class. I felt no discrimination at all. Everybody was treated the same. I think for some of my classmates who majored in English or history, in big sections probably many of the women were hesitant to raise their hands and say anything. But I never experienced that. AS: I have very few negative things to say about my time at Harvard. In terms of the academics, I didn’t feel I was ever being discriminated against or at a disadvantage based on my gender. This may have been different for women in different departments, so I think other women in my class would have a very wide range of experiences and opinions. Unfortunately, in many social environments on campus, women are still very much at a disadvantage at Harvard, which is something that we all need to work on correcting. It’s so interesting to hear about women not being able to go into Lamont Library, or having to eat somewhere else, or how the female faculty had to use the back door of the Faculty Club. I knew that things had been like that, but it’s funny that I can talk to somebody who had that experience. It’s shocking to realize just how recent all of these changes are. It’s pretty stunning to see the changes that have happened in just two generations. The thing that is difficult—going back to the problems now being more subtle and nuanced—is that the rate of change has really slowed. Q: What about in your life after Harvard?  AW: I had a professional career, which was unusual because not many women coming out of a liberal arts education had an entrée into professional life without a graduate school degree. I started out as a technical illustrator and advanced to a graphic artist. My first job was basically all women because the boss felt they were better suited for pen-and-ink work. In hindsight, that was obviously a bit sexist!  When my first child was on the way, I had to resign. In that era you had to quit at the seventh month. There was no holding your job, or much thought of going back to work. While my kids were growing up I had my own freelance business. When I decided to go back to work full time, it was not easy to reenter. I opted to use a temp service and stayed with my third assignment, a geotech firm, as a full-time employee for 18 years. That was interesting because then the guys were doing the pen-and-ink work, and women were coming in as engineers and geologists, particularly geologists because the head geologist liked to have a lot of women around—a bit sexist!  AS: I love my postgrad life, but so often I think Harvard was just this awesome little bubble! In my professional experience, the way some people interact with women is definitely different. Believe it or not, I’ve actually had people call me “sweetie”! I think workplace sexism is something that people don’t really talk about as undergrads, possibly because they don’t know it’s coming. Q: What does the future hold for ANHW?  AS: One of the things I’m excited to see evolve is the idea of a mentorship program. I think it’s great not just from a career advancement perspective, but to make a new friend and to get to know what Harvard was like for somebody else or what her postgrad experience was like. There are so many alums who want a way to engage with undergrads or other recent alums—I think that’s a void that ANHW could fill. AW: More and more people are getting interested. We have close to 125 new members that signed up because of this event and the follow-up messages are asking for further discussion, events, etc. One of the dreams I have, as we get certain areas where there’s a nucleus of members, is to have little subgroups that could meet face to face. I think the more we get people talking to each other, the easier it becomes to develop a vibrant group. It’s limitless as to the direction it could go. I would just like to see it flourish.
