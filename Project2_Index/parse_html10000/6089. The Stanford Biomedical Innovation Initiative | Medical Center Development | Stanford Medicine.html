Over the last 60 years, our unrivaled atmosphere of interdisciplinary exploration and collaboration has produced many of the innovations that sparked this revolution: MRIs, gene splicing, and stem cell medicine were all born on our campus. Today, that same atmosphere, amplified by the astounding intellectual, technological, and financial capital that surrounds us in Silicon Valley, gives us an unprecedented opportunity. Together, in this place and at this moment, we have the chance to change human health forever. The Biomedical Innovation Initiative is a collection of philanthropic investments in disruptive research, visionary faculty, and promising young scientists. With this targeted, flexible funding, we will drive biomedical innovation forward around the world. Through the generosity of our philanthropic partners, we will power a simple idea, proven time and again on our campus: when you set the best minds free to explore to the limits of their talent and imagination, they will deliver a brighter, better future. Read on, and you’ll discover just a few examples of the kinds of innovation your philanthropic vision can fuel.    We don’t think outside the box because we never see one to begin with.
