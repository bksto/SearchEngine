Most recently, he's been in the news for fathering a baby with a model who was not his girlfriend, much to the chagrin of the model who is (was) his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran. And he's still in trouble for his visit to the Bay Area in January, when five people were shot and wounded following the R&B-pop star's gig at a South San Jose nightclub. The incident prompted a judge to revoke Brown's probation, and he faces a hearing March 20 to determine what happens to him as a result. Jail time is a possibility.

The 25-year-old Virginia native returned to San Jose on Friday, performing before a capacity crowd of 12,000-plus fans at the SAP Center. It was part of the singer's co-headlining Between the Sheets Tour with Trey Songz. Brown never mentioned the earlier shooting during Friday's roughly two-hour main set, which he shared -- a la Jay Z and Justin Timberlake on 2013's Legends of Summer tour -- with the 30-year-old Songz. Yet, it's pretty clear that the situation was still fresh in some people's minds. Advertisement Police presence outside the venue was at a level I don't believe I've witnessed before during my countless trips to the SAP Center. There were even private security guards brought in to help monitor the grounds. Metal detectors were also used as fans entered the building. All of those extra measures didn't put a damper on the crowd's enthusiasm. The audience -- which was probably 80 percent female -- was in the mood to party and swoon. And Brown and Songz proved capable of making both happen. The show kicked off with a short set by Tyga, the rapper who collaborated with Brown on the newly released "Fan of a Fan: The Album." Then Songz took the stage, delivering one soulless slow jam after another. The show provided very little insight into why Songz is so popular. His voice was fine, but certainly no better than that, and his slow jams tended to be as awkward as they were overwrought. The lyrics were rich with cliches, selling romance like some sexed-up line of dollar-store greeting cards. Some of the songs -- such as the gooey, goofy "Cake" -- were so bad they were almost good. Yet, it didn't seem Songz or his fans were in on the joke. He performed roughly 30 minutes before handing the mic to Brown, who quickly raced through such marginally likable cuts as "Came to Do," "Wall to Wall" and the title track to his sixth solo studio album, "X." Brown is certainly fun to watch onstage, as he boogies and bops to prerecorded beats. He's a good dancer, yet he tends to repeat the same or similar moves over and over again. It's definitely not like witnessing Usher in concert. Brown and Songz traded places yet again, with Songz returning for a few numbers. Then came the evening's main selling point, as the two multiplatinum performers performed together onstage. Yet, the best moment was when the Bay Area's longtime hip-hop legend E-40 waltzed into view and rapped through a short set with Brown. E-40's performance was, without a doubt, the best moment of the night. Too bad he didn't stick around longer. The show closed with the Brown smash "Loyal," which seemed like an ironic choice given the news about what allegedly spurred the singer's girlfriend to break up with him. Chalk it up as yet another sign that Brown's real-world troubles don't translate to the stage. Follow Jim Harrington at twitter.com/jimthecritic and www.facebook.com/jim.bayareanews.
