Hines College of Architecture established a new degree of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design in 2003, becoming the first of its kind in a four-state region covering Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and New Mexico. The Industrial Design program emerged from an established and respected university in one of the largest and most dynamic urban centers: Houston. The resources and environment provided an ideal learning context for the discipline of Industrial Design with resources unique to the metro area, such as NASA, the Texas Media Center, and diverse industrial entities. “The Industrial Design program is rapidly taking its place as the premier program in the four state regions. Its award-winning students and faculty add an additional layer of rigor to the college’s platform of integrated disciplines: Architecture, Interior Architecture, and Industrial Design. The degree program in Industrial Design focuses on applied research, critical thinking, technology, and the art of making. Its curriculum emphasizes generative and discovery-oriented learning. Attention to craft and design innovation is further enhanced by a premier digital fabrication facility, the Burdette Keeland Design Exploration Center.” - Dean Patricia Belton Oliver, FAIA Philosophy The emerging context of education in the development of digital information technology can be summarized and characterized by the keywords of accessible, flexible, virtual, ubiquitous, connected, collaborative, authentic, and learner-centered. This conceptual frame for understanding the world can be linked to design education and practice. The education model for the Industrial Design program at the Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture focuses on addressing a new structure of learning by connecting and integrating design knowledge in new, useful, and meaningful ways for the student. The ID program emphasizes the learner’s generative and discovery-oriented learning, explained in the following design pedagogy: 1. Integrated Learning Today’s rapidly changing world demands that Industrial Design students possess a broad base of cross-boundary knowledge and skills enabling them to deal with complex problems more effectively. Integrated learning clarifies the blurred boundaries between design studies and design activities, which include a wide spectrum of social acts and its process. 2. Collaborative Learning Collaborative learning is defined as a learning process that emphasizes cooperative efforts between instructors and students. Collaborative learning is an important cognitive strategy based on the social construction of knowledge, which leads to deeper processing and understanding than learning without collaboration. 3. Project-oriented Learning Design learning emphasizes process-oriented problem solving as reflective practice. The practical and pragmatic aspect of design knowledge can be enhanced by a series of workshops and industry sponsored projects. Implementing design knowledge comes from “learning by doing.” Degree Plan The program for the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design degree is a four-year curriculum of at least 132 semester hours. The degree includes the university’s required core curriculum and 3 hours of elective courses. Because of the mutual and overlapping bonds of Architecture, Interior Architecture and Industrial Design, the programs share a common first semester curriculum. Students interested in the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design should follow the procedure for application to the College of Architecture.
