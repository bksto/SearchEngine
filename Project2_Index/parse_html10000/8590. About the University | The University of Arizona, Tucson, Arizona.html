We aren't afraid to ask big questions, and find even better answers.   We're innovators and discoverers. In 1885, establishing Arizona's first university in the middle of the Sonoran Desert was a bold move. But our founders were fearless, and we have never lost that spirit. To this day, we're revolutionizing the fields of space sciences, optics, biosciences, medicine, arts and humanities, business, technology transfer and many others. Since it was founded, the UA has grown to cover more than 380 acres in central Tucson, a rich breeding ground for discovery. Where else in the world can you find an astronomical observatory mirror lab under a football stadium? An entire ecosystem under a glass dome? Visit our campus, just once, and you'll quickly understand why the UA is a university unlike any other. Here, "Bear Down" is more than just a motto. Before UA student body president and revered football quarterback John "Button" Salmon died in 1926, his last words to his teammates were "Tell them ... tell the team to bear down." Whether it's academics, athletics or research, we've adopted the stance that when the going gets tough, the tough #BearDown. Our curiosity knows no bounds. As a leading-edge public research university, we're inspired to explore humanity's most fundamental questions - about science, medicine, the arts and business. Our faculty includes members of esteemed national academies, Pulitzer Prize winners, White House Champions of Change and celebrated thought leaders in numerous disciplines. We are leading projects that will change how we see the world, such as the OSIRIS-REx mission, which will scoop samples from a near-Earth asteroid in 2020. We're partners with the community. Whether we're teaming up with local schools to improve K-12 education, or working with rural communities to improve the health of residents, we're helping society meet its grand challenges. The UA's Tech Parks are where dynamic innovators and business leaders work side by side to test and develop new technologies. The UA Medical Center, part of the UA Health Network, is a 479-bed hospital that has been ranked among the nation's best hospitals by U.S. News & World Report for more than a decade. Together, the UA, UA Tech Parks and the UA Health Network generate billions of dollars of economic activity in Arizona each year-$8.3 billion in 2011 alone. Our graduates are workforce-ready. At the UA, 100 percent of our undergraduates will have the opportunity to apply the knowledge they learn in the classroom in the real-world, through internships, community service, on-campus jobs and research opportunities. Our mission is to graduate students who are sought after by the best employers and postgraduate programs, and who are ready to embark on engaging, fulfilling careers. Equipped with skills, knowledge, experience and the entrepreneurial spirit they gain at the UA, our students become highly skilled members of society who lead with determination, innovate without limits and create companies that generate more jobs, benefitting our state, our nation and the world, in boundless ways. Our alumni include astronauts and actors; Grammy, Tony, Emmy and Oscar winners; media stars; Olympic athletes; Fortune 500 CEOs; public servants; Nobel scientists; inventors and best-selling authors. We're thinkers and doers. From the heart of the Southwest to the edges of the universe, there are no limits to how far we can reach. We'll never stop pushing to make sense of the world and to find ways to make it better. At the University of Arizona, we have the power to make a difference. Bigger Questions. Better Answers. Bear Down.     #10 Our history runs deep. Before Arizona was a state, there was the University of Arizona. # 9 A premier, public research university.

The UA Health Networks helps treat more than 100,000 patients each year, and the UA Medical Center houses the only Level I trauma center in Southern Arizona. # 7 Creativity flourishes here. Iconic photographer Ansel Adams helped found the UA's Center for Creative Photography, the largest institution in the world devoted to documenting the history of modern North American photography. # 6 We transform ideas into reality. Researchers at the UA's BIO5 Institute develop and commercialize new technologies, diagnostics and health care treatments, and have helped form 20 spinoff companies in the past eight years. # 5 The best and the brightest internationally. The UA is one of the nation's top producers of Fulbright Scholars. # 4 Our economic influence is felt statewide.
