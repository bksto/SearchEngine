The Hammer Museum is like no other museum in the world. Located physically and metaphorically at the gateway between the city of Los Angeles and UCLA, the Hammer is a joyful celebration of art in every imaginable—or never-before imagined—form. If it's classical, contemporary or cutting-edge, videotaped, filmed, painted, sculpted or even spoken, it's at the Hammer. Not just a museum but a cultural center as well, the Hammer is a vibrant intellectual forum for the exploration of cultural, political and social issues and ideas. It's a place where you can find street art hanging along the stairways; an exhibition of comic book graphics; a video meditation on a provocative theme; a dialog with luminaries such as playwright and screenwriter David Mamet, comedian Patton Oswalt or artist Tom Morello; or a magnificently restored film screening in The Billy Wilder Theater, home to the Hammer's public programs and the world-renowned UCLA Film & Television Archive. The Fowler Museum at UCLA is the world in art. This museum showcases global arts and cultures—from time-honored traditions to new productions by international contemporary artists—with an emphasis on works from Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas. Explore your planet and the lives of the people you share it with through the Fowler's dynamic exhibitions, award-winning publications and engaging public programs. Whether it's a color-drenched journey through the tradition of Carnival around the world, life and death in Haitian art, Tibetan Buddhist printing, the Chicano art movement in Los Angeles or the drama of Nigerian sculpture, the Fowler takes you where few other museums venture, and it enriches and entertains every visitor it welcomes to its home on the UCLA campus. The UCLA Film and Television Archive is the nation's second-largest moving image collection behind only the Library of Congress. Screenings of its treasure trove of footage not only enlighten the study of film and television, but also enrich the UCLA and Los Angeles experience.
