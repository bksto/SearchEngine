When you submit your online application, you will be provided information on what type of disability verification to provide, and who to schedule an appointment with. Please print out this page for your records. Provide DSP with verification of your disability in advance of your "intake appointment" with a Disability Specialist. Initiate a request to schedule an appointment with a Disability Specialist for an intake interview by calling or contacting the DSP receptionist. The DSP phone number is 510-642-0518. Meet with your Disability Specialist during your "intake appointment", to discuss the accommodations or services you may be eligible to receive. After you have been approved for accommodations and services by your Disability Specialist, request accommodation letters and auxiliary services online. Make this request at the beginning of each semester in which you will require accommodation letters or auxiliary services. You must initiate and complete these five (5) steps before you may be approved for DSP services. If you are unable to complete the online application process, you can request assistance in person from the DSP receptionist. Departments To request test proctoring for students with disabilities in your classes who have Letters of Accommodation from the Disabled Students’ Program, see Campus Proctoring Services.
