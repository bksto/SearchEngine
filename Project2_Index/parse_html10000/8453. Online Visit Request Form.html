Prospective Students University of Redlands > Prospective Students > High School Students & Guidance Counselors > Visiting the Redlands Campus > Online Visit Request Form Online Visit Request Form This form must be completed in Internet Explorer©. Use of other browsers may result in your request not be received by our office. If you are requesting a Campus Tour and/or Admissions Meeting or are interested in having a day visit or overnight visit you may complete and submit this form.  If you are requesting only a tour and/or admissions appointment, some of the questions will not be applicable. A day visit can include visiting a class, meeting with a professor and/or coach as well as a campus tour and an appointment with an admissions counselor. An overnight visit can include all the above in addition to an overnight stay. We will work hard to make the requested appointments and arrangements, however please understand that sometimes scheduling conflicts occur. We require three weeks notice to schedule your visit. Once your form is submitted, you will be contacted by our office to finalize your visit.  It can take a few days for us to process requests, especially during our peak seasons, so please be patient.  Please do not arrange additional meetings or tours for yourself until you have spoken with our visit coordinator, as this can cause confusion and double-bookings.
