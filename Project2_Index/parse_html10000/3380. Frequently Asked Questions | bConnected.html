Yes; please see How to Respond to Requests for Electronic Information for more details. However, there are certain limits, as described in the above     question, “So the government can look at my email?” Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top Does UCB have a published procedure for law enforcement to follow when making a request? Yes; Please see Approval to Access Berkeley Campus Electronic Communications for more information. Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top Does UCB commit to tell users when an order has come in from a subpoena unless there's a gag order? Yes, per ECP Section IV.B.3, “Notification: The responsible authority or designee shall at the earliest opportunity that is lawful and consistent with other University policy notify the affected individual of the action(s) taken and the reasons for the action(s) taken.” The notification requirements are applicable for subpoenas and other non-consensual access (including internal requests). Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top What should I do if I want to get non-consensual access to someone’s account? You need to fill out the following form: Campus Approval of Non-Consensual Access to Electronic Communication Records (PDF). Once you do, you will find out if your request was approved or denied. Also, see below for the process for law enforcement requests. Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top So the government can look at my email? There are limits to bConnected transparency. For example, the US security apparatus, with their ability to serve Google with gag-order National Security Letters, can bypass the University without us being able to engage via an understandable legal process. Also, unencrypted email traverses the Internet in plaintext, which can be intercepted and read by third-parties. It’s true that some users with serious privacy requirements want to know about how to keep email truly confidential using encrypted communications with corporate or nation-state adversaries. Information on this is beyond the scope of this webpage, but we encourage you to educate yourself through the following sources: The Committee to Protect Journalist’s Journalist Security Guide; Surveillance Self Defense website, and the Email Self Defense website. Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top Under what circumstances might someone other than UCB look at my email without me knowing? The bConnected team sometimes gets requests from government, law enforcement, or internal campus authorities asking for access without the record holders knowledge or consent. When required by law or UC policy to comply with such a request, we will do so. Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top Do systems administrators look through my email? System administrators have access to campus email accounts, but they use principles of “least perusal”, and only access accounts when it’s absolutely necessary to maintain stability of operations or assist users who have asked them to investigate problems. Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top What is the difference between the Transparency Report and the annual report required by the Electronic Communications Policy? Our Transparency Report provides more detailed information than the ECP requires. It’s also specific to UC Berkeley, and not other UC campuses.  Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top What is the The UC Electronic Communications Policy (ECP)? The ECP is a system-wide document that establishes policy on allowable use and privacy of electronic communications, and also clarifies limits on privacy protections. Category:  Transparency FAQs Back to Top Tips and Tricks Presentation On April 19, 2013, the monthly BPAWG meeting featured a bConnected Tips Discussion. (total run time ~1 hr 10 minutes). Highlights: Dave Nguyn of UHS presents Favorite bMail Labs undo send (10:00 - 15:25) canned response (16:00 - 18:45) preview pane (19:26 - 20:52) Category:  bConnected Tips & Tricks Back to Top Get an email when a form response is submitted When you use Drive to create a form or survey, you can also set up an automatic notification to let you know when a new response is submitted. Open the form you've created, click the Tools menu at the top of the form, and select Notification rules...There are several options -- select 'when a user submits a form' and how often you'd like to be notified. You'll automatically get a message in your bMail inbox to let you know a new response has come in. Category:  bConnected Tips & Tricks Back to Top Create a Contacts group from an email list Perhaps you've received an email with multiple recipients and you want to capture that group as a Contact list for meetings, document sharing, or other emails. You don't need to re-enter every name individually. Simply copy the email addresses of all the recipients, open Contacts, and click New Group on the left side. Name your new group and paste the list into group. Your new Contacts group is ready to use in all your bConnected tools -- simply enter the group name in the 'To' field. This video provides step by step instructions on creating a new group from an email (video length 3:23).   Category:  bConnected Tips & Tricks Back to Top Meeting sign-in becomes a contact list Ask meeting or event attendees to add themselves to a Contacts list as they arrive. It's faster than a paper sign-in sheet (campus attendees' names/contact info is already in bConnected) and eliminates deciphering handwriting and possible typos later. After the event, emailing follow-up information is simple: just type the Contact list name in the 'bcc' field in bMail. Scheduling a follow-up meeting is simple, too:  invite all the prior attendees by typing the list name in the Add Guests field when creating an event in bCal.
