There is a narrative behind why someone chooses to give his or her time, talents and resources to support the mission and the people of UC Davis. Through this series we are honored to share one hundred of these stories. These are chronicles of individuals, couples and families among thousands of alumni, faculty, staff, friends and students. Their gifts came in all sizes, but all tell a tale of promise, change, inspiration, gratitude and hope. These profiles represent the 100,000-plus donors who were inspired to give to UC Davis through its first comprehensive fundraising campaign, together raising more than $1 billion. We invite you to read, enjoy and share the accounts of these people who have transformed UC Davis and made a difference in the lives of people throughout California and the world with their generosity. Together, these stories are the one story of The Campaign for UC Davis.
