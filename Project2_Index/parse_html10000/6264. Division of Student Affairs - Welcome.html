Welcome from the Vice President Student Affairs Transforms Lives is the start of a bold way forward and the beginning of our mission statement. The Student Affairs Division is key in transforming the lives of students by empowering them to achieve their greatest potential in their academic, personal, and professional lives at Cal State Fullerton. As a division we are influenced by our core values; student and learner-centeredness, integrity, diversity, collaboration, and excellence. Our strong values inspire us to work in conjunction with one another toward our goals of increasing student retention, providing exceptional advising, developing comprehensive assessment plans, engaging in talent development efforts,enhancing the Titan Experience for the entire campus community, and successfully graduating students. Cross-divisional collaboration and implementation of high impact practices (HIPs) are essential in a time of increased accountability and transparency. Collaboration and implementation of HIPs are also critical as research shows that learning inside and outside the classroom advances student learning that provides knowledge and skills required for success at CSUF and the global society. With the diverse atmosphere present at CSUF it is fundamental to embrace students from all backgrounds. It is also important to be culturally relevant and sensitive in the resources and the college learning experience provided to students. In particular, to those students who have been historically marginalized and underrepresented in higher education. As a division we build on the strengths students bring to the institution to promote change, social responsibility, personal growth, empowerment and new ideas as well as provide opportunities for community involvement, multicultural experiences, leadership training, and career development. I am humbled to work with and for committed student affairs educators, scholars, and reflective practitioners who are dedicated to life-long learning, social justice and advocacy, and the holistic development and achievement of our students. This commitment can be seen from our student assistants to our Associate Vice Presidents. I invite you to explore the  programs and services   offered by our Student Affairs Division and to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have.
