With more than 1,000 clubs and student organizations, UCLA is a mosaic of culture and activity. And the majority of our students fill their schedules to capacity. They are influential figures at the Volunteer Center and leaders at the Center for Community Learning and Community Programs Office. They are intramural basketball players and sailors. They're active in fraternity and sorority life and coordinators on the Campus Events Commission. They're writers for the Daily Bruin and deejays at UCLA Radio. And when they're not engaging in extracurricular activities, there's an array of campus stores and restaurants for shopping and dining. Whatever you're into, chances are, someone here is too. Supported by a strong student government, UCLA's more than 42,000 students have the opportunity to determine their role in what happens on campus. The Undergraduate Students Association and the Graduate Student Association empower young students to allocate budgets, found new clubs and develop a campus that fully represents their interests.
