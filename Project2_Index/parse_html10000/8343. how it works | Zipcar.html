How do I join Zipcar? Apply online. It only takes a few minutes. Within 3-7 days, you'll receive a Zipcard in the mail. Your Zipcard is your ticket to any car in our network. How long does it take to become a member? Before you can drive, you'll need a Zipcard. Your Zipcard will arrive in the mail 3-7 days after you apply. If you want to drive sooner, you can pick up your Zipcard at a local Zipcar office. (Make sure to select this option on your application.) Either way, we'll also need to review your driving record before you're approved to drive. This process typically takes just a few hours, but in some cases, it may take a little longer: If you have a driver's license from outside the US or Canada, we can't check your record automatically. You will need to send it to us. See how to request your records. Do you have a US license issued in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or by the State Department? See how to request your records. Do you have a Canadian license issued in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec, Saskatchewan or the Yukon Territories? See how to request your records.

I have a US license from the State Department, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands. How do I obtain my driving record? For some licenses, we are unable to process driving history checks automatically online. If you have a US license from the State Department, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, you'll need to obtain your driving record and fax to us. Learn how. I have a Canadian license from Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec, Saskatchewan or the Yukon Territory. How do I obtain my driving record?

Can I join if I have a driver's license from outside the US or Canada? Thousands of foreign drivers use Zipcar. We accept drivers from every country. You will need to contact your country's vehicle records department to obtain an official copy of your driving record (translated into English), or if your country does not have a department of motor vehicles, you will need to contact your old automobile insurance provider and obtain adequate insurance documentation of driving history from them. Don't worry, it's not as daunting as it sounds.  More details:  How to obtain your foreign driving record expand all Reserving a Zipcar How do I reserve a Zipcar? You can reserve on the website or use the free iPhone® or Android™ app. You can also call 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR and have a rep make a reservation for you, but will be charged a $3.50 agent reservation charge. For how long can I book a Zipcar? You can reserve a Zipcar for as little as one hour, or as much as 7 days at a time. Whether it's a quick shopping trip or a full week of freedom, you can book in half-hour increments. If you'd like to keep a car for more than 7 days, you can call us and we'll try to help you out. Please understand that due to availability, location and other factors, we cannot guarantee reservations longer than 7 days. Can I book a one-way trip with Zipcar? We are currently testing out one-way reservations in Boston with a small set of cars. Learn more about Zipcar ONE>WAY in Boston. For all other reservations, you'll need to return your Zipcar to its home location at the end of your trip. How much mileage is included? Reservations include a minimum of 180 miles.* That means you can drive up to 180 miles during the course of your reservation and not get charged extra. If you drive more than that, here's how it breaks down. Reservations lasting 24 hours or shorter: 180 miles included $0.45 for each additional mile (up to $0.55 for premium vehicles and cargo vans) Reservations exceeding 24 hours: 180 miles included for each 24-hour period 20 miles included for each additional hour of your reservation until you reach 180 miles $0.45 for each additional mile (up to $0.55 for premium vehicles and cargo vans) For members on the Access rate plan, reservations include 100 miles. You can estimate extra mileage charges for a specific reservation from your confirmation page. Just click the "details" link next to the estimated cost. *Mileage included varies by country. Learn more about using Zipcars in other countries. What's the cancellation policy? For reservations that are less than 8 hours long, you can cancel or shorten your reservation up to 3 hours before the start time without charge. For reservations that are 8 hours or longer, you have to do it at least 24 hours in advance. If you don't cancel or shorten with the required advance notice, you're responsible for the full amount of the reservation. Note that there's a 30-minute window after you book your car where you can make any changes without incurring a charge. expand all Zipcar vehicles What types of vehicles can I drive? There are lots of models to choose from, so there's a Zipcar for your every whim. Cruise around in a MINI, haul stuff in a cargo van, visit clients in a BMW or be extra eco-savvy in a hybrid. So many possibilities! Please note that models vary by city. View Zipcars in your city. Do Zipcars have automatic or manual transmissions? All Zipcars in the US have automatic transmissions. Phew, right? If you reserve a Zipcar in another country, you may come across some with manual transmissions. If you prefer, you can filter your search to show only automatic cars. Learn more about using Zipcars in other countries. What are "hourly only" Zipcars? Some cities have hourly only cars. These little guys are reserved for short local trips, and they give members access to more Zipcars on short notice. If the daily rate appears as "N/A" on the reservation page, it's an hourly only car. There are no day rates available for these cars. Are any Zipcars equipped with hand controls? Yes, we do have hand controls available. Based on the needs of our current members, some regions already have them in place. In these regions, just give us a call at least 24 hours before your reservation so we make arrangements. In regions where they are not yet available, please give us 7 days notice. Learn more about our policy. What is Zipcar's recall policy? At Zipcar, we put the safety of our members first and we take all manufacturers' recalls very seriously. Periodically, automobile manufacturers provide notices of issues relating to their vehicles. These notices range from minor issues to serious problems that may pose a risk to the safety of the driver, passengers and the general public. In the United States, when Zipcar receives a safety recall notice from a vehicle manufacturer under the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, Zipcar identifies the affected vehicles in our fleet and removes them from our reservations system, which prevents them from being reserved. These vehicles cannot be used by our members until we are able to implement a remedy that has been approved by the manufacturer and the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). Members with future reservations on recalled vehicles will be moved to another car while the issue is addressed. expand all Driving How do I unlock a Zipcar? When you join, you are issued a Zipcard. (It's about the shape and size of a credit card.) At the time of your reservation, just hold your Zipcard against the card reader in the windshield. Hold it steady for a few seconds, and the doors will unlock. Once you've scanned in with your Zipcard, you can then either use your smartphone or your Zipcard to lock and unlock the doors throughout your reservation. We have apps for iPhone® or Android™. Where are the car keys? The key is waiting for you inside the car, attached to a tether on the steering column. The key should always remain inside the car. Use your Zipcard or smartphone to lock and unlock the doors throughout your reservation. Note that some car models have start buttons instead of keys. To start one of these cars, simply step on the brake, press the start button, and you're good to go. In some countries, the key is in the glove compartment. Learn more about driving Zipcars in other countries. Can I take the car early? If there's no reservation immediately before yours, you can take the car up to 14 minutes early at no extra charge. (If you enter the car 15 to 30 minutes prior, you will be billed for an additional half hour.) The doors will only unlock early if the car is available. If you can't get in, that means the car may still be reserved by the previous member. Simply wait until your reservation start time and try again. What if the car is damaged? Before you drive off, be sure to take a few minutes to do a thorough walk-around to see if there are any dents, scratches or other damage. Check the inside as well. If you notice any problems, call us at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR and report it. Please provide us with as much detail as possible, like the exact location of the damage, the approximate size of any dents or scratches, etc. You don't want to be held responsible for damage you didn't cause, so please don't forget to check at the start of every reservation. What if the car is dirty or low on fuel? Your Zipcar should be clean and have at least 1/4 tank of fuel when you arrive. It's all part of the rules. If there's a problem, we ask that you call us at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR and report it. If you'd like to take the car for a cleaning, you can pay for it and we'll reimburse your account up to $10. If you prefer, we'll do our best to move you to a different vehicle. Can I extend my reservation? Provided that another member does not have a reservation immediately after yours, you can extend using the iPhone® or Android™ app, SMS, mobile website or call 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR. What about tolls? For your convenience, we’ve added toll passes to Zipcars in many cities. There's no surcharge for using the passes — we'll just bill your account for the actual toll amount. Please note that it can take up to 3 weeks for toll charges to come in, so you will be billed separately from your reservation. Throughout Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York and many universities, cars are equipped with E-ZPass® toll passes. These work everywhere the E-ZPass logo is displayed. In Miami, Florida, cars are equipped with SunPass® toll passes. These can be used on most toll roads and bridges throughout Florida. However, they cannot be used at the toll to Key Biscayne or on the Venetian Causeway. In California, including many universities, cars are equipped with FasTrak® toll passes. These can be used on all toll roads throughout California, Bay Area bridges and future Express Lanes. In Washington state, including all universities, cars are equipped with Good To Go! passes. These can be used on the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, SR 167 HOT lanes and the SR 520 floating bridge. In Canada, tolls for highway 407 in Toronto and the Golden Ears Bridge and road network in Vancouver are charged electronically as you pass through them — there are no tollbooth attendants. We receive a monthly statement with toll charges and then bill the charges to your Zipcar account. In all the other cities you'll need to pay cash at the tollbooths. Personal toll passes If your Zipcar comes with a toll pass, don't try to use your own personal pass instead as this may confuse the system and result in double-charging. If you're in one of our cities that does not offer toll passes, you may use your own as long as you follow the rules and regulations set up by the toll authority. This means that you'll need to register the Zipcar on your account. If we receive notice of an unpaid toll, we'll have to redirect it to you, along with a penalty charge. Do you have roadside assistance? Yes, your Zipcar membership includes roadside assistance 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Just call us at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR and we will take care of the details. Can I take my pet in a Zipcar? Yes, but only when it's kept in a locked pet carrier. Many members are allergic to pet hair so if any happen to escape the pet carrier, please clean it up before your reservation comes to an end. Service animals used by disabled members or passengers with disabilities are an exception. These animals are allowed in the car without a pet carrier. If you need to bring a service animal into a Zipcar, please let us know by calling 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR so that we can clean the car for the next member. Can I smoke in a Zipcar? No, smoking damages the cars and can impact the health of other members. For any member found to be smoking in the car, we will charge you for the cost of cleaning the car to make it completely smoke free. Oh, and holding a cigarette outside the car while driving is STILL considered smoking in the car. Just so you know. Can someone else drive during my reservation? Only members can drive Zipcars. If you've got a fellow member along for the ride, it's ok to go ahead and share the driving time. You can also add family or friends to your account so they can drive too. Non-members are not covered by our insurance. If you allow a non-member to drive during your reservation, you will be responsible for repairs if damage occurs to the car while they're driving. You will lose your membership as well. Which is a bad thing. What if I leave (or find) something in my Zipcar? If you've left something in your Zipcar, you can re-enter the car within three hours of the end of your reservation to retrieve the item, as long as the car hasn't been reserved by someone else. Please don't start the vehicle, or you will be charged for the use. If it's outside the three-hour window, you should make a reservation for the next available hour to gain access to the Zipcar. If you find an item in a Zipcar, please place it in the glove compartment or trunk and give us a call at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR. Hopefully the member will return for their missing item. You can also post it in the online Lost & Found forum. What if I'm picking up my car from a garage with a valet? In some cities, cars are parked at garages with valets. If you're picking up your Zipcar from one of these garages, make sure you scan in and out, by holding your Zipcard over the card reader in the windshield — even if the doors are already open. This is how we know for sure when you've started and ended your reservation. Here are a few more things to know about garages with valets: Calling ahead Some garages request that you call prior to your reservation. If this applies to your reservation, you'll see a note and the garage's phone number on your reservation confirmation page. Waiting for your Zipcar If the garage is busy, sometimes you may have to wait to get your car, even if you've called ahead. If you have not scanned into your reservation by your scheduled start time, call us at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR and we will work with you to extend your reservation or credit you accordingly for lost time. Resolving issues with your reservation If there's a problem with your reservation or vehicle, please call Zipcar. While garage attendants have a good working relationship with Zipcar, they are employed by the garage — not by Zipcar. If you have an issue, the attendant may not be able to assist you in the same way that a Zipcar rep can. Tipping garage attendants If the garage attendant was kind, courteous, did the job well and you wish to extend gratitude, they will appreciate the gesture. The choice to give a gratuity for service is a personal one, and certainly yours to make. Can I use a valet service during my reservation? You cannot use a valet service at a restaurant or other parking location that's not authorized by Zipcar. The only time you can use a valet is if the car's home location has a garage attendant. Can I park in commercial zone during my reservation? In some cities, Zipcars have commercial plates. Unfortunately, these vehicles get all the drawbacks that come with commercial plates (like higher tolls and restricted access to certain roads) without any of the benefits. Please avoid commercial zone parking areas, or you'll be a sweet target for a parking ticket. What if I get a ticket during my reservation? We'll cover gas and insurance, but you are responsible for legal infractions. If we receive a notice and process a violation, you will be charged a $30 processing fee in addition to the original cost of the ticket. Report it. Call us right away at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR or email violations@zipcar.com and let us know that you received a ticket. Whether you've paid it, or decided to appeal it, we want a record of what's happening. We want to know the date and time the violation was issued, the license plate of the vehicle, the type of violation (speeding, parking, etc), the ticket #, how much it is for and what city gave it to you. This way if something goes wrong in the payment process, or you encounter glitches, we'll know you've got it covered and we won't just assume you tossed it in the gutter. Note that certain violations may impact insurance coverage, so it's very important to report any violation to Zipcar. What if I don't pay it? If you do not pay a ticket, we will be notified and charge you a $30 processing fee. Additionally, you are responsible for the cost of the ticket. If we can, we will redirect the violation to you. If we can't redirect it, we will pay the fine, along with any late fees and bill the total to your account. Other fines or membership suspension can also result, so please pay the ticket when you get it. Can I dispute it? If you wish to contest a violation and the issuing municipality allows it, be sure to do so promptly! If we receive a notice in the mail, and you have yet to dispute the ticket with the issuing municipality, we will automatically bill your account for the amount of the violation, plus the processing fee. What if I'm in an accident with my Zipcar? Take a deep breath and follow these steps: Call the emergency services if there are any injuries, damage to either vehicle involved, or if you believe you are not at fault. Having a police report is your best defense during an insurance investigation. If the police will not come to the scene, be sure to ask them why and let us know their reason. Then call us at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR to tell us there's been an accident. Collect the following information: If someone was injured, note whether a the individual was taken from the scene in an ambulance, and find out which hospital they were taken to. Record when (date and time) and where the incident happened. Get the contact details for all parties involved, including the driver's name (and vehicle owner, if different from the driver), phone number, address, license number, insurance company and policy number, vehicle registration plate number and vehicle identification number (VIN). If there was damage to an object (fence, sign, post, etc), get the contact information of the owner. Protect your version of the incident: Take pictures of all damage and the scene of the accident. This is very important for any insurance claim that might be filed. Get independent witnesses. Your passengers, family and friends do not count as independent witnesses. If any other bystanders witnessed the incident, ask for their contact details and get them to write down what they saw. Take note if any party apologizes or accepts responsibility for the incident. If possible, get it in writing and notify us of this information. You can even call us at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR and put the other party on the phone with us. Once you're back home safe and sound, we'll need some documentation about the incident. See details. If you have completed steps 1 through 5, then go do something nice for yourself. After all, you did everything you could just the way we needed you to. Unfortunately your Zipcar membership will be suspended until we obtain all of the details about the accident. For insurance purposes, we have to complete a thorough investigation, but you will be notified as soon as your account is reinstated. This process usually takes about two weeks. You can always email accidents@zipcar.com if you have any questions or call your local office. expand all Gassing up your Zipcar Who pays for gas? We do! You just need to fill the tank using the fuel card inside the car when it gets to 1/4 full. (Or is it 3/4 empty? Whichever.) The Zipcar gas policy is included in our 6 simple rules and it's how we make sure everybody starts off their trip right. How do I put gas in the Zipcar? Fuel is on us! You'll find the gas card in the driver's sun visor. To fill up, you’ll need to enter the vehicle's mileage (the odometer reading on the dash). You'll also need the first six digits of your Zipcard number. (For you long-time members who have Zipcard numbers that are less than six digits long, add zeros to the beginning to make six digits. Like this: Zipcard number 12345 becomes 012345.) Watch a short video on how to fill up. Always check your car details or the inside of the gas cap to ensure you add the correct fuel type — mistakes can be expensive! In some countries, the fuel card is in a different spot inside the car. Learn more about driving Zipcars in other countries. What if the gas card isn't accepted? While most gas stations take our fuel card, you may run into one that doesn't accept it. Go ahead and pay for it, and we'll reimburse you. We're good like that. expand all Returning your Zipcar Where do I return the Zipcar when I am done? Return the Zipcar to its home location. If you're at a location that has more than one reserved Zipcar space, any of them will do. Need a reminder of the car's home location? Directions are available on your reservation confirmation and in the mobile apps. What if the Zipcar space is taken or blocked? Call us at 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR and we'll work with you to find a nearby parking space. If there's another car in the Zipcar spot, please make a note of the make, model, and number plate of the unfortunate offender so that we can have them towed away. How do I end my reservation? Please remember to take all your belongings, remove any trash, and leave at least 1/4 tank of fuel for the next member. Be sure to lock up with your Zipcard and leave the keys inside the car. (Even if you're returning the car to a location that has a valet service, make sure to scan out.) Do I get credit for returning the car early? No. While the Zipcar is reserved in your name, no other member can reserve it during that time, so we do not offer credit for an early return. What happens if I return the car late? If you return your car late, you will be charged late fees starting at $50. Timely returns are really important in the world of car sharing. If someone returns a car late, then the next member can't start their reservation on time. We’ll have to find them another car, and sometimes we'll even have to put them in a taxi to get to it. So you can see why we need to have late fees. We're not trying to be mean, we're just trying to make sure that members get their cars when they need them. Here are a few tips to help avoid late return fees: Sign up for Zipcar Text Alerts. We'll send you reminders about your reservation, and also let you know if you can extend your trip. When you reserve your car, make sure you allow enough time for your entire trip. Think about travel time (there and back) and the amount of time you'll spend at your destination. Go ahead and book a little extra if you're not sure. Leave your destination on time. If it took you an hour to get there, most likely it's going to take you an hour to get back. Allow some cushion for traffic delays too. If at any time during your reservation you realize that you won't be able to get the Zipcar back on time, you can always try to extend your reservation from your smartphone or call 1‑866‑4ZIPCAR. If there's not another reservation immediately after yours, you can extend. If someone is waiting for the car, we will need to make other arrangements for them, so please call us as soon as you can. What happens if I return the car dirty or with low fuel? You are responsible for returning the car with at least 1/4 tank of fuel and in good condition for the next member. Not following these rules could result in a fine. Learn more. expand all Insurance and damage What's the insurance coverage? Every member in good standing who complies with the membership contract is covered while driving a Zipcar. Here are the highlights: Third party auto liability coverage* Members age 21+ who joined Zipcar March 1, 2015 or after receive liability coverage of 100/300/25 ($100,000 bodily injury per person, $300,000 bodily injury maximum, $25,000 property damage). Members under the age of 21 receive coverage up to the minimum financial responsibility limits required in the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs. Members age 21+ who joined Zipcar prior to March 1, 2015 receive liability coverage of $300,000 CSL (combined single limit) per accident. Members who joined Zipcar with a university and are age 21+ receive either 100/300/25 or $300,000 CSL, depending on the school’s agreement with Zipcar. If you have questions about your coverage please email insurance@zipcar.com. We provide Personal Injury Protection (PIP), or "no-fault" coverage, at the level required by the jurisdiction in which the accident occurs. Members are responsible for a $1,000 damage fee per incident, which can be reduced or eliminated with the purchase of an optional damage fee waiver. *Please note that coverage may be provided under a certificate of self-insurance, insurance policy, or both. For the full scoop on third party auto liability insurance, check out the member contract. Making a reservation outside of the US? Note that the coverage provided varies depending on where you drive. Learn more about driving Zipcars in other countries. What is a damage fee and when does it apply? Insurance is included, but if you happen to be involved in an incident with your Zipcar, a damage fee of up to $1,000 may apply. A damage fee can apply for dents, scratches, collisions, flat tires, windshield cracks, dead batteries (from leaving the lights on), engine problems, vandalism, theft, third party damages and, in some cases, third party personal injuries. If a sufficiently insured third party is found to be 100% at-fault, then the Zipcar member would not be responsible for the damage fee. Members are also not responsible for normal wear and tear on the vehicle. However, the fee does apply to damage caused by unavoidable events such as floods, hail, wind, trees falling, etc. Before each reservation, we ask you to check the car inside and out and report any damage. This ensures that you will not be held responsible for damage that may have happened before your reservation. Will my credit card cover my damage fee? Some credit cards include rental car insurance, which covers you when you use a rental car. Sometimes Zipcars fall under this coverage. Give them a call to see if they'll cover you in a Zipcar. If you are covered by your credit card, make sure to use it to pay for your reservations. You can update your credit card info here. If you've been in an accident while driving a Zipcar and you've filed a claim with your credit card company, they will want to see documentation from Zipcar. Please email accidents@zipcar.com to request this documentation. Will my personal auto insurance cover my damage fee? When driving Zipcars in North America, your personal insurance might cover you. Many personal auto insurance policies also provide coverage for rentals. But some policies contain loopholes too. Read your policy or contact your insurance agent to get the full scoop. Note that personal policies generally do not apply when driving Zipcars in Europe. Can I purchase a damage fee waiver? If you're age 21+, and have had no Zipcar accidents in the past 12 months, you are eligible to purchase a waiver. A waiver allows you to reduce or eliminate the damage fee. Purchasing a waiver won't change your insurance coverage—it just changes the maximum amount you'll be charged if you're involved in an incident with your Zipcar. A damage fee waiver becomes effective on the purchase date. Waivers are non-refundable. What happens during an accident investigation? Your first responsibility is to fill out an Incident Report form. Please fill out the form as soon as possible. You may also send other supporting documentation (pictures, police reports, etc)  to us via whatever method is the easiest (and fastest) for you: Email: accidents@zipcar.com Zipcar, Inc. Attention: Accident Reports 35 Thomson Place Boston, MA 02210 Sometimes it will take longer than a week to get the Police Report from the station, please send in your version of the accident on our Incident Report Form so we have your statement as early in the process as possible. Then, once the Police Report is available, please forward that to us. Sometimes the police will not make out a report because the accident doesn't meet their criteria. If that's the case, please let us know. If you believe anything was unusual or you have some concerns (for example, maybe there was pre-existing damage), let us know immediately. The local Zipcar office will inspect the vehicle for damages and bring the vehicle to a repair shop to get pictures and an estimate. If an insurance claim is necessary, one will be filed with the appropriate company. If you receive any communications from the other party or their insurer, please notify us as quickly as possible with their information (including company name, adjuster name, claim number, and phone number). You will be notified via email when all the steps of the investigation are complete and, based on the estimate of damage we receive from our repair shop, and whether or not a damage fee applies. Our policy in the case of an accident or vandalism is to suspend your membership until we have been provided with all of the information. When all the documentation and necessary steps outlined above have been completed, the suspension will be lifted. This process should take less than two weeks. Please email accidents@zipcar.com if you have any questions regarding the status of the investigation. What happens if there is an insurance claim? There are two kinds of insurance claims that you should know about with Zipcar. 1. Subrogation: If a subrogation claim is initiated, this means that based on your incident report, we believe there is a chance that you are not responsible for the accident and we are therefore pursuing another party for payment for the Zipcar damages and loss of use. If at any time you want more information regarding the claim or if you recall additional important details regarding your accident, please contact us at accidents@zipcar.com or reply to any of our emails regarding the incident. Understand that if the insurance company finds you to be responsible in any way for the incident, the claim is denied, or there is no insurance coverage by the other party, the damage fee may apply. However, remember that you have great coverage with Zipcar, so we'll cover the cost of the damages beyond the damage fee. However, rest assured that we will notify you in advance if the case seems to be veering out of your favor. Usually these cases are resolved within a month or two and you will be contacted regarding the results of the case. 2. Liability: A liability claim indicates that you, the driver of the Zipcar, are at least partially responsible for the accident. If our insurers pay the other party for their property damage or medical bills, you will be responsible for the damage fee based on the total cost of the accident. For more details on your liability coverage with Zipcar, please go here. If you are responsible for an accident but you believe there was little to no damage to the other party's vehicle, please contact us immediately. We will need pictures of the other party's vehicle, a police report, and/or a witness' statement to verify the damage. Remember, you are our eyes at the scene of an accident and we depend on you for evidence. These claims can take six months or longer to close, but we will let you know if anything is paid out to the other party. Our insurer will use the Incident Report that you submit to us as your final and complete statement of the incident; they will only contact you if they see a discrepancy or have questions regarding your statement. However, you are more than welcome to follow along with the claim and speak to your adjuster directly. Please email accidents@zipcar.com for the contact information for your claim. What happens if I don't agree with the insurance company's decision regarding fault? Members are expected to work with the insurance companies regarding the investigation of the claim. Once a claim has been closed, there is no appeal and the claim cannot be reopened. What if my credit card provides accident coverage? If the credit card that you use for Zipcar reservations provides coverage (or you think it might), please file a claim with your credit card immediately following the accident. The faster you do this, the more likely it is that your credit card company will pay for the damages and you won't have to pay anything! American Express: You can file your claim online via the following link: https://yourcarrentalclaim.com/ Or you can call 1.800.338.1670 and select option 1 to file a claim. MasterCard: Please call (800) 622-7747 and ask to file an auto claim. They'll transfer you to the correct area. MasterCard claims require that you sign a form and send it back to them. On this form, please be sure to check off "Irrevocable Assignment of Benefits;" this will allow MasterCard to work with Zipcar directly on the claim so you won't be charged. Discover: Call (800) 252-4670 to file a claim or go to Chubb.com for more information on your coverage. Diner's Club: Call (800) 613-5975 to file a claim. Visa: Please call 1-800-348-VISA (1-800-348-8472) and ask to file an auto claim. There are certain terms and conditions that apply, so please review www.visa.com/benefits for additional information or to file your claim online. Others: Please call the customer service number on your credit card statement, then ask to file an auto claim, they'll transfer you to the correct area. To file a claim, you will be asked your card number and expiration date, personal information (name, address, phone, email), as well as information about the accident and the Zipcar itself. The 'rental agreement' or 'contract number' is simply your Zipcard number. Please make sure to provide the address of our Home Office at 35 Thomson Place, Boston, MA 02210, (p) 617.995.4231.   One key question that they usually ask is "Did you decline the collision damage waiver (CDW)?" If you did not purchase the damage fee waiver from Zipcar, then you can answer YES to this question. If you did purchase the Zipcar damage fee waiver, your answer would be "NO, however, our damage fee covers the whole cost of the accident, not just collision damage." In other words, the Zipcar waiver is not solely for collision and you may still qualify for the coverage through your credit card by explaining this point. Please email the claim number to accidents@zipcar.com as soon as possible and keep us up-to-date with claim information. Often times, the credit card companies only communicate with their cardholders leaving us in the dark and you without your refund! Once the claim is filed, your credit card company will contact Zipcar for additional documentation and we will turn this around to them within 2-3 business days. Generally, if approved, this whole process takes less then a few short weeks and members don't end up having to pay anything toward the accident. Unfortunately, if your credit card company denies the claim, you will be responsible for the damage fee. If you have any questions, please email accidents@zipcar.com or call and ask to speak to someone on the Accident Team. expand all Zipcar membership and billing When will I be charged for my membership fee?
