The Science of Citrus UC Riverside has pursued research, educated future leaders and provided an economic engine to Inland Southern California for more than 50 years. But we never forget where we came from. The roots of the campus are the UC Citrus Experiment Station, which opened in 1907. Since then, UCR has played a role in the release of every orange, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit grown in California. We've bred more than 40 new citrus varieties and helped growers fight pests and diseases. In fact, nearly every orange, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit found in supermarkets can be genetically traced to UCR. Today, UCR's Citrus Variety Collection is one of the world's most diverse living collections of citrus and related types with approximately 900 different varieties. Check it out!
