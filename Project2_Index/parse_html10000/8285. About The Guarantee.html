To pursue this special degree rather than a traditional AA or AS degree, you should meet with a counselor to develop an education plan that puts you on the path toward the AA-T or AS-T degree. The guarantee itself means that students who earn an AA-T or AS-T degree and meet the CSU minimum eligibility requirements are guaranteed admission to a CSU, but not necessarily to a particular campus or major. With the special degree, you may be given a GPA bump when applying to an impacted campus outside your local area or an impacted major that is deemed similar. In addition, once at the CSU, if you are admitted and enrolled in a designated similar degree program you have the opportunity to complete your bachelor’s degree with as little as 60 semester units or 90 quarter units of coursework. A counselor will help you determine which CSUs offer bachelor’s degrees that correspond to your AA-T or AS-T degree. It is still important for you to apply to the schools that interest you and follow admissions deadlines to be considered. × Deemed Similar The CSU system has determined which bachelors degree majors correspond to the associate degrees for transfer available. See the Degrees pages for a list of campuses that offer majors that have been deemed similar to the Associate Degree for Transfer majors. × Your Local Area For students that earn an AA-T or AS-T degree, for CSU admission purposes “local area” is defined by the community college that confers the degree.
