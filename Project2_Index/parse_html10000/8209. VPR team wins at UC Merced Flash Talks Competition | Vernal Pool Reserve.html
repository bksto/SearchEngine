The members discussed topics ranging from what the reserve is and its significance to the importance of conserving the rare ecosystem and lastly, the future plans our team has to in an effort to further benefit the state of the reserve. The event was hosted by Robert Goodman, the STEM specialist at the Career Services department on campus. According to him, "The judges were extremely impressed with the event and impressed with [the teams'] current activities.  They specifically mentioned that they did not know that students were behind such monumental change in the San Joaquin Valley and fully supported your projects, activities, and initiatives." We are very proud and honored to have gained enough votes among the audience. Thank you to all that voted!
