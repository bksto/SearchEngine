While we serve as the primary advisors for about 1,000 students who are still deciding on a major, we also offer a variety of other services including: instructional opportunities to assist students in identifying interests, values, needs and abilities to set attainable academic and life goals, intrusive advising and guidance for students in academic distress and advisor training for faculty.  The center is conveniently located between the parking garage and the Reng Student Services wing of the Student Union on Caraway Road. ADVISE If you are still deciding on a major or just have a general advising question to ask, the Wilson Advising Center's academic advisors are eager to assist you. We are a walk-in center and appointments are welcome but not necessary. CONNECT Freshman students are enrolled in the First Year Experience Course-Making Connections.  This course is designed to help students make a successful transition into college by connecting students to campus resources, A-State policies, learning techniques, critical thinking skills, and degree information.  Wilson Advising Center Staff serve as instruction instructors for the general sections of Making Connections.
