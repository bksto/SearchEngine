I think I'm prepared to begin my fall semester. Moreover, spending one month earlier on the campus helped me know the campus more! Now I can help other freshman to look for their buildings!"  -Ellie Hsieh, Taiwan "I feel so lucky that I chose to attend the Transitions Program. I learned really important things about how to adjust to life in the university. I now better understand how American teachers educate students and the importance of cooperation among peers. Additionally, doing activities like the "scavenger hunt" and listening to lectures on American culture totally shocked me-- I learned so much! Through these activities I deeply fell in love with UIUC. All in all, freshman should choose this program without any hesitation!"  -Bofan Sun, China  "During the six-week Transitions Program, I learned a lot about our campus, American history, and American culture. We had excellent trips to Chicaco and to visit Abraham Lincoln's house in Springfield. The volunteering experience at the Food Pantry was unforgettable. The courses gave me knowledge like how to write a good essage, how to start small talk, and how to talk like a native speaker. I loved this program-- it helped me a lot!" -Zixuan Qian, China  Calendar News Videos Tuesday, March 5 Important deadlines and dates Resources Florida Avenue Residence Hall International Student Organizations on Campus Office of International Students and Scholars IEI's Youtube page Intensive English Institute  |  Dr. Maggie Courtright, Interim Director  |  iei-transitions@mx.ullinois.edu © 2012 University of Illinois Board of Trustees The Intensive English Institute is a member of the University Consortium of Intensive English Programs.
