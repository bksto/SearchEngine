Investment banker and UC Regent Richard C. Blum began the Blum Center at his alma mater, UC Berkeley, and it has expanded to the other UC campuses, all focused on different aspects of emerging economies. UC Merced’s center’s theme is “Global California: The World at Home, and at Home in the World.” The center will concentrate on three facets of the region’s economic challenges: Community-inspired innovation – examining ways to engage communities and the region in their own long-term success; Sustainable solutions – taking environmentally, economically, and socially sound approaches to growing prosperity; and Analytics of prosperity – using scientific measures to ensure that our activities actually improve quality of life Like all of UC Merced’s centers and institutes, the Blum Center will feature interdisciplinary research and projects, and will have affiliates from other UC campuses, as well. Research and education initiatives will be faculty-led, and many will involve the community.   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
