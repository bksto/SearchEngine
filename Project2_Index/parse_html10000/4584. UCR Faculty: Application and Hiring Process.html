The Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC) In order to ensure recruitment of the best available candidates, UCR is a founding member of the Higher Education Recruitment Consortium or HERC. HERC operates as a clearinghouse for academic and staff employment opportunities at colleges and universities throughout Southern California. The site also features a "dual-career" job search function that can help spouses and partners of faculty and staff find employment within the region. The Hiring Process Faculty and academic staff positions are filled by individual departments via an extensive and effective hiring process. In order to ensure it is able to hire the best and most diverse faculty members possible, the hiring process follows this format: Recruitment efforts that clearly state necessary qualifications, the rank - assistant, associate or full professor - being recruited and how to apply for the position. A search committee typically creates the pool of potential employees and develops a list of candidates who will be interviewed. Some units use the entire faculty to select the short list. Candidates are notified by the department chair if they are selected for appointment. Following a positive vote from the faculty and approval from the dean, the department will begin negotiations with the candidate. The chancellor's approval is needed before anything binding can be communicated to the potential employee. The review process for all appointments typically follows this track: Department College/school dean Committee on Academic Personnel, or CAP Ad Hoc Committee, if requested by CAP or other reviewers Vice-provost for Academic Personnel Executive vice-chancellor and provost Chancellor When the university is prepared to complete the hiring process, the Office of Academic Personnel will prepare an appointment letter for distribution to the prospective employee. Candidates accept the appointment by signing the appointment letter and returning it the Office of Academic Personnel, then following up by completing employment documents.
