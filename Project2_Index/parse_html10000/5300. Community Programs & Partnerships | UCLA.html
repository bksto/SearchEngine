You partner with leaders in environmental and social improvement. Through the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA connects, educates and encourages the upcoming generation of professional and scientific leaders to create a healthier planet, both on — and off — campus. UCLA also offers a variety of programs for students to pick and choose how they want to get involved in the community. Interested in health improvement? Join the Mobile Clinic and learn how to treat the whole patient. Want to help the local community? Become a member of BruinCorps and tutor children in low-income areas of Los Angeles. Or work as a counselor at UCLA UniCamp. Interested in becoming a doctor or dentist? Connect with UCLA/Salvation Army Outreach Clinic and help provide free dental and health screenings to the greater Los Angeles area. For community members seeking career guidance and support, UCLA's Center for Labor Research and Education connects the Southern California labor community with extensive resources and programs. Supported by a committee of 40 local labor and community leaders, the Center provides on-site advice and support to the university's local community, while offering off-site guidance in its Los Angeles outreach office. Both centers work to better promote research, education and policy change that improve the lives of workers, students and the community.
