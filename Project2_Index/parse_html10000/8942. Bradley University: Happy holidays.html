Home In the Spotlight Happy holidays Happy holidays Hayden-Clark Alumni Center, by Troy Rexilius '13. Additional images December 22, 2011 Adorning the mantelpieces of Bradley family far and wide this year are season’s greetings featuring watercolor renderings of the oldest and newest campus icons. Behind the brushstrokes are two of the University’s own artists, Lori Luthy B.S.’95, M.F.A. ’01 and Troy Rexilius ’13, an art education major. Luthy’s painting of Bradley Hall, the University’s first building, is featured on a card welcoming new students to Bradley. “I hope students will see this image of Bradley Hall and feel the warmth that really defines our campus and the students who bring it to life,” said Luthy. The students in the painting are representations of real Bradley students seen in University photographs. Showcased on Bradley President Joanne Glasser’s holiday greeting was Rexilius’ painting of the recently dedicated Hayden-Clark Alumni Center. “I have always felt very welcome at Bradley and that’s the feeling I tried to incorporate in the image,” said Rexilius, who appears in a photo with Glasser on the card’s back cover. “The calm and inviting colors I used helped me create a feeling of comfort and hominess.” For alumni interested in visiting their home away from home during the holiday season, the alumni center’s Shaheen Hall of Pride will be open at the following times: Dec. 22-23           8 a.m. – 5 p.m. Dec. 26-30           noon – 5 p.m. Jan. 2-13              8 a.m. – 5 p.m. The University Bookstore will be open at the following times: Dec. 23               8:30 a.m. – 5 p.m. Dec. 26-30          noon – 5 p.m. Jan. 2                  8:30 – 5 p.m. The alumni center and bookstore will both be closed Dec. 24, 25 and 31 and on Jan. 1.
