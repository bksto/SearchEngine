Another 100 graduate students attend accelerated, part-time, or full-time programs within our four advanced degree options. Focused on You Foster College of Business faculty and staff are dedicated to teaching and learning, taking a personal interest in the success and growth of our students. Our students learn from 54 full-time faculty – including three executives-in-residence – not from graduate assistants. Informed by their on-going research and consulting, our faculty readily share their knowledge and first-hand business experiences with students both in and out of the classroom. Have Confidence in Your Degree Ranked among the best, the Foster College of Business is one of only 3 percent of the world’s business schools to achieve and maintain the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International) accreditation for both our business and accounting programs. The Foster College of Business received an "A" grade in faculty quality and ranked overall in academic quality in the Bloomberg Businessweek ranking of the best U.S. undergraduate business programs for 2014. Bradley’s undergraduate entrepreneurial program has ranked among the top 25 in the nation for the past three years by The Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine. Over 85 percent of our students secure at least one internship, many with Fortune 500 companies. For the past five years, at least 95 percent of our graduates were either putting their degrees to work or attending graduate school within their prospective fields within six months of graduation. Foster College of Business graduates routinely gain full-time career positions with top employers—recent graduates have joined companies such as Accenture, Allstate, AT&T, Caterpillar, Chicago Board of Trade, ConAgra Foods, GE Capital, KPMG, Oracle and Target Corporation. Bradley University consistently ranks among the top Midwestern comprehensive universities (U.S.News & World Report: Guide to America's Best Colleges). U.S. News also ranks Bradley third among "Great Schools at Great Prices." Bradley University was included in the "Top Colleges for Top Students" in Peterson's Competitive Colleges, and ranked 24th Most Entrepreneurial in the nation by Forbes. Global Initiative The Foster College of Business keeps pace with the global direction of our economy and understands the importance of international knowledge and experience in preparing our future business leaders. Students can study abroad throughout Latin America, Eastern and Western Europe, and Asia. Our unique Global Scholar Program focuses on the ways in which culture influences business by offering specific coursework, language instruction, and two intensive international experiences centered on emerging business destinations within China, India or Mexico. Practical Experiences In addition to coursework that combines a theoretical and practical perspective, students gain real-world experience through special projects, field experiences and internships. Since 1972, every senior business student has undertaken the Senior Capstone, a team-oriented consulting project, gaining practical experience in solving a business challenge for a local business or not-for-profit organization. All students participate in an intensive weekend course in Team Dynamics taught by the staff of the Executive Development Center, a network associate of the Center for Creative Leadership, the preeminent leadership development organization in the world. Through projects sponsored by the FCBA’s Center for Business and Economic Research, and The Turner Center for Entrepreneurship, Foster College of Business students graduate with practical knowledge gained from several real-world experiences. Dedicated Faculty Our faculty’s first passion is helping our students learn. Courses are not taught by graduate assistants, but by professors who take a personal interest in their students. Foster College of Business faculty are a vibrant community of scholars attracted to Bradley from prestigious graduate schools throughout the nation. Energized by their research and continued work with the business community, our faculty share their knowledge and experience to provide a rich and relevant learning environment for our students. Service to the Business Community The Foster College provides the business community a variety of resources, including management talent, graduate and executive programs, and cutting-edge business information. Foster College's Business Centers also work closely with the business community, providing educational, research, and consulting expertise. Ongoing educational events such as the McCord Lecture Series offer the Foster College of Business students and the Peoria community opportunities to learn from internationally known speakers, scholars, and business leaders.  © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
