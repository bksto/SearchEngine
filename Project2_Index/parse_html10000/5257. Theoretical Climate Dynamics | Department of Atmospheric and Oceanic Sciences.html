We apply these methods to observations, numerical models, and experiments concerning the climate system -- the atmosphere, ocean, bio- and cryosphere -- through collaboration with researchers in North America and on other continents. Our group is led by Prof. Michael Ghil of the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (Center for Earth Systems Research) at UCLA.
