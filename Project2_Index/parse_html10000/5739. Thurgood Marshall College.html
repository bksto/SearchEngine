The legacy of Marshall College’s namesake lives on in its values that guide students to develop a disposition to give back, a disposition to equity and access for all, and a disposition to informed action throughout a lifetime of civic engagement – what we call the scholar citizen. We aim to develop graduates who understand their adult lives will take place in an American culture defined by complex histories and social struggles. That mission is lived most notably in our freshman year Dimensions of Culture sequence. This first-year sequence has inspired the Marshall College commitment to its Public Service Minor, Morehouse and Spelman College Student Exchange Program, Public Arts Initiatives, Artist in Residence Program, and its Partnership Schools Program in which students serve as tutors and mentors at selected public schools. General education at Marshall Marshall’s general education program will guide you to develop the tools necessary for a lifetime of learning – such as: Using the language of mathematics Experiencing human cultural expression in the arts and humanities Exploring the creation of knowledge in the sciences Advancing your written and oral communication skills These and other tools will serve as foundation for completion of your major.
