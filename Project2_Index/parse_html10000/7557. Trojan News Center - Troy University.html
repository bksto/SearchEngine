The Reverse Transfer agreement permits former Jefferson Davis Community College students who transfer to Troy University to transfer eligible credits back to JDCC for the purpose of attaining an associate degree. Students qualified for reverse transfer will have earned at least 15 semester credit hours from JDCC, will have earned at least three semester credit hours from Troy University, and will be in good standing at both institutions. Dr. Jack Hawkins, Jr., Chancellor of Troy University, said there has always been a strong link between the Alabama Community College System and TROY and that such agreements make good sense. "This opportunity to reward students for the work they do – even though they may do it in reverse order – is still good business," Dr. Hawkins said. "It makes sense and dollars for those graduates and speaks well of both the two-year system and the universities." Dr. William O. Blow, Interim President of Jefferson Davis Community College, said the agreement is good for students. "We teach a broad spectrum of students. This reverse transfer agreement we have with TROY is such an innovative thing," Dr. Blow said. "It's great student service and we are so happy to join Troy University in this effort." The agreement with JDCC is the latest is the latest of several such partnerships for TROY. Agreements have been previously entered with Chattahoochee Valley Community College, Southern Union State Community College, Lurleen B. Wallace Community College, Wallace Community College and Enterprise State Community College. Officials from Troy University and Jefferson Davis Community College signed a Reverse Transfer Agreement today at the JDCC campus in Brewton.
