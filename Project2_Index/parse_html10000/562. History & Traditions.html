About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > History & Traditions History & Traditions "With motives that are among the highest that can adorn the human heart…" In 1926, University students and alumni rallied together to save one of our most beloved symbols of pride—the "R" constructed by students high on a hillside of the nearby San Bernardino Mountains. The "R" watched proudly over our valley and our University below until the U.S. Forest Service threatened to remove it because of a ban on advertising. We urged officials to reconsider. It was a sign of loyalty, we said, pride, and history. Our motives, we argued, "are among the highest that can adorn the human heart." The "R" was saved to continue its watch over the University. Even in our infancy, the University was a place that valued history, and that has never changed in our 100 + years. From our legacy of service to the community to the revered Och Tamale chant, we celebrate a wide range of time-honored traditions with a commitment that grows deeper with every generation. We soar on the strength of our shared histories.   Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: Board of Trustees Office of the President History & Traditions History Our Founding Traditions Mascot Centennial Celebration 1907-2007 Schools & Locations Diversity at Redlands Green College Visiting the University Student Life Accreditation & Accolades What Others Are Saying City of Redlands & Region Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories There are more than 1,700 trees on the University of Redlands campus.
