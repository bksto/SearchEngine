Applicants may demonstrate their creative, artistic, and perceptual skills through painting, sculpture, or other three-dimensional explorations. Photography as an example of creative work must demonstrate intention in composition, color/light, or other critical points of view. Master of Architecture—Level II, Master of Science in Architecture, Master of Science in Industrial Design, and Master of Arts in Architectural Studies Applicants should submit examples of work demonstrating an ability to pursue study at an advanced level. The portfolio should be of high quality and provide evidence of well-developed graphic skills, a sense of design, and an understanding of space, form, and volume at different scales. The review committee assumes the portfolio represents the applicant’s best abilities in design.
