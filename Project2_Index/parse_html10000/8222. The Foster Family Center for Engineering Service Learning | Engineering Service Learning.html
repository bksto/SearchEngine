Mentors provide steady guidance and act as role models as students prepare for their futures, including finding ways to serve others with their talents and knowledge. Through the Center, students work with nonprofit community partner organizations on specific business challenges. The Center brings together students from all grade levels and disciplines, giving the students valuable experience in teamwork and in developing lasting and practical solutions individually tailored to their partners' needs. The Center’s Skill Sessions workshop series offers all students the opportunity to develop knowledge and experience in technical and professional skills relevant to their disciplines. Founded in 2004 with Engineering Service Learning courses as its core, the Foster Family Center for Engineering Service Learning began as UC Merced's inaugural and unique way to structure experiential learning.   Main menu Home Prospective Students Student Application Teams Team Structure Events Skill Sessions Community Partners Community Partner Request Form Sponsors PG&E ESL Lab The Foster Family Center for Engineering Service Learning Contact Us Sponsors PG&E ESL Lab The Foster Family Center for Engineering Service Learning Resources Site List Directory About UC Merced UC Merced The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
