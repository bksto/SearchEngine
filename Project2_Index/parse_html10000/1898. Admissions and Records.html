REQUIREMENTS: The student must have attended a high school (public or private) in California for three or more years. (Online High School’s must be recognized by the California department of Education). The student must have graduated from a California high school or attained the equivalency prior to the start of the term (for example, passing the GED or California High School Proficiency Exam). An alien student who is without lawful immigration status must file an affidavit with the college or university stating that he or she has filed an application to legalize his or her immigration status, or will file an application as soon as he or she is eligible to do so. Students who are nonimmigrants (for example, those who hold F (student) visas, B (visitor) visas, etc.) are not eligible for this exemption. The student must file an exemption request including a signed affidavit with the college that indicates the student has met all applicable conditions described above. Student information obtained in this process is strictly confidential unless disclosure is required by law. Students eligible for this exemption who are transferring to another California public college or university must submit a new request (and documentation if required) to each college under consideration. Nonresident students meeting the criteria will be exempted from the payment of nonresident tuition, but they will not be classified as California residents. They continue to be “nonresidents.” If you qualify for the AB540 Exemption you might be eligible for certain types of Financial Aid. Contact the Financial Aid office for more information.
