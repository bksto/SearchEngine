At UCLA, student artists and scholars and their professors are committed to making their communities better—one person, one street, one neighborhood at a time. Social and civic responsibility are in the very essence of our DNA at UCLA. Whether it's teaching the arts to K–12 students and teachers in L.A.'s underresourced schools and correctional facilities, producing films in partnership with benefactors like Bill and Melinda Gates, enlisting the arts to fight AIDS, or taking performances into regional theaters and community centers, we are there.
