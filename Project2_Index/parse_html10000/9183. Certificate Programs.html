programs. What is a Certificate? A certificate is a non-degree program designed to provide students with specialized knowledge that is less extensive than, and different from, a master's program. A certificate from UCR Extension demonstrates that you have completed a planned, sequential program of study in a particular field of knowledge and that course of study has met the standards of academic approval set by the Academic Senate at UC Riverside.
