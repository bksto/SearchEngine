Worcester Polytechnic Institute About WPI Academics Admissions Research Campus Life Athletics Skip to Additional Navigation Home  > Admissions > Undergraduate Admissions > Visit with Us > Personal Interviews Personal Interviews WPI offers personal interviews throughout the spring, summer and fall. While interviews are not required, they can be helpful both for the admissions office and the applicant. Interviews give us a chance to get to know you better, and they provide another opportunity for you to learn more about WPI. If you choose to interview with us, you should be prepared to talk about yourself; including your senior year academic schedule, your interest in WPI, and why you feel that you are a good match for our programs. A summary of your interview will become part of your admission file and may influence the admission decision we make. The interview will also provide an opportunity for you to ask questions and share additional personal information. Interviews last 20–30 minutes, and then we allow time for parents or families to ask questions. If you are unable to schedule an interview your chance for admission to WPI will not diminish. Students interested in interviewing will be granted only one interview, whether on campus or off campus. On Campus On campus interviews are conducted by an admissions counselor or an admissions intern. Interviews are offered on campus for rising seniors March 15–December 15 (Early Action Round 1 candidates who wish to interview must complete it by November 1). Appointments are limited; please call the Admissions Office at least two weeks in advance at 508-831-5286 to arrange an interview. We also recommend a campus tour and information session during your visit. Please note that interviews are strongly recommended for homeschooled and early admission (those students graduating early from high school) candidates. Off Campus If you are unable to travel to campus for an interview, we offer opportunities for students to interview off campus. Admissions counselors conduct interviews off campus in domestic and international locations each fall and in a limited number of locations in the spring. Interviews are held on specific nights determined by staff travel schedules. Details are posted each year in late summer. Due to limited time in each location, preference is given to seniors. Juniors will be accommodated on a space available basis.   Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Academic Programs WPI At-a-Glance Living at WPI Your Perspective Applying to WPI Visit with Us Meet the Team Information Sessions & Campus Tours Saturday Visits Open Houses Personal Interviews Office Hours and Parking BEANS Virtual Tour Online College Fairs Pre-College Opportunities Request Information Admissions Calendar + There are currently no events in the calendar.
