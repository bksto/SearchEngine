Admission information session The first portion of the Discover Stanford program is a one-hour information session conducted by a representative from the Office of Undergraduate Admission. The representative will discuss characteristics that make Stanford distinctive, as well as Stanford’s admission process and commitment to financial aid. (Please note that occasionally the Information Session will follow the Campus Walking Tour.) Further information about applying to Stanford is available at the Stanford Undergraduate Admission website.

Prospective Students: Planning a Spring Visit? We strongly encourage prospective students planning a visit to do so either before March 14 or after April 7 in order to maximize the value of the visit. These are our busiest weeks of the year, and they coincide with Stanford's final exams and our own Spring Break — large crowds are thus paired with limited offerings and greatly reduced tour guide staffing. To truly get a sense of what Stanford is like, come during an academic quarter in order to sit in on classes, enjoy smaller tour groups, and take part in special interest tours and programs. For more information, please contact us at (650) 723-2560 during business hours. View Schedule & Register Campus Tours & Programs The schedule shows availability for all tours. Some tours and programs require reservations. Make or modify reservations using links located on the calendar. Frequently Asked Questions What kind of weather should I expect at Stanford?
