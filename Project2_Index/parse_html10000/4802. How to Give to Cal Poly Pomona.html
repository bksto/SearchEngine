Planned Giving Planned gifts can be designed to meet your personal philanthropic and financial goals. Some planned gifts, such as bequests, require no current outlay of funds.

Matching Gifts When you give to Cal Poly Pomona, you can multiply the effects of your generosity by taking advantage of a corporate matching gift program. Contact the Human Resources or Employee Benefits Office at your company to find out whether they will match your gift. You may also qualify under the matching gift program of a company from which you retired, at which your spouse works (or retired), or whose board of trustees you serve. In-kind Gifts Gifts-in-kind are gifts of tangible personal property, such as equipment, materials, crops, and company products or inventory.
