Home Undergraduate Graduate Prospective Parents ​ Students and parents are often apprehensive about borrowing loans. While it is important to be cautious of irresponsible borrowing, loans are considered an integral part of a student's Financial Aid package. Please carefully review the different types of loans available below and consider each one as a viable option for financing a college education. Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide. We strongly encourage students to use the Financial Awareness Counseling available through the Department of Education’s student loans site available through the Department of Education. This tool can be a great help for students to manage their finances and student-related debt.   Federal Perkins Loan The Federal Perkins Loan is awarded to undergraduate students who are considered on-time FAFSA applicants and who demonstrate sufficient financial need. Interest Rate and Repayment The interest rate is 5%. The interest does not accrue until repayment begins. Repayment begins nine months after the student graduates, leaves school, or drops to less than half-time. When repaying your Federal Perkins Loan, you may want to consider loan consolidation. Loan consolidation is one of the most important financial decisions that you will make in your lifetime. The UCSB Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships recommends that you research your options carefully. Visit Direct Consolidation Loans for more information. Affiliated Computer Systems (ACS) is the Perkins loan billing agent for all UC campuses. You will be contacted by ACS concerning your Perkins loan; please carefully read messages that you receive from ACS, including both letters and e-mails. How to Apply To apply for a Federal Perkins Loan, you must: Apply for Financial Aid Accept your Perkins Loan through My Aid Status Complete a Perkins Loan Entrance Interview Complete a Perkins Loan Promissory Note. ACS will send you an e-mail with a link to the Promissory Note Exit Requirements When you leave UCSB, you must complete a Perkins Loan Exit Interview Federal Direct Student Loan UCSB participates in the Federal Direct Loan program. Funds for the Direct Loans are provided by the U.S. government directly to students. These loans have low interest rates and do not require credit checks or collateral. Direct loans also provide a variety of deferment options and extended repayment terms. All Direct Loans are either subsidized or unsubsidized. Under the subsidized loans, the government pays the interest while students are in school. To receive a subsidized Direct Loan, you must be able to demonstrate financial need. With unsubsidized loans, students pay all the interest, although they can have the interest payments deferred until after graduation by capitalizing the interest. This adds the interest payments to the loan balance, increasing the size and cost of the loan. Many students combine subsidized loans with unsubsidized loans to borrow the maximum amount permitted each year. View the Annual Federal Direct Loan Limits For more information, view your Direct Loan Borrower's Rights and Responsibilities (PDF). Interest Rate and Repayment View the "Direct Loan: Post-Graduation" presentation The interest rate for Federal Direct Student Loans depends on when the loan was first disbursed. Visit the Direct Loans website for more information. Repayment for these loans begins six months after a student leaves school or drops below half-time enrollment. When repaying your Federal Direct Student Loan, you may want to consider loan consolidation. Loan consolidation is one of the most important financial decisions that you will make in your lifetime. The UCSB Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships recommends that you research your options carefully. Visit Direct Consolidation Loans for more information. How to Apply To apply for either the subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan, you must: Apply for Financial Aid Accept your Federal Direct Loan through My Aid Status Complete a Direct Loan Entrance Interview Complete a Master Promissory Note Information about your loans will be submitted to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS).

Exit Requirements When you graduate from UCSB or fall below half-time enrollment, you must complete a Direct Loan Exit Interview. Parent PLUS Loan PLUS Loan Tutorial Provides information about the Parent PLUS Loan, from applying to disbursement UCSB participates in the Federal Direct Loan program. Funds for the Direct PLUS Parent Loans are provided by the U.S. government directly to parents. Direct loans provide a variety of deferment options and extended repayment terms. Interest Rate and Repayment For the current interest rate, and the current origination fee, please visit Studentaid.gov. Repayment begins 60 days after the final disbursement of the loan. For example, if a parent borrows a Parent PLUS Loan for their student's first year at college, and the student receives one-third of the loan amount for each quarter (Fall, Winter, Spring), repayment on the loan will begin 60 days after the final third of the loan amount disburses to the student in Spring quarter. Repayment would not begin after the student leaves school, even if the parent borrows a Parent PLUS Loan each year their student is in college. If a parent is unable to make loan payments, they may apply for a deferment or forbearance, including a deferment while their student is enrolled at least half-time in college. Visit the Direct Loans website for more information. How to Apply Parents apply for the Parent PLUS Loan at StudentLoans.gov. In order to log into the website, a parent will need their social security number, date of birth, federal student aid PIN, and their student's loan eligibility (see below). Our office receives daily electronic updates for completed loan applications. Please allow five business days for our office to process the loan. While applying for the loan, a parent will be asked for the amount they would like to borrow. Parents should ask students to provide them with the PLUS loan eligibility listed on their Financial Aid Award Letter, accessible through My Aid Status. Also, please be aware that the lender charges an origination fee, which is taken out of the proceeds of your loan. Parents should carefully consider the disbursement method for their PLUS loan. While applying for the loan, parents will be given two disbursement options (view the disbursement question): Student: The PLUS loan is disbursed to the student's billing account (BARC). Proceeds from the loan first pay any university fees currently charged to the BARC account and the remaining amount is then "refunded" to the student either through direct deposit or a check. This disbursement method is highly encouraged. Parent: The proceeds of the loan are mailed as a check to the parent borrower’s address during the second week of classes for that particular quarter. These checks are not mailed until after the fees on the student's BARC account are paid or deferred. In other words, the check from the PLUS loan will not be available in time to pay for university fees. Graduate PLUS Loan Federal legislation permits graduate students to borrow through the PLUS (Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students) Loan program. The Graduate PLUS Loan allows graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of education minus other Financial Aid received. Interest Rate and Repayment The interest rate is fixed at 6.41%. Interest begins accruing as soon as the first disbursement is made. Payments on the Graduate PLUS Loan are deferred while Graduate students are in school as long as they are enrolled at least half-time. When repaying your Graduate PLUS Loan, you may want to consider loan consolidation. Loan consolidation is one of the most important financial decisions that you will make in your lifetime. The UCSB Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships recommends that you research your options carefully. Visit Direct Consolidation Loans for more information. How to Apply You will apply for the Graduate PLUS Loan at StudentLoans.gov. In order to log into the website, you will need your social security number, date of birth, federal student aid PIN, and your loan eligibility (see below). Our office receives daily electronic updates for completed loan applications. Please allow five business days for our office to process the loan. While applying for the loan, you will be asked for the amount you would like to borrow. Your PLUS loan eligibility is listed on your Financial Aid Award Letter, accessible through My Aid Status. You will also be asked to provide the estimated Cost of Attendance for UCSB; this amount is also located on your Financial Aid Award Letter. Information about your loans will be submitted to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). Information in NSLDS is accessible to schools, lenders, and guarantors for specific purposes as authorized by the U.S. Department of Education. Alternative Loans Alternative loans (also known as private loans) can help to fill the gap between the cost of education and the amount of other Financial Aid offered. These loans are provided by private lenders for those students who need to borrow funds in excess of the yearly maximums for the federal loan programs. Most lenders will take applicants' credit history into consideration when evaluating applicants’ eligibility. Students and/or parents may be eligible for these alternative loans which have varying criteria (interest rates, minimum monthly repayments, etc.). They are not federally guaranteed student loans. Students have the right and the ability to select the alternative loan lender of their choice. We highly recommend that students exhaust their federal Direct Loan eligibility before pursuing funds through an alternative loan. Also, be aware that parents of dependent students are able to borrow up to the complete cost of education through the federal Direct PLUS Loan program. Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options including income-based repayment plans and loan forgiveness benefits, which other education loans are not required to provide.

They are simply provided for your convenience. Per HEOA guidelines, our office adheres to the UC Student Loan Code of Conduct.
