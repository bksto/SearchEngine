Admission Volunteers College Counselors Parents/Families The First-Year Experience Our Commitment Underlined by the notion that education does not begin and end in the classroom, Stanford's commitment to its undergraduates is inherently linked to every aspect of their life on "The Farm". The extraordinary resources here provide the support and tools necessary to explore and construct their future pursuits; most notable is the Freshman Dean's Office, an office which welcomes and integrates freshmen into the Stanford family from acceptance of admission through the end of the first undergraduate year. Your Opportunities The first-year experience at Stanford is supported by the celebration of the extraordinary talents of the diverse students, faculty and organizations that attract excellent speakers, performers and scholars from around the world. Whether it is listening to a prominent speaker, singing in their first a cappella concert, engaging in an academic colloquium, cheering on Stanford basketball as a member of the Sixth Man Club or applauding the opening of a new exhibit at the Cantor Arts Center, Stanford is abuzz with opportunities to explore new passions, engage with a vital community and simply put, have fun.
