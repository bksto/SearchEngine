The Hornets (5-9) were supposed to play both CSU Bakersfield and Loyola Marymount today, but rain washed that plan away and both games will not be made up. Sacramento State went 2-1 at the tournament, which included victories over Bakersfield and College of Charleston, as well as a loss to tournament host CSUN. Sacramento State returns to action next week when the team plays four times - twice on Friday and twice on Saturday - in San Luis Obispo at the Mustang Classic. The Hornets open with games against both Bryant and IUPUI on Friday. 2015 Season Online Media Guide Photo Galleries 2015 Quick Facts 2015 Capital Classic Live Stats Quick Links Archives Div.
