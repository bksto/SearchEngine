Distributed Learning (909) 537-7439 The concept of distributed learning implies a system through which the campus can more fully “distribute” its academic resources to its diverse and broad-based population, whether the issue is physical distance or merely time constraints. Distributed learning techniques engage students more actively (or interactively), and focus on helping students achieve class objectives via a number of state-of-the-art technologies, including compressed video, satellite, cable, Internet and on-line delivery formats.
