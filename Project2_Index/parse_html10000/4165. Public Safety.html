I can assure you that our number one goal on and around the campus is to provide for the highest level of safety, service, and protection of our students, administration, staff, faculty, and guests. As a 24-hour, 7-day per week, year-round provider of service, we are committed to ensuring the safest environment where your educational goals, social engagements, and recreational activities can be attained in the safest manner possible. The Public Safety team is comprised of the director, associate director, two sergeants, and 12 patrol officers. Collectively there are more than 400 years of prior law enforcement experience amongst the Public Safety personnel. We also have a support staff which includes a Public Safety Specialist, Dispatchers, Shuttle Drivers, Locksmiths, and Student Workers. Each and every one of these professionals is committed to your safety. Working Together for a Safe Campus Community The University of Redlands, Department of Public Safety works collaboratively with each and every stakeholder in the internal and surrounding communities of the campus and you are an integral part of that relationship. We strive to create and maintain a positive atmosphere that enables and encourages learning in a safe, efficient, and responsible environment. In addition to these efforts, it is imperative that everyone maintains a proactive and responsible approach towards their personal safety. The University enjoys a long standing strong and cooperative relationship with the City of Redlands as well as the Redlands Police and Fire Departments. This partnership has proven itself to be mutually beneficial throughout the years. The University employs a proactive approach to safety which includes four interactive components: Education; Prevention; Intervention; and Enforcement. Each of these components requires the cooperative commitment from everyone who attends, visits, or works within the University community. I invite you to browse this site to acquaint yourself with the Department of Public Safety and the services we provide. I hope you will find this website both helpful and informative. I welcome any questions, comments, or suggestions you may offer that may assist us in our continued efforts in providing the most effective and efficient public safety services to the University of Redlands community.   Jeff Talbott Director of Public Safety See Also Megan's Law Offender Information Redlands Police Web Site Emergency Web Site Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: Public Safety UR Bulldog Alert TIP411 Current Security Messages Annual Security and Fire Safety Report Shuttle & Taxi Services Student Protests Campus Safety Reporting Campus Lighted Pathways Map Contact Public Safety Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories Contact Redlands University of Redlands Department of Public Safety 1200 E.
