Fall 2014 grades are now finalized. Fall 2014 Degree/Diplomas Processing will begin on Monday, January 12, 2015. This process takes 8-10 weeks to clear the students eligible for graduation. Once the degree has posted, it will immediately appear on both official and unofficial transcripts while the diploma is processed. Students will be notified by email as we begin to print diplomas in early February. Diplomas are printed and mailed approximately three weeks after the degree is cleared/posted, beginning in February and continuing through late March. Make sure that your “home” mailing address is up-to-date. Transcripts Transcripts can be ordered at any time. Transcript requests are routinely processed and mailed out 5 to 7 business days after arriving in our office. CSUSM does not offer expedited (RUSH) handling of requests. Transcripts are processed on a first-come, first-served basis. Please note that due to high volume of requests received at the beginning and end of each semester, transcript processing time varies and can take up to 10 business days. Time-sensitive orders should be requested early to ensure that the recipient receives your transcript(s) prior to any application deadlines or opportunities.
