All Other Units: Report IT security incidents to the unit security coordinator designated by your school, college, or department or to your IT department. If you do not know who that is, report the incident to security@umich.edu. If you are unsure where to report an incident, you can report it to either the ITS Service Center or security@umich.edu, and ITS staff will sort out the reporting and tracking. The most important thing is to report the incident. Important: If the incident poses any immediate danger, call 911 to contact law enforcement authorities immediately.
