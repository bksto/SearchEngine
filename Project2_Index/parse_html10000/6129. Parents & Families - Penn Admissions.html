Congratulations and best wishes for your student's success, Eric J. Furda C'87 Dean of Admissions Dear Parents & Families of Prospective Students, I am pleased to welcome you and thank you and your child for including Penn in your college search.  It is with a great sense of purpose that we approach our goal of identifying those students most likely to thrive in and contribute to the Penn community.  Benjamin Franklin founded this university, the nation’s first, on the principle that all the best minds should have access to the finest education, regardless of ability to pay.  Some 270+ years later, Franklin’s principle, and his vision of Penn as a university committed to service to society, remain our focus.  We are proud that Penn meets a family’s demonstrated financial need without the use of loans, empowering students to graduate debt free. At the core of Penn’s Ivy League education is a rich exploration of the liberal arts and sciences alongside pre-professional studies.  Penn provides students with the intellectual flexibility, practical skills, and real experiences needed to thrive in an increasingly complex world.  The Penn community is remarkably dynamic-and the resources of our Philadelphia hometown are wide-ranging. We sincerely appreciate your interest and the trust you place in Penn Admissions by including us in your family's journey.We hope you'll find this information helpful as you and your child discover Penn. Best wishes for your student's success, Eric J. Furda C'87 Dean of Admissions College Search Tips and College Search Resources included on the menu (at right) may help your family navigate the college search process.
