They are already spending quality time and extensive resources working with a number of schools to make significant improvements. I have no doubts about Blackboard's commitment to Accessibility. —Ed Garay, Assistant Director for Academic Computing, University of Illinois at Chicago Blackboard is fully committed to ensuring that our platform contains no barriers for users with disabilities and is both usable and accessible by everyone, regardless of age, ability, or situation. Our commitment can be evidenced by the following third party evaluations of the Blackboard Learn platform: Conformance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Priority AA, issued December 2012 by Deque Systems Blackboard Learn is the first and only LMS in the world to deliver a conformance statement by a third-party, demonstrating our focus and determination to deliver excellence for everyone. Gold level certification for non-visual access, issued by The National Federation of the Blind (NFB) Blackboard was the first LMS in the world to achieve this certification. With valuable input from our clients and a strong set of development and testing tools, we invest in accessible products and capabilities that meet the wide range of our client’s needs. To fulfill this promise we are continually partnering with industry experts to audit our code and user interface design techniques to ensure the accessibility of the products. Blackboard measures and evaluates accessibility using two sets of standards: the WCAG 2.0 standards issued by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act issued in the United States federal government.
