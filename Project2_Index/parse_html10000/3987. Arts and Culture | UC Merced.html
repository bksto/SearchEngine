Arts UC Merced Presents is a performance series open to UC Merced students, faculty and staff members, and the surrounding community. The program features quality professional artists and a range of offerings that fulfill its mission to not only entertain, but to educate and enrich. The program also coordinates the annual Bobcat Art Show each spring, showcasing art created by UC Merced students, faculty and staff members in the areas of drawing, painting, sculpture, mixed media and photography/digital art. Additionally, the UC Merced Art Gallery has become a vibrant place for aesthetic, cultural and intellectual exchanges on campus. Founded by Professor ShiPu Wang in 2011, the gallery has presented a variety of exhibits and events that connect with diverse members of the UC Merced and Merced communities. The gallery's student curators, enrolled in Wang's museum-and-curatorial-studies courses to acquire historical and theoretical knowledge and hands-on skills, have helped make the gallery a success. UC Merced has also partnered with many community art organizations including: Merced ArtHop Merced County Arts Council Merced Symphony Merced Theatre Playhouse Merced ShakespeareFest   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
