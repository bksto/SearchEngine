Financial Awareness Counseling The Department of Education has released a new tool to help you understand your financial aid and to assist in managing your finances and debt. Financial Awareness Counseling Financial Literacy Learning to effectively manage your finances is an important skill to learn while you are in college. In the current economic climate, financial literacy on college campuses is a growing concern. More and more parents and students are turning to loans to fund the increasing cost of a college education. The financial decisions that students make now will impact them for years to come. CashCourse.org is brought to you by the National Endowment for Financial Education, an independent, nonprofit foundation committed to educating Americans on a broad range of financial topics and empowering them to make positive and sound decisions to reach their financial goals. Visit CashCourse.org Budget Planning Tools Our office encourages students to budget their money wisely in order to avoid over borrowing or the use of high interest loans and credit cards. In an effort to help students track their Financial Aid, income and expenses we have developed two budget calculators. These budget calculators are Microsoft Excel files, optimized for use on Microsoft Windows. Simple Budget Planner » A simple personal finance budget planner that allows you to quickly sum the costs associated with each quarter at UCSB. Monthly Budget Planner » A detailed planner for comparing monthly income and expenses, including projected and actual amounts.
