The Hornets opened the day by defeating San Diego, 4-2, and came back later to beat IUPUI, 2-1. San Diego dropped to 10-10 with the loss and IUPUI fell to 12-4. The Hornets conclude tournament play with a pair of games tomorrow against Bryant (9 a.m.) and host Cal Poly (2 p.m.). The Hornets (7-9 overall) have now won three straight and four of their last five games, and have held the opposition to two runs or less in three of those five contests. All six runs scored by the Hornets today came with two outs. GAME 1 The Hornets pounded out four runs and seven hits, and Matthias tossed her third complete game of the season, allowing two runs while scattering nine hits over seven innings. The Toreros stranded at least one runner on base each of the first six innings until Matthias set down the side in order in the seventh. San Diego hit .077 (1-for-13) with runners on base, and stranded runners in scoring position in the first, second, fourth, fifth and sixth innings. Meanwhile, Sacramento State scored all four runs with two outs, and hit .364 with runners on base and .400 with runners in scoring position. The Hornets scored a pair of runs in the first inning and led the rest of the way, adding a run in both the third and fourth innings. San Diego closed the deficit to 2-1 in the top of the second, and 4-2 in the top of the sixth. The Hornets scored both runs in the first with two outs, as a Paige Castro RBI-double scoring Shelby Johnston and an RBI-single from Alexa Chattleton scoring Kortney Solis accounted for the runs. Sacramento State had three hits in the inning, including a one-out infield single from Zamari Hinton. After the Toreros cut the lead to 2-1, the Hornets pushed across another run in third when Castro's two-out, RBI-double scored Solis. That lead was extended to 4-1 in the fourth on a two-out, RBI-double from Martin which scored Makenzie Wayadande. Sasha Margulies opened the inning with a leadoff single, and Wayadande entered as a pinch runner before eventually coming around to score. Five different Hornets had hits, including multiple-hit games from both Castro and Chattleton, who each went 2-for-3. Castro had a pair of RBIs and Chattleton drove in one run. With the win, Matthias improved her record to 3-4, and needed 102 pitches to finish off the complete-game effort. San Diego's Paige Von Sprecken (7-4) got the loss, allowing seven hits and four runs over six innings. GAME 2 Brooks carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning before allowing a solo home run to Megan Cory that led off the sixth. That was the only blemish as the right-hander finished the game allowing just two hits and one walk while striking out nine batters. Brooks (3-1) faced just four batters over the minimum, and struck out Maggie Good with the potential tying run on second base to end the game. After walking the first batter of the contest, Brooks retired 15 batters in a row while striking out the side in both the first and fifth innings. In fact, at one point, Brooks struck out five straight batters spanning the first and second innings. The reigning Big Sky Conference Pitcher of the Year needed 102 pitches to earn her third victory of the season. Sacramento State got all the runs it needed in the second inning. After Margulies led off the frame with a double, a Marissa Maligad two-out double drove Margulies home, and Maligad later crossed home plate on a double from Martin. The Hornets had other chances to score in the game, stranding 12 runners on base, including two in every inning but the fifth and sixth. The Hornets finished with nine hits, led by Martin, who went 3-for-4 with two doubles with an RBI. Castro posted her second straight multi-hit game, going 2-for-4. Besides Martin and Castro...Hinton, Chattleton and Margulies all hit safely in both games today. IUPUI's Brooke Boetjer (10-4) took the loss, allowing two runs and four hits in two innings. Emili Escamilla pitched the final five innings of shutout ball. 2015 Season Online Media Guide Photo Galleries 2015 Quick Facts 2015 Capital Classic Live Stats Quick Links Archives Div.
