Through Dinner with 12 Titans (D12), Cal State Fullerton alumni open their homes to students for small dinner parties or host the students at local restaurants, bringing these "strangers" together in a warm, friendly environment for good food, conversation, and camaraderie. The concept of dinner with 12 strangers may sound intimidating and unusual, but the program aims to build and strengthen the Titan community. Apart from good food and conversation, the program offers students the opportunity to network with Cal State Fullerton alumni, find out about life after college, and interact with professors and staff outside the classroom. It also provides a chance for students to get a feel for the extended Titan family and to see how they can stay involved with and connected to Cal State Fullerton after they graduate.   Student Guest Alumni Host D12 Host Attend   This site is maintained by the Alumni Relations.
