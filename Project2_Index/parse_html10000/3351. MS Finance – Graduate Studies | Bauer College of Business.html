This has generated a demand for a focused, intensive course of study in the technical aspects of security valuation, trading strategies, hedging, and corporate reorganization. This demand has given rise to the Master of Science in Finance Program at the C. T. Bauer College of Business. The program provides students with a focused, technical concentration in the finance area to help graduates deal with the increasingly complex world of finance.
