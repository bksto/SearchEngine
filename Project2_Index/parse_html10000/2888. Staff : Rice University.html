We think they're onto something — and so do our faculty and staff, who enjoy Rice's competitive pay and benefits, including countless opportunities for personal and professional growth. Add to that a vibrant sense of community; the beautiful, tree-rich, 300-acre campus; highly skilled and talented colleagues who are passionate about their work; and Rice's strong commitment to bettering the world through first-class education, environmental sensitivity and path-breaking research, and you might start to think that Houston's premier business journal is onto something, too. Rice launches new travel and expense system Rice employees and students who travel or report expenses will soon have a new tool at their disposal: Concur, a Web-based integrated travel and expense system, which will go live Oct. 20.
