(AP) -- The student government at University of California, Irvine has voted to ban display of the American flag -- or any flag -- from its lobby. A resolution that was narrowly approved by the legislative council of the campus' Associated Students calls bans all flags from the common lobby area of student government offices, according to the Orange County Register (http://bit.ly/1EV1kJD ). It prompted removal of the American flag from a lobby wall. The student council approved the resolution on a 6-4 vote Thursday, with two abstentions. The executive cabinet was expected to consider a veto on Saturday. The resolution authored by student Matthew Guevara of the university's social ecology school lists 25 reasons for the ban, saying that the American flag has been flown in times of "colonialism and imperialism" and could symbolize American "exceptionalism and superiority." The resolution says "freedom of speech, in a space that aims to be as inclusive as possible, can be interpreted as hate speech." The American flag had hung on a wall in the student government suite. A few weeks ago, someone removed the flag and put it on the desk of Reza Zomorrodian, the Associated Students' president, with an anonymous note saying it shouldn't be in the lobby. The executive members decided to put up the flag again. Then the resolution was brought to the council. Advertisement Zomorrodian, an opponent of the ban, said the American flag was "an iconic and symbolic representation of our values in the U.S." On Friday, state Sen. Janet Nguyen, R-Santa Ana, said she and other legislators may introduce a state constitutional amendment to prohibit "state-funded universities and college campuses from banning the United States flag." ------ Information from: The Orange County Register, http://www.ocregister.com File: An American flag attached to a light pole flies in downtown Orinda, Calif., on Wednesday, July 2, 2014.
