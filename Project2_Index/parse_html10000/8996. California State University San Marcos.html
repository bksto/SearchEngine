Student Research Your browser does not support inline frames or is currently configured not to display inline frames Cal State San Marcos recognized student research as an integral part of student learning. CSUSM is continually exploring new ways to provide opportunities to students and faculty to expand research opportunities and to provide resources for presenting, distributing, and disseminating student research. The STEM Center The STEM Center is a central component of a new CSUSM initiative to increase the quantity and quality of students receiving degrees in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields. The center supports College of Science and Mathematics students by providing study space, access to peer tutors, study skills workshops, and information about academic and career opportunities. Senior Experience The Senior Experience Program matches teams of students with projects submitted by local businesses and organizations. Students gain by working as consultants on rigorous, real-world projects that require teamwork and application of classroom knowledge. Businesses gain by receiving concentrated attention from bright, energetic teams that provide a fresh, independent look at their projects. Community Service Learning The Corporation for National and Community Service defines community service learning as "a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities."
