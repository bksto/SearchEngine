These interactions are fostered by the numerous Materials-related research centers at UCSB. The Materials Department prides itself on sustaining a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment. Most of the faculty have joint appointments with other departments in the College of Engineering, including Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering, or the College of Letters and Science including Chemistry, Physics, and the intercollege Biomolecular Science and Engineering Program. The collaborative research environment is fostered through several major centers: Center for Multifunctional Materials and Structures Dow Materials Institute International Center for Materials Research Materials Research Laboratory Mitsubishi Chemical Center for Advanced Materials Solid State Lighting & Energy Electronics Center The California Nanosystems Institute The Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies The Institute for Energy Efficiency UCSB Center for Stem Cell Biology and Engineering Home | College of Engineering | UCSB
