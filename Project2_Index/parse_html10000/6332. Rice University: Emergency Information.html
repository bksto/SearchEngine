Contact information should include local and home emergency numbers where Rice can most effectively provide time-sensitive emergency information. Rice will limit use of this emergency contact information to only the most urgent campus emergencies. Rice urges community members to take seriously any emergency notifications received via their primary emergency contact point and to respond accordingly. The University periodically tests its emergency communications systems to continually assess its ability to communicate quickly and efficiently. Policy Statement “The purpose of emergency planning is to ensure proper effort by all areas of the University and to protect life and property of the Rice community, to keep lines of communication open to all areas of the community, and to define responsibilities of essential personnel in the event of a man-made or natural emergency.”  --Rice University Research Policy No. 105-02 Rice University follows three guiding principles for emergency planning, response and recovery: Life Safety Preservation of Research and Key Assets Resumption of Teaching and Research © Copyright PIER Systems, Inc.
