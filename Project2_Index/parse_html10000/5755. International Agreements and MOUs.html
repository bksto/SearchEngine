International agreements represent an outstanding opportunity for UCR faculty, staff, and students to grow and learn through contact with international colleagues. A partnership may be codified through an agreement known as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), or an International Exchange and Linkage Agreement (IE Agreement). The MOU is a broad agreement in which UCR and a partner express an intention to engage in cooperative academic or research activities. The IE agreement involves a commitment of UCR resources for specific cooperative international academic and research activities.
