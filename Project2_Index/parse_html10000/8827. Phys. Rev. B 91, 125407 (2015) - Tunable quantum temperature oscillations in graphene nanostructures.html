Using a realistic model of a scanning thermal microscope, we predict quantum temperature oscillations whose wavelength is related to that of Friedel oscillations. Experimentally this wavelength can be tuned over several orders of magnitude by gating or doping, bringing quantum temperature oscillations within reach of the spatial resolution of existing measurement techniques.

The probe is allowed to come into thermal and electrical equilibrium with the sample and measure the temperature Tp.Reuse & Permissions Figure 2 The calculated spatial temperature profile for a zigzag GNR probed by a Pt SThM fixed 2.5 Å above the sheet shown for two energies and for weak and strong environmental coupling with κp0=10−4κ0 and κp0=700κ0, respectively. In all panels phonons are included with κph=0.01κ0. By adjusting |μ−μDirac| the temperature oscillation wavelength can be tuned. Even with strong environmental coupling and significant phonon heat conductance, the quantum temperature oscillations are visible. The phonon temperature Tph is taken to vary linearly between each electrode, and the applied temperature gradient across the nanoribbon is 50 K.Reuse & Permissions Figure 3 The power spectral density (PSD) of a slice through the edge row of the GNR shown in Fig. 2 as a function of gate potential. The temperature oscillation wavelength increases as μ−μDirac is decreased, in reasonable agreement with Eq. (4), whose values are indicated by vertical blue lines. The PSD spectra are complex because of the small size of the GNR, the multimode nature of the Pt SThM, and the phonon conductance. The temperature data within 10 Å of each electrode have been neglected in the PSD spectra and κp0=10−4κ0.Reuse & Permissions Figure 4 The simulated temperature profile of a graphene fragment without (left panel) and with (right panel) impurities contacted by a hot (T1=350K) needle electrode (the benzene-like contact pattern is indicated with red circles) and a “cold” electrode (T2=T0=300K) bonded to the periphery of the sheet (blue circles) probed by a Pt SThM tip scanned 2.5 Å above the plane of the carbon nuclei. In these simulations, we use κp0=700κ0 (extracted from experiment) and κph=0.01κ0. The hot needle and periphery electrodes have per orbital coupling strengths of 1 eV and 0.1 eV, respectively. In the right panel, 0.33% boron (black circles), 0.33% nitrogen (white circles), and 0.33% vacancy impurities were included. Here μ−μDirac=−1eV.Reuse & Permissions× More Links APS Earlier Issues News & Announcements About this Journal Journal Staff About the Journals Join APS Authors General Information Submit a Manuscript Publication Rights Open Access Policies & Practices Tips for Authors Professional Conduct Referees General Information Submit a Report Update Your Information Policies & Practices Referee FAQ Advice to Referees Outstanding Referees Librarians General Information Subscriptions Online License Agreement Usage Statistics Your Account Students Physics PhysicsCentral Student Membership APS Members Subscriptions Article Packs Membership FAQ APS News Meetings & Events Privacy Policies Contact Information Feedback ISSN 1550-235X (online), 1098-0121 (print). ©2015 American Physical Society.
