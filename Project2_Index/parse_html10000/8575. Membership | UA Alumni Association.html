Margaret Havas '10 "When I was a kid, I had no hesitation about where I wanted to go for my university education. Though I graduated in 2010, I am a Wildcat bleeding red and blue. It's only fitting that I continue this tradition and that's why I'm a Wildcat for Life member." ________   Contact Membership Team Provide Feedback Join/renew today!
