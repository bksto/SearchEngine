About Ask Submit Archive Email Instagram YouTube New book by Dr. Seuss coming this summer Over 2 decades since his death, a new book by Dr. Seuss will be released this July. The book comes from a discovery in 2013 of a collection of manuscripts and sketches. Much of Dr. Seuss’s work resides at UC San Diego in their Special Collections Library. The work is accessible to scholars and on display so that members of the general public can also enjoy his work.

She also made a key discovery about nuclear fission. In the 1950s, women were often faced with stark choices: “At that time, women teachers in the U.S. at all levels were expected to resign if they married, so I proclaimed boldly that I would never teach,” she said. “I vowed to follow Marie Curie’s model, to marry if I wanted and have children if I chose.” In the 1950s when she sought a research position in the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the radiochemistry goup, she was told, “We don’t hire women in that division.” Undeterred, Dr. Hoffman got the position and became a division leader of the isotope and nuclear chemistry division, the first woman to head a scientific division there.  For Hoffman, nuclear chemistry is a uniquely fundamental form of research, one that probes the deepest nature of what we call matter. But she adds, “There is also an array of practical issues that require the expertise of nuclear chemists—new and safer nuclear reactor designs, better medical diagnostics and radio-pharmaceuticals, more sensitive techniques for detecting proliferation, safer nuclear waste storage and environmental remediation, to name but a few. The field is wide open—there are many great discoveries yet to be made.” #chemistry #science #uc berkeley #nuclear #elements #radiochemistry #darleane hoffman #berkeley lab #lbnl #los alamos #llnl 222 notes, 2 days ago Three-legged dog to get 3-D-printed limb from UC Davis students Hobbes the terrier mix can do a lot, for a dog with three legs. He can climb stairs, graze the backyard and jump roughly 4 feet in the air – more than high enough to clamber onto the bed with his owner, Andrea Bledsoe. Fortunately for Hobbes, his owner’s friends Randy Carney and Holly Abney have a knack for materials science and animal anatomy, respectively. The two put their heads together to find a way to help their furry friend and started on what’s turned out to be a challenging extracurricular project. They’ve cast him in a plaster mold, fitted him for harnesses and tried a few materials in an effort to come up with a design for a prosthetic limb, which they plan to produce with a 3-D printer. “Some of the coolest stuff you’ll see with 3-D printing is in the medical field,” Ware said. “Creating solutions tailored for individual people is a very powerful thing.” #dog #uc davis #ucd #3-d printing #animals #science #three-legged dog 142 notes, 3 days ago What’s The Best Way To Teach Math To Struggling First-Graders?  The old-fashioned way. Math teachers will often try to get creative with their lesson plans if their students are struggling to grasp concepts. But in “Which Instructional Practices Most Help First-Grade Students With and Without Mathematics Difficulties?" the researchers found that plain, old-fashioned practice and drills — directed by the teacher — were far more effective than "creative" methods such as music, math toys and student-directed learning. The researchers from the University of California, Irvine and Penn State examined more than 13,000 first-grade math students in 1,300 schools nationally. They found that first-graders who scored in the bottom 15 percent on math tests were more often subject to activities that have no evidence of fostering retention or improving performance. For example, teachers with lots of struggling students often sought to liven up their lessons by adding movement or music. But the researchers found little evidence that those methods worked. Instead, they found that the only activity associated with gains in performance on an adaptive, untimed, one-one-one administered test is what we think of as traditional instruction. Namely, a teacher demonstrating how to solve a problem, followed by repeated opportunities for students to work by themselves, replicating the procedure with worksheets and drills. These results run contrary to some interpretations of the Common Core, where students collaborate, talk through a problem and dissect the different ways to reach a solution. The researchers found that while this kind of learning can work for some students, those already struggling in math failed to grasp concepts as easily as they did under more traditional lessons.  Read 5 Lessons Education Research Taught Us In 2014 #math #education #research #uc irvine #uci 161 notes, 3 days ago GM workers don’t have to pay for the machines they use.

Construction will start on a test track this year. A group of engineers along with 25 students at UCLA’s School of Architecture will work on a wide array of issues, including route planning, capsule design, and cost analysis. Craig Hodgetts, a professor at UCLA, while co-lead the team. He says the biggest issue for the Hyperloop is actually being able to weave it into existing urban environments.  Listen to him discuss the project #science #hyperloop #gif #ucla #transportation 118 notes, 4 days ago This is a photo of HIV (red) taking over a human T-cell Today marks the 30th anniversary of the first HIV test in the U.S. — a major turning point in eradicating the epidemic. #HIV #health #aids #science #ucsf #t cell 153 notes, 5 days ago How Do Our Bodies Fight Off Dangerous Chemicals? UC San Diego’s Amro Hamdoun explains how you can think of cells like night clubs. With every substance that a cell encounters it has to decide which to eliminate and which to let in. Since humans have generated over 80,000 synthetic compounds, it’s now ever more important to understand both what these substances are doing to our bodies, but to also create a rule book for making these chemicals safer. #science #uc san diego #ucsd #health #environment 101 notes, 5 days ago Happy Birthday Dr. Seuss!   The top image is from UCSD’s Dr Seuss Collection at Geisel library, the largest collection of original Dr. Seuss works.

In this case, UC San Diego structural engineering Ph.D. candidates set out to Florence, Italy at the invitation of the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo to conduct a structural “health assessment” of the Baptistery of St. John. The structure was completed in 1128 and was the site where the Italian poet Dante and many other notable Renaissance figures were baptized. Using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) laser scanning, ultra-high-resolution photography and thermal imaging techniques, Mike Hess and Mike Yeager of the Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art, Architecture and Archaeology (CISA3), constructed a comprehensive 3-D model of the interior, exterior and facade of the 5,500 square foot Baptistery. Yeager explains: This is a building constructed hundreds of years ago for which there are few original plans or drawings. One of our goals was to create a record, which is an exact representation of the Baptistery as it stands today and will serve as a critical reference, tomorrow, next year or a hundred years from now.

The cell is adapted to deal with compounds in the environment. You can think of cells as nightclubs. The line of people waiting to get into the club can be thought of as substances in the cell’s environment. So a cell really needs to constantly be considering what is allowed in such as nutrients for growth or what it needs to eliminate such as toxins. The mechanism of the cell that does this is called a drug transporter and these can be thought of as the bouncers outside of the club in this analogy. These are key because their ability to recognize that a certain compound is dangerous determines whether or not a compound will accumulate or be eliminated from the body.

The pupil, of course, is the central aperture through which light passes to strike the retina. It appears dark because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by tissues inside the eye directly or absorbed after diffusely bouncing around inside the eye, with very little of the light escaping the same way it came in. The pupil is a marvel, but it’s really just a hole. The work of adjusting the size of that hole – and thus the amount of light allowed inside the eye – falls to the iris. If the pupil is the aperture, the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop. The iris consists of two layers: the front pigmented fibrovascular (a combination of fibrous and vascular tissues), known as the stroma, and a two-cell-thick layer of underlying pigmented epithelial cells. In fact, pigment granules are found in dark colored eyes; blue eyes and those of albinos lack pigment. Two types of muscle occupy the stroma: a sphincter that contracts the pupil in a circular motion to reduce incoming light and a set of dilator muscles that pull the pupil open, like a ring of grabbing hands, to allow in more light.   #eye #eyes #ucsd #uc san diego #pupil 4915 notes, 1 week ago Can an awe-inspiring view boost the body’s immune response?  Awe is the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your understanding of the world. Early in human history, awe was reserved for feelings toward divine beings – e.g., gods. In 1757, a revolution in our understanding of awe began thanks to Irish philosopher Edmund Burke. In A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, Burke detailed how we feel the sublime (awe) not just during religious ritual or in communion with God, but in everyday perceptual experiences: in hearing thunder, in being moved by music, in seeing repetitive patterns of light and dark. Awe was to be found in daily life. So what does awe do for you in the present moment?  Awe may be important for good health. The focus for UC Berkeley psychologist Dacher Keltner is on one branch of the immune system known as the cytokine system. Cytokines are chemical messengers that are often produced by cells in damaged tissue. Many cytokines elicit an inflammatory response, which is important for killing pathogens and healing wounds.  Psychology is discovering that a hyperactive cytokine response renders the individual chronically sick and vulnerable to disease, a process that may be involved in how poverty shortens lives. Jennifer Stellar from Keltner’s lab recently documented that of all the positive emotions humans experience, only awe predicted reduced levels of cytokines. Though this is still quite speculative, it raises the possibility that some of the pernicious effects of poverty are due to awe deprivation. “That awe, wonder and beauty promote healthier levels of cytokines suggests that the things we do to experience these emotions – a walk in nature, losing oneself in music, beholding art – has a direct influence upon health and life expectancy,” said Keltner.  Why Do We Feel Awe? → #awe #sublime #psychology #science #nature #cytokine #uc berkeley #dacher keltner 192 notes, 1 week ago Older → © 2012–2015 | Powered by Tumblr Chrono Theme by UltraLinx
