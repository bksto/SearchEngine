Everything Stanford Has to Offer Our students draw on resources from all of Stanford University’s world-class schools, including law, engineering, medicine, education, earth sciences, and humanities and sciences. This collaborative, cross-disciplinary culture is evident in all Stanford GSB programs. You might even decide to pursue a joint or dual degree — which one in six MBA students chooses to do. An Unparalleled Faculty A team that includes Nobel laureates and members of the National Academy of Sciences, combined with a 6-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio, means every student has direct access to the incomparable level of expertise of our faculty. A Personalized Experience The intimate learning environment at Stanford GSB allows for close peer-to-peer interaction, small-group collaboration, and one-to-one coaching. In fact, our MBA class size is half that of other leading schools — averaging about 400 students. Our MSx, PhD, and Executive Education programs average low class sizes as well — about 100, 90, and 40 students per class, respectively. And, a wide array of course choices allows you to tailor your curriculum to your unique skills, experience, and goals. Your Stanford GSB experience will connect you with an exceptional range of experiences, individuals, and opportunities.

The project started after our research showed that entrepreneurial students needed space. We launched in a small basement, but now it’s a beautiful place of inspiration where there's movement and life; everyone's pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams. Alumni Spotlight Justin Finnegan Managing Director, Mountain Hazelnuts Venture Ltd. MBA2009 I chose Stanford GSB to learn business skills in an environment where I would be surrounded by interesting people with whom I could relate and learn. Surrounded by amazing faculty and classmates who never let me settle for mediocrity, I learned not to shy away from ambitious and life-changing goals.
