The UCI school code is 001314. The FAFSA constitutes the basic financial aid application and is required if you wish to be considered for all federal, state or university financial aid and scholarships. To be considered on-time, the FAFSA must be submitted by the March 2nd deadline (or the next business day if March 2nd falls on a weekend). In addition, you may be required to submit other supporting documents. The supporting documents vary according to your particular situation. These must be submitted by the deadlines specified. Please make sure the student's name and UCI Student ID # are clearly printed on the top of all documents you submit to our office. Be sure that all copies and entries are legible. If DHS immigration documentation is required, be sure to photocopy both sides of the document. CALIFORNIA DREAM APPLICATION: Students who are not eligible to file a FAFSA and qualify for the AB540 fee exemption can apply for certain types of financial aid by completing the California Dream Application.

Previous Video Next Video Show/Hide All What's My Aid Eligibility? (How Much Can I Get?) Cost of Education minus Expected Family Contribution = Aid Eligibility Your aid eligibility is determined by what it costs to attend UCI and what your family is expected to contribute towards those costs. The expected family contribution is determined using the information you provided on the FAFSA. That information is put into a standardized federal formula to determine your family's ability to pay your educational costs. If you are a dependent student both your and your parent's information will be used to determine your expected family contribution. If you are an independent student only your information will be used. Your aid eligibility is the difference between what it costs to attend UCI and what your family is expected to contribute. For example, a student living on campus with costs of $31,576 and a family contribution of $5,000 would be eligible for $26,576 in financial aid. How Will My "Aid Eligibility" Be Met? Once your aid eligibility is determined our office will put together a financial aid award that usually includes a combination of the following funds. Some funds require you be eligible (have financial need), others don't. Of course, if you don't complete your financial aid file on time you may not receive all of these types of awards. Grants - Must have financial need. Do not have to be repaid. Student Loans - Must be repaid with interest, usually after graduating or withdrawing from college. Scholarships - Awarded based on grades and other achievements. Work-Study - Earned through part-time employment.You will be notified of your eligibility. Every qualified student is eligible for some type of assistance, either need-based aid or unsubsidized/parent loans. In addition to the parent and student contributions described above, we consider other resources such as grants and scholarships from outside agencies, veterans' benefits, tuition waivers, and/or tuition remission plan fee waivers. To determine your "aid eligibility", we deduct your family's expected contribution and the amount of these resources from the cost of attending UCI. The remainder (if any) is the aid eligibility our office will attempt to meet. If I Don't Qualify for Need-Based Aid, Do I Have to Complete My Financial Aid File? Yes. You will be notified of any documentation we will require for processing any type of financial aid, including an Unsubsidized William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan or the Federal Direct PLUS Loan, which are not based on financial need. Don't wait for us to ask for documents, refer to "My Aid Application Status", and/or your SAR for required documentation we may need. Am I Eligible? In order to receive financial aid you must: be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, be registered with Selective Service (if required), attend a participating school, be working toward a degree or certificate, be making satisfactory academic progress, not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan, and have financial need (except for Unsubsidized Direct and Federal PLUS Loans) Deadlines Don't miss out on thousands of dollars in grants, lower interest loans or work-study! Meet all deadlines and get a Certificate of Mailing from the U.S. Postal Service when mailing any documents to our office. Don't wait until the deadline to provide the requested information! By submitting documents well in advance of the deadlines, you allow time for any corrections or unforeseen problems which might otherwise delay the receipt of your financial aid.

Priority Deadline: March 2 * *(or the next business day if March 2nd falls on a weekend) You should complete your FAFSA online at www.fafsa.gov. To assist in completing the FAFSA online you may wish to use the FASFA on the Web Worksheet. If you are unable to complete the FAFSA on the Web you may call 800-4FED-AID and request a paper application be sent to you or you may download a copy. Read the detailed instructions included with the application prior to completing the form. We strongly recommend you use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool while completing FAFSA On The Web. Doing so will speed up the processing of your financial aid. You and/or your parent(s) may use this option approximately two weeks after filing tax return(s) electronically and six to eight weeks after mailing a paper tax return to the IRS. Information from this form will be forwarded to UCI electronically from the central processor. Therefore, it is critical that our Federal school code 001314 and/or University of California, Irvine, be indicated on your FAFSA. PROOF OF SUBMISSION If you mail the FAFSA, you should get a Certificate of Mailing from the U.S. Postal Service. If you file your FAFSA online a confirmation page will display once the FAFSA has been successfully submitted. You should keep a printed copy of the confirmation page in your records. If you do not sign your FAFSA using a Personal Identification Number (PIN) you and one of your parents (if you are dependent) will need to sign the signature page and mail it to the address indicated.

You must return these documents by the date indicated on the My Aid website to maintain your eligibility for priority funds. CITIZENSHIP DOCUMENTATION The U.S. Department of Education will match student alien registration numbers with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data for verification of eligibility for federal financial aid programs. If there is no match, we will need to obtain confirmation of your immigration status. The U.S. Department of Education will also match citizenship status with Social Security Administration data. If there is no match, we will need to confirm your citizenship status. If you need to confirm your citizenship or immigration status we will ask you to submit a copy of one of the following documents to our office. Before we will be able to disburse your financial aid you must bring the original documents to our office for us to photocopy. DO NOT MAIL YOUR ORIGINAL DOCUMENT TO OUR OFFICE.
