Please be advised that this information may be available to the university community and others in the following publications: Student Directory The Student Directory is printed by the Office of Student Publications every Fall Term. It is published and distributed free of charge to University students by the Office of Student Publications at 420 Maynard Street. If you do not wish to have your information published in the Student Directory, you must notify the Office of Student Publications during the first two weeks of Fall Term.  You may download a Student Directory Delete Form at http://www.pub.umich.edu/publications/student-directory.  These forms are also available at a Registrar's Office Student Services Site during the first two weeks of Fall Term. U-M Online Directory The U-M Online Directory is provided by Information Technology Central Services (ITCS) and is accessible at http://directory.umich.edu. It is an online database of faculty, staff, students, alumni and groups. Each member of the U-M community has an entry in the directory. Information in the U-M Online Directory is updated monthly from the Office of the Registrar (for student entries) and Human Resources and Affirmative Action (for faculty and staff entries). You may use this directory to locate the telephone numbers and electronic mail addresses of members of the University community. The directory is protected so that it cannot be used to produce mass mailing lists, but the information is otherwise publicly available to anyone with web access. In addition to the information obtained from the Registrar's database, you can add other information about yourself to the directory. For instance, your electronic mail address, fax phone number, a second campus address or phone number, or a short description. Having information about yourself in the directory makes it easier for individuals on campus and around the world to communicate with you. Using this directory, your colleagues and friends can find your electronic mail address or telephone number. Furthermore, if you enter your local electronic mail address in the directory, you can use a simple, easy to remember electronic mail address in the form of youruniqname@umich.edu for your entire time at U-M, and have your electronic mail forwarded to wherever you are currently receiving mail. If you do NOT want to be listed in the U-M Online Directory, you have two choices: Update your directory information online. Information about changing your entry is available in the online document, The U-M Online Directory via the WEB: Finding and Changing Your Personal Entry (S4276). Fill out a Non-Disclosure of Information Request at a Registrar's Office Student Services Site. This will prevent the information from being published in the directory. Please be advised that updates from the Office of the Registrar to the directory occur monthly in batch. For more details regarding the U-M Online Directory, please call the ITCS consultants at (734) 764-HELP.  Copyright © 1995 - 2015 Regents of the University of Michigan; all rights reserved.
