Exemption from Immunizations: A student may request a religious or philosophical exemption from the immunization requirement prior to June 30 for freshmen and July 31 for graduate and undergraduate transfer students.  Attitudes, beliefs, or preferences that are purely personal are not grounds for an exemption.  Download instruction sheet and form. FAQs What is the difference between “required” vs. “recommended” vaccinations? Required vaccinations are enforced for school entry; Stanford requires that all students have 2 (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccinations AFTER their first birthday. Recommended vaccinations are important for your health. They are not required for entry to Stanford. The reason for requiring immunizations is: 1) to ensure that all students have proper immunity to avoid the spread of disease/illness throughout the campus community, and 2) to ensure that students are protected in case of any outbreak on campus. Do I need to have a physical exam prior to coming to Stanford University? While it is a good idea to finish any ongoing treatments before you leave for school, Stanford does not require you to have a physical exam. What if I cannot meet the Health Requirement deadlines? If you do not complete health forms on time, a hold will be placed on your future enrollment. If Vaden Heath Center does not remove the hold, you may incur additional registration fees, lose pre-selected classes, and loan and/or stipend checks may be interrupted. It is important that you complete the health requirements by the applicable deadline: Incoming Freshmen - June 30. New graduate students, medical students and undergraduate transfer students - July 31. I can’t find my immunization records; or my doctor has retired. Do I need to have the required vaccination(s)? If you cannot locate your immunization records, you have two options: You can be re-immunized, or See your doctor re: having a blood test to determine immunity to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella. Please note that if your blood test indicates you are NOT immune, or negative or equivocal you will need to be re-immunized by the deadline. My vaccination records are written in a language other than English, will Vaden accept them? No, immunization records must be translated into English before they will be accepted. What if I complete the online forms but don’t submit the Immunization Form signed by a physician/medical provider? The Immunization form is required and must be submitted. What if I have additional immunizations after I have submitted the Immunization form? Send or fax a copy of an updated record to Vaden Health Center, with a statement explaining that this is an update. What is a Hold? A hold prevents you from being able to register for classes; you may incur additional registration fees; you may lose pre-selected classes; your loan and stipend checks may be interrupted I am on hold. What do I do now? Contact Vaden Health Center or notify vaden-emr@stanford.edu, to get instructions on what you will need to do. Only Vaden Health Center can remove your hold. Because this involves your protected health information, we will NOT discuss this with third parties such as your school administration, professors, parents or anyone else without our explicit consent. If I become compliant will the hold be removed automatically? The process is NOT automatic, holds are manually removed. It typically takes about 24 hours for a hold to be removed once you have become compliant. Important:  Please note that holds can only be removed 8:00 am-5:00pm, Monday-Friday. I am a previous Stanford University student returning to start a new academic program (e.g., undergraduate to graduate). I fulfilled these requirements already. Do I have to complete them again? Previous Stanford University students returning to start a new academic program should make sure they are up- to-date with current Heath requirements. Do I have to complete the 'Tuberculosis Testing Form’ if I answered 'NO' to all questions on the Tuberculosis Screening Form? If you have candidly answered 'NO' to all of the tuberculosis screening questions you do not have to complete the 'Tuberculosis Testing Form'. What if I've had the BCG vaccine? History of BCG immunization DOES NOT fulfill this requirement, and it DOES NOT preclude you from needing to get a TB test.  People who have had a previous BCG vaccine may receive a TB skin test. In some people BCG may cause a positive skin test when they are not infected with TB. If a TB skin test is positive, additional tests are needed. The QFT blood tests, unlike the TB skin test, are not affected by prior BCG vaccinations and are not expected to give a false positive result in people who have received BCG. We recommend getting a QFT (QuantifERON-Tuberculosis Gold or T-spot blood test only accepted). We accept QFT results from any country. What happens if my Tuberculosis skin or Tuberculosis blood test result is positive? Submit the TB skin or TB blood test results. A chest x-ray is required. Please note: We only accept x-rays performed in the U.S. or Canada and the chest x-ray must be done within the 6 months prior to your Stanford University start date. If you have been treated for latent or active Tb, submit documentation of medication dose, duration of therapy, and completion date. Are students born in Taiwan or Hong Kong required to complete the Tuberculosis (TB) Testing and Clearance Form? Yes, TB testing is required.
