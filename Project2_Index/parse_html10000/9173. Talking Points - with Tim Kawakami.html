Talking Points with Tim Kawakami Search for: Menu Close Home About The TK Show 0 Warriors dominate the Clippers and Draymond Green gives just about the perfect response to a post-game bump Posted on March 8, 2015 by Tim Kawakami * Note: Spoke to a team source who reiterated that the Warriors’ interest in free-agent center JaVale McGee has always been tepid at best and now is practically non-existent, even after his near-deal with Boston fell through. Let’s emphasize: The Warriors already have three talented big men who are fighting for scraps of playing time–David Lee, Marreese Speights and Festus Ezeli. OAKLAND–Just a little bump–and more than a little symbolism–at the end of the Warriors’ dominating victory over the Clippers today. The Clippers were without Blake Griffin and Jamal Crawford, it must be noted. But the Warriors are just a better team than the Clippers, full strength or not, and they displayed that again today, much to the frustration of the Clippers, up to and including Draymond Green’s post-game interview on ABC, when LAC bench player Dahntay Jones looked like he purposely bumped Green on live television. Well, Green clearly believes that it was intentional, and the video seems to confirm that. Green’s team won the game–and he had 23 points on 8 for 15 shooting as the Clippers D blitzing Stephen Curry at every opportunity, giving Green and his teammates plenty of space and opportunity to make shots. Which they did.

So thank you, Apple.” Kerr had a lot of interesting explanations for things–more than I’ve transcribed here–but my wi-fi is getting a little shaky right now, so I’ll post this with the essentials right now and avoid future riskiness… * Kerr on David Lee’s place in the rotation after getting a DNP-CD on Friday: “I communicate with all my players all the time. And every player’s different, every situation is different. This is a really tricky one–David’s a great player. He’s been an All-Star. He’s still in his prime.

As usual: Not really, not really, and probably not Posted on March 7, 2015 by Tim Kawakami * Straight from today’s Merc website (MY VERSION)/ You think Raiders owner Mark Davis is a little eager for the start of the NFL free agent signing period on Tuesday? Yep, the Raiders have spent some difficult years while lining up the means, motive and opportunity to dive right in. And now… Continue Reading → 49ers, College football, Columns, NFL, Raiders 5 Carmen Policy on “The TK Show”: Discussing the Walsh-DeBartolo dynamic, Jim Harbaugh, and the current state of the 49ers Posted on March 6, 2015 by Tim Kawakami Sometimes when I hear Carmen Policy describe the moods, ups, downs, disturbances, glories, and dynamics of the huge personalities who ran the 49ers during the dynasty, it feels like he’s bringing you right into the room with him, Eddie DeBartolo, Jr., and Bill Walsh. Because Policy was there, he’s a great communicator, he’s ridiculously smart, and… he was so often the essential conduit between Eddie D. and Walsh. Listen to my 33-minute conversation with Policy today and you get as good a sense as you can get of what those days were like and how important Policy was. Frankly, this easily could’ve gone for an hour, 90 minutes, whatever, and it wasn’t just about the old times but also how the current 49ers hierarchy–Jed York, Trent Baalke and Co. are running things.

It’s a good, lively talk–covering all the ground I could on the Raiders’ stadium efforts in Carson and Oakland, the approach to the free-agent period coming within days, and some other things. Here’s the link to the full 25-minute conversation, including a second recommendation (after Jerry West’s two weeks ago) for Dan Tana’s in Hollywood. (We’re taping another episode with another major figure later today and we’ll post that in the afternoon.)

OAKLAND–I’ll make this quick, in the wake of the Warriors’ 102-93 victory over the Bucks at Oracle Arena tonight… The Warriors went small (again), which cued a rally back from a second-half deficit (again), and the defensive ferocity and offensive flow was highlighted by Draymond Green (again, again, again), Andre Iguodala and–most interestingly of all–Shaun Livingston. Coach Steve Kerr once again played only seven guys in the second half, subbing only Livingston and Iguodala and going with Green at center for most of the final quarter-and-a-half. The result: Livingston played 27 minutes total, including a big span in the fourth quarter as the point guard with Stephen Curry as the shooting guard, and that helped set Curry up for a typical Curry 3-3-3 surge that pumped the Warriors up to a 10-point lead.
