Freshmen – you will have the chance to meet with an academic counselor in your school (or the Division of Undergraduate Education if you are Undecided/Undeclared or a Pharmaceutical Sciences major) during orientation (SPOP). Transfer students – you will be contacted over the summer by the counseling office of your school about new student advising. Once the academic year begins, Academic Counselors and school Peer Academic Advisors will be your best resources to help navigate the maze of requirements and classes. UCI General Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue is the guidebook to academic requirements while you are at UCI. Sometimes requirements for classes and/or graduation change. The General Catalogue is your contract with the university. DegreeWorks DegreeWorks makes academic planning more convenient and effective. It is an instrumental tool for choosing coursework to stay on track to graduate by helping you see which requirements you have completed and have yet to fulfill for your major or for GEs. DegreeWorks also has a feature called "What If" where students can add a major or minor to see what additional requirements are needed. To access DegreeWorks, log in to StudentAccess. Registration Registration requires two actions: class enrollment and fee payment. Class Enrollment Enrolling in classes can be a bit tricky the first time, but you'll soon get the hang of it using WebReg to enroll in classes and make schedule changes. As an incoming freshman, you will register for classes during orientation. New transfer students will be informed of their enrollment registration time when attending academic advising. The time is usually within 24 hours of advising. While you are using WebReg, it may be helpful to open WebSoc, the UCI Schedule of Classes, in a separate window to see all your options at once. If you need to make adjustments after you have registered, you can do so on WebReg between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. In future quarters, enrollment windows begin opening on Monday of week 8 of the preceding quarter. Check StudentAccess for your window’s exact date and time. Fee Payment View your ZOT Account Online for your amount due. Pay your fees by the fee payment deadline. Missing the deadline results in a $50 late payment charge and all your classes are dropped. Academic Assistance A wide range of programs offering academic assistance for students is provided through the Division of Undergraduate Education’s Learning and Academic Resource Center (LARC) and Student Support Services (SSS) offices. Exams Final examinations are required for all undergraduate courses except for a few labs and studio courses. A finals schedule is published on the Registrar’s website and on the online Schedule of Classes. If you miss a final, see information about “Incomplete” grades and “NRs” in the Academic Regulations and Procedures section in the UC Irvine General Catalogue. Grades Your quarterly grades are available online on StudentAccess the Friday night 2 weeks after instruction ends. A complimentary student transcript is available from the Registrar’s Office the following working day. Transcripts You may order an official transcript of your academic record through the University Registrar; the fee, paid to the Cashier’s Office, is $13 per copy. Any outstanding debts you have to the university must be paid to the Cashier’s Office in full before your transcript can be released. Academic Probation As an undergraduate, you will be subject to academic probation if, at the end of any quarter, your GPA for the quarter or your cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. If your GPA falls below 1.5 for any quarter, or if you fail to raise your cumulative GPA to 2.0 after being on probation for two consecutive quarters, you will be subject to disqualification. You may also be placed on academic probation if you are not making satisfactory progress towards your degree as defined by the school of your major. Contact your Academic Counseling Office if you are having academic difficulties. Withdrawal from the University If you decide to leave UC Irvine during the quarter and have paid fees, you must complete an official Withdrawal Form available from the Registrar's Office. Readmission If you withdraw from UC Irvine or miss one or more quarters, you will need to contact the dean of your major for readmission. Principles of Community UCI is a multicultural community of people from diverse backgrounds. Our activities, programs, classes, workshops, lectures, and everyday interactions are enriched by our acceptance of one another, and we strive to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. Our legacy for an increasingly multicultural academic community and for a learning climate free from expressions of bigotry is drawn from the United States and California Constitutions, and from the charter of the University of California which protects diversity and reaffirms our commitment to the protection of lawful free speech. Affirmation of that freedom is an effective way of ensuring that acts of bigotry and abusive behavior will not go unchallenged within the University. Tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of background, gender, ethnicity, race, and religion are as crucial within our campus community as are tolerance, civility, and mutual respect for diversity of political beliefs, sexual orientation, and physical abilities. Education and clear, rational, and vigorous challenges are positive responses to prejudice and acts of bigotry. The University's nondiscrimination policy, in compliance with applicable federal and state law, covers treatment in University programs and activities as well as admission and employment. UCI expects all those affiliated with it to adhere to the letter and the spirit of University nondiscrimination policies and related federal and state laws. Information concerning these policies is available on the World Wide Web. Allegations of physical abuse, threats of violence, or conduct that threatens the health or safety of any person on University property or in connection with official University functions will be investigated promptly and, where found to exist, appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with University policy. All who work, live, study, and teach at UCI are here by choice and, as part of that choice, should be committed to these Principles of Community which are an integral part of the guidelines by which the University community can successfully conduct its affairs.
