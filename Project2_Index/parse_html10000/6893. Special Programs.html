The Law School offers Joint JD/Masters degree programs with Harvard's Business School, School of Public Health, Kennedy School of Government, and Graduate School of Design, as well as a coordinated JD/PhD degree with the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a joint JD/LLM degree with the Cambridge University Faculty of Law in England. In addition, students can arrange to complete the JD program concurrently with graduate degree programs other than those with which the Law School has established joint programs. Cross-registration into courses offered by other Harvard schools is a good way to explore subjects not offered by the Law School without enrolling in another degree program. Finally, the Law School permits students to study abroad for one semester.
