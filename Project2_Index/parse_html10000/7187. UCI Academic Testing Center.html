      The UCI Academic Testing Center, a unit within the Division of Undergraduate Education, administers the Placement Testing Program to new and continuing students to ensure correct placement in selected introductory courses and to help students assess their readiness for University-level work. These tests are selected or developed by UCI faculty who also determine the grading criteria for each test. Students, with the help of academic counselors, use results from placement tests to determine enrollment in introductory courses and to formulate a plan of study that is best suited for their learning needs and career goals. Placement tests are currently given in the areas of Physics, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Academic English. The Academic Testing Center also administers the Language Testing Program which provides proficiency tests as a way for students to seek satisfaction of language components of some UCI general education requirements, such as the Language Other Than English (Category VI) general education requirement and a portion of the International/Global Studies (Category VIII) general education requirement. Tests are offered in over 40 languages and are administered 3 times during the academic year. The Academic Testing Center participates with the Composition Program in the campus-based administration of the University of California Analytical Writing Placement Exam.                                                                   UCI Academic Testing Center 3040 Anteater Instruction and Research Building Irvine, CA 92697-4425 Phone: (949) 824-6207 Fax: (949) 824-3832 e-mail: testcenter@uci.edu Hours: M-F 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM   Orientation Transfer Students Office of Admissions Freshman Summer Start Program Web Mail Class Schedule Student Access Book Store Housing Study Abroad Center UCI General Catalogue
