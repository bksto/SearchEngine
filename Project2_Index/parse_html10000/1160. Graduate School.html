Learning Never Ends It is always the right time to think about expanding your horizons, improving your mind, extending your education.  The Graduate School staff are proud to be able to assist you in achieving your goals of an academic career, a new profession, or another life path of your choosing. Graduate School Campus Tour For Graduate Students wanting to visit the A-State campus, please contact us at gradsch@astate.edu to schedule a date, at least a week in advance.  Our campus tours are on Friday afternoons, from 1 to 4.  Our Student-led Walking Tour of our campus is approximately 30 to 40 minutes in length, weather permitting.  The tour includes our Student Union, Red WOLF Fitness facility, Academic Buildings, and the Dean B. Ellis Library Building. After your tour, you may want to visit our Arkansas State Museum located inside the Library Building, or try one of the food court options in the Student Union. Visits with program directors are not a part of the Graduate School Campus Tour and will need to be scheduled separately with that department directly, if desired.  You are strongly encouraged to bring unofficial transcripts to those department visits, if scheduled, for a more knowledgeable visit with them. Tuition Fellowships With a cumulative undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher, residents of any U.S. state or territory qualify for a fellowship reducing tuition to the in-state rate of an Arkansas resident. Students must be enrolled in at least 6 hours for Fall and Spring semesters, and at least 3 hours in Summer terms to qualify. International students pay a reduced tuition rate that is twice the in-state amount plus a fixed international student fee.
