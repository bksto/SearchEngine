Crafton Hills College (CHC) is investigating the processes involved in gaining authorization from other states. Depending on the outcome of this investigation, CHC could notify students residing in a particular state that they are not eligible to register for distance education courses. In cases where CHC students are affected by this change, Crafton Hills College will provide assistance to students to resolve this matter. The ultimate rationale for out-of-state authorization is the protection of students enrolling in out-of-state institutions who become victims of "predatory practices" regarding tuition, student loans, and financial aid. Although Crafton Hills College is not guilty of such practices, the college is required to provide current and prospective students with contact information for filing complaints. For complaints regarding grades, follow the Crafton Hills College "Student Grievance Procedure" and "Student Grade Appeals" policies found in the Crafton Hills College catalog. If an issue cannot be resolved internally, you may file a complaint with your state. WCET provides links to the phone numbers, e-mail, and/or links to state educational agencies. Crafton Hills College is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) under the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The ACCJC site provides complaint procedures against the accrediting commission or its accredited institutions. For questions concerning the complaint process or the new U.S. DOE regulations affecting distance education, please contact the Office of Instruction.
