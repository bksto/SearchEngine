It is violation of University policy and may result in serious disciplinary action. Sexual harassment consists of nonconsensual sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature on or off campus, when: a) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a condition of an individual's employment or academic standing, or b) submission or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions or for academic evaluation, grades or advancement, or c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance creating an intimidating or hostile academic or work environment. California State University, Fullerton's sexual harassment policy is the foundation for your understanding of and protection from sexual harassment. Complaints can be made to Human Resources, University Police, Athletics, WoMen's Center or Academic Affairs. Sexual Misconduct California State University, Fullerton is committed to maintaining and strengthening an educational, working, and living environment founded on civility and mutual respect. Sexual misconduct is antithetical to the standards and ideals of our community and will not be tolerated. CSUF aims to eradicate sexual misconduct through education, training, clear policies, and serious consequences for violations of these policies. Sexual misconduct incorporates a range of behaviors including rape, sexual assault (which includes any kind of nonconsensual sexual contact), sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, stalking, and any other conduct of a sexual nature that is nonconsensual, or has the purpose or effect of threatening, intimidating, or coercing a person or persons. When there is a lack of mutual consent about sexual activity, or there is ambiguity about whether consent has been given, a student can be charged with, and found guilty of, committing a sexual assault or another form of sexual misconduct. Much sexual misconduct includes nonconsensual sexual contact, but this is not a necessary component. Threatening speech that is sufficiently serious to constitute sexual harassment, for example, constitutes sexual misconduct. Photographs, video, or other visual or auditory records of sexual activity made without explicit consent constitute sexual misconduct, even if the activity documented was consensual. Similarly, sharing such recordings without explicit consent is a form of sexual misconduct. For example, forwarding a harassing electronic communication may constitute an offense. Many forms of sexual misconduct are also prohibited by California and federal law, including Title IX of the education amendments of 1972, and could result in criminal prosecution or civil liability. Sexual Violence Sexual violence is an array of nonconsensual sexualized behaviors ranging from uncomfortable touch to penetration. No form of sexual violence will be tolerated at CSUF. RAINN ;is a sexual violence resource hosting a 24 hour crisis hotline and robust informational pages. Types of sexual assault are defined here: http://www.rainn.org/get-information/types-of- sexual-assault. TheWoMen's Center is a resource on campus to report an assault or get referral information. All sexual harassment, which includes sexual violence, is a violation of student and employee civil rights. A Title IX report can be made by visiting Human Resources, WoMen's Center, Athletics, or University Police. Title IX Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance. Examples of the types of discrimination that are covered under Title IX include sexual harassment (including sexual violence), the failure to provide equal opportunity in athletics, and discrimination based on pregnancy. To enforce Title IX, the U.S. Department of Education maintains an Office for Civil Rights, with headquarters in Washington, DC and 12 offices across the United States. California State University, Fullerton is dedicated to ensuring Title IX rights. To file a complaint or learn more about Title IX visit Human Resources. Documents and Records Accessing Employee Personnel Files Accessing Employee Personnel Files CSU Records Retention & Disposition Schedules CSU Records Retention & Disposition Schedules Confidentiality of Employee Data Confidentiality of Employee Data Conflict of Interest According to Conflict of Interest Provisions, public officials may not make, participate in making, or in any way use or attempt to use their official positions to influence a governmental decision in which they know or have reason to know they have a disqualifying conflict of interest. University employees shall not vote, make recommendations, or in any way participate in personnel or financial decisions if such participation constitutes a conflict of interest. Annual disclosure statements are required upon appointment to designated positions and are updated annually. For additional information, please see the CSU Policies website on Conflict of Interest.

Affirmative Action Plan (Under Construction) Under Development Annual Campus Security Report Annual Campus Security Report Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act Collective Bargaining Agreements Collective Bargaining Agreements Collective Bargaining Agreements Updates/Changes Conflict of Interest Conflict of Interest Handbook Revised Gift Regulation Annual Filing Notification Consent for Sexual Activity Sexual activity requires consent, which is defined as clear, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement between the participants to engage in specific sexual activity. Consent cannot be inferred from the absence of a "no"; a clear "yes," verbal or otherwise, is necessary. Although consent does not need to be verbal, verbal communication is the most reliable form of asking for and gauging consent, and individuals are thus urged to seek consent in verbal form. Talking with sexual partners about desires and limits may seem awkward, but serves as the basis for positive sexual experiences shaped by mutual willingness and respect. Consent cannot be obtained from someone who is asleep or otherwise mentally or physically incapacitated, whether due to alcohol, drugs, or some other condition. Consent cannot be obtained by threat, coercion, or force. Agreement given under such conditions does not constitute consent. Consent must be clear and unambiguous for each participant throughout any sexual encounter. Consent to some sexual acts does not imply consent to others, nor does past consent to a given act imply ongoing or future consent. Consent can be revoked at any time. For all of these reasons, sexual partners must evaluate consent in an ongoing fashion and should communicate clearly with each other throughout any sexual encounter. For more information on "consent" contact the WoMen's Center.
