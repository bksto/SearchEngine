University of Michigan Compliance Hotline For reporting financial, regulatory, NCAA, and patient safety issues Home The reporting process Other ways to make a report FAQ Compliance Resource Center The reporting process To report a concern, you should first consider whether there are any conventional reporting mechanisms you can use—such as talking to your supervisor or a compliance specialist within U-M. See other ways to make a report for more guidance. If you feel uncomfortable reporting a concern through conventional channels, or wish to remain anonymous, then you can report your concern through the Compliance Hotline. This can be done by either calling the Compliance Hotline on 1-866-990-0111 or submitting an online report. The Hotline representative will ask you a series of questions in order to gather sufficient information for U-M to follow up. You will be asked to supply your contact information, but you may choose to remain anonymous if you wish. You should keep in mind, however, that certain types of reports may be difficult for the university to pursue if you choose to remain anonymous. The Compliance Hotline Call Center does not investigate reports, nor does it make any recommendations on the outcome. Instead, the call center documents the information reported, and routes that information back to compliance and/or audit personnel within the university. Your report will be handled as promptly and discreetly as possible. The relevant university office will evaluate the report, and follow up according to normal university procedures. This will include verifying the accuracy of the report. At the end of the call, the Hotline representative will supply you with a confirmation number, and ask you to call back in 14 days. Using the confirmation number, you can check the status of their report. The call-back feature also allows U-M officials to ask questions back to you, even if you reported your concern anonymously.       The Compliance Hotline is not for reporting criminal or medical emergencies.
