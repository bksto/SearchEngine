The library contains substantial collections of books, journals, government documents, videos, maps, and other physical materials, all listed in its online catalog, COAST. The library's Special Collections Department contains rare, significant, or unusual books, manuscripts, correspondence, art prints, and photographic prints. Our collections are enhanced through the LINK+ consortium, which makes an additional 7 million volumes available to everyone in the CSULB community. The library's subscriptions to thousands of web-based reference sources and full-text journals and its rapidly growing collection of electronic books make it possible to deliver a great deal of research information to the desktop at any time of the day or night. The staff and faculty of the Library/ATS organization are committed to efficient, helpful service, whether at circulation, the reference center, interlibrary services, BeachBoard Services (the University's course management system), or any of its other departments. The library's Spidell Technology Center, along with the Horn Center Open Access Lab (also part of the Library/ATS organization), provide more than 400 student computing workstations. The personnel of our Technology Help Desk extend supplemental desktop hardware and software support to the entire campus community. Our faculty librarians guide scholars through the process of identifying, retrieving, organizing, and evaluating sources of information appropriate to their educational needs or personal interests. The Library/ATS organization provides a wide range of library instruction opportunities to the campus community. For many students the first introduction to library services at CSULB is through the required library component of University 100, designed to introduce new students to basic concepts of information literacy. Librarians also provide a variety of workshops, as well as individual in-depth consultation focusing on a specific research topic. Library/ATS provides adaptive devices to make our print and electronic resources accessible to the disabled and works closely with Disabled Student Services to insure that equipment, facilities, and collections are responsive to special needs. Services offered by the Library and Academic Technology Services are described in more detail on our web site.   Website Index A B CA-CL CM-CZ D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z California State University, Long Beach 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 562.985.4111 Website Credits Feedback
