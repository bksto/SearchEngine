Over the next decade, the job market for engineering and science will continue to grow, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor projections. WPI is a smart investment. But don't just take our word for it. Here's what the experts are saying: Payscale.com ranks WPI graduates as having the 5th highest starting salaries among national universities. Members of the class of 2013 have received job offers from companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Bose, Dow Chemical, Google, Pfizer, Sikorsky, EMC Corporation, and ExxonMobil, to name a few. Starting salaries for the class of 2013 are 27 percent higher than the average, according to the National Colleges and Employers Association (NACE). Bloomberg BusinessWeek lists WPI as the No. 15 school for "return on investment" in the nation.

WPI consistently has over 90 percent job and/or graduate school placement upon graduation.
