Earl Warren College, founded in 1974 as Fourth College, was later named for the 3-term California governor and chief justice of the United States Supreme Court. His public leadership is remembered for the broad-based support he achieved during a period of U.S. history marked by dramatic changes. Despite the charged political climate, he swept the Democratic, Republican, and Progressive California gubernatorial primaries in 1946, winning him not only leadership of the state but a place in history. Appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower as chief justice in 1953, Warren presided over many significant cases. The most controversial of these was the landmark 1954 decision in "Brown v. Board of Education," which legally ended racial segregation in public schools.
