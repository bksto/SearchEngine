The GAP handbook provides background and rationale for Stanford's academic policies related to graduate students, defines certain university-wide requirements, and offers implementation guidance to describe how the various functions within the university work together to support the graduate student's academic progress. While recognizing that faculty are critically important as teachers, advisers and mentors, this handbook is designed primarily for university staff -- in school, department and program offices, and in the several central organizational units that support student administration. It should also be helpful to Department Chairs, Directors of Graduate Studies and others with responsibilities in this area. Within schools, departments and programs, some of the processes described here may be carried out differently depending on local circumstances and the particular facts of individual students' cases. The information contained here is university-wide in its scope, however, and should provide a starting point for local implementation. Using the GAP Background information is contained in a box on the right side of each individual document in this collection, including information about the source of the policy and its applicability, related policies and other resources. You will also find links to the current, applicable sections of the Stanford Bulletin. Where the current Stanford University Bulletin includes coverage of these topics, the current Bulletin is the governing policy. Stanford University reserves the right to make changes to its applicable policies, procedures and other materials contained here at any time and without prior notice.Links to the various chapters and documents within this GAP handbook will open in this browser window.
