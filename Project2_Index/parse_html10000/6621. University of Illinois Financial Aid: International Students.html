Office of Student Financial Aid University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Financial Aid Main Menu Cost The Process Types of Aid Resources Search   International Students Financial Aid If you are an international student, financial aid is generally limited to institutional aid programs provided by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and outside scholarships obtained by you through private sources. There are also limited opportunities for you to borrow a private loan; however, most of these loan programs require a U.S. citizen to serve as a co-signer. You are not eligible for the federal and state of Illinois financial aid programs. The federal and state financial aid programs require you to be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national (including natives of American Samoa or Swain’s Island), or permanent resident of the United States. Undergraduate Students You may be eligible for scholarships awarded by colleges or departments. Generally, there is no separate application needed for these scholarships. The department/college will review your admissions files and academic records and select scholarship recipients based on this information. Graduate Students Your application for admissions ensures consideration for all fellowships and assistantships administered by the University. Many departments make financial aid awards concurrently with admissions, so it is wise to have all materials in by the admissions deadline. Academic excellence is the first criterion in the selection of students for admissions and support, but grade point average is by no means the only measure. The entire application, particularly the letters of reference and your personal statement, guides the judgments of the committees that make decisions about fellowship awards and assistantship offers. Financial need is not usually a major consideration in awarding fellowships or assistantships at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Fellowships Most fellowships are awarded to students who begin their graduate studies in the fall. The Graduate College maintains an extensive, searchable listing of fellowship opportunities offered by the University and external sources. Campus fellowships are awarded only to full-time degree-seeking students. All awards are contingent upon available sufficient funding. Graduate students with campus fellowships also receive a waiver of tuition and selected fees. For more information, visit the Graduate College Fellowship Office website or contact them at gradfellowships@illinois.edu. Assistantships Teaching, research, graduate, and pre-professional graduate assistants receive stipends for services rendered to the University. To receive and hold an assistantship, a student must be registered for the semesters of appointment. Students whose assistantships require classroom teaching must be proficient in oral English as determined by current University verification standards (see the Graduate College handbook section VI.11). The appointment will be in effect only while the student remains in good academic standing. Questions regarding assistantships should be made directly to the appropriate department. For a partial listing of these assistantships, visit the Graduate College Assistantship Clearing House website. Scholarship Opportunities Any international student can search for scholarships from agencies outside the University on the Internet.
