Berkeley researchers lead the way in the "data science" that will accelerate scientific discovery.  UC Berkeley's scientific impact across the natural and social science domains reflects revolutionary techniques to collect, mine, and analyze unprecedented volumes and velocities of data. These achievements are augmented by our faculty's groundbreaking contributions in mathematics, statistics, computer science and machine-learning. The rapidly increasing importance of data-intensive and data-driven approaches at Berkeley has led to the establishment of a number of new programs. The most recent addition is the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) that is part of a collaborative effort supported by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The new 5-year, $37.8 million initiative was announced recently. BIDS programs will build on many existing campus strengths, including those of the centers and institutes highlighted below. Review the many additional campus efforts in data science here.   Institutes and Programs Berkeley Institute for Data Science The Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) promotes scientific breakthroughs by advancing interdisciplinary, data-driven discovery. Berkeley Institute for Data Science Simons Institute The Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing brings together the world's leading researchers to explore deep unsolved problems about the nature and limits of computation. Simons Institute AMP Lab Working at the intersection of three trends: machine learning, cloud computing, and crowdsourcing the AMPLab is integrating Algorithms, Machines, and People to make sense of Big Data. AMP Lab D-Lab D-Lab helps Berkeley faculty, staff, and graduate students move forward with world-class research in data intensive social science. D-Lab SDAV Institute The Scalable Data Management, Analysis, and Visualization (SDAV) effort supports breakthrough science by providing technical solutions that are broadly applicable. SDAV Institute EECS Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) is a top-ranked department in the nation, with many outstanding faculty combining science with the power of engineering. EECS Statistics In addition to developing fundamental theory and methodology, many faculty in the Department of Statistics have strong interdisciplinary links.
