At the Student Recognition Awards ceremony on April 7, 2014, three undergraduates were recognized for their commitment and effectiveness as peer instructors. Meena Lai-Mei Khayami, a Mechanical Engineering major in the Class of 2015, received the Peer Learning Assistant of the Year Award and $500 prize. Nominated by Professor Jon Abraham with support from numerous students, Meena is described as a phenomenal PLA in the Mathematical Sciences Department, exceeding the expectations of both students and instructors in calculus courses. Because of her exemplary teaching skills, her conference sections achieved nearly 100% attendance in the fall semester. She goes the extra mile to provide assistance and encouragement at all hours of the day and beyond her formal duties. One student wrote, “To be completely honest I would not have passed calculus and I would not be where I am today without her.” At the end of A-term, when students were told that Meena would be continuing as their PLA in B-term, an audible cheer rose up in the classroom, a tribute to her service to fellow students.   The following undergraduates also received PLA Achievement Awards: Aaron Benjamin, a tutor and MASH leader in the Academic Resources Center Arman Uygur, a tutor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department The PLA of the Year Award and PLA Achievement Awards were given for the first time in 2013, to recognize the significant contribution of all types of undergraduate peer learning assistants and tutors to high quality undergraduate education at WPI.  April 24, 2014   Academics Morgan Teaching and Learning Center About Us Resources for New Faculty Resources for All Faculty Resources for TAs & Supervisors News 2014-2015 2013-2014 2012-2013 Events Funding Opportunities Contact Morgan Teaching and Learning Center Chrysanthe Demetry, Ph.D., Director Gordon Library, Room 302 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5707 morgan-center@wpi.edu Related Sites Certificate in College Teaching Academic Technology Center (ATC) Center for Communication Across the Curicculum Project Advising Resources Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
