These figures vary depending on whether you are paying in-state or out-of-state tuition, whether you are a graduate student or undergraduate, and based on your housing option. Some of the figures used in the cost of attendance are averages derived from the Cost of Attendance Survey (COAS) administered by the University of California, Office of the President, and updated annually for inflation. Some of these figures are fixed (such as student fees, non-resident tuition, and on-campus room and board). Please use the cost of attendance tool to determine your cost of attendance.  The university’s accounts receivable billing system (known as Billing, Accounts Receivable, and Collections, or BARC) consolidates debts owed to the university, including fees, campus owned housing expenses, and library fines. Students receive a monthly statement of their account status whenever they have financial obligations to the university. Fee payment deadlines are published quarterly on the Registrar website at registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/calinfo.aspx. Qualified students are eligible for financial assistance in the form of scholarships, loans, grants, and/or work-study. For more information on UCSB financial aid, students can visit the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships website at: www.finaid.ucsb.edu.   {1} ##LOC[OK]## {1} ##LOC[OK]## ##LOC[Cancel]## {1} ##LOC[OK]## ##LOC[Cancel]## Quarterly Fees and Expenses Additional Fees Financial Aid Refunds Taxpayer Relief Act All provisions herein are subject to change without notice.
