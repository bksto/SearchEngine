Do You Supervise Represented Employees? If you are uncertain whether a position you supervise is represented: Review the appointment information in OACIS or in PPS Search the Salary Scales by job title classification to determine representation.  The Title Code System indicates whether a job title classification falls into a specific unit by code. (The campus often uses these codes as an informal reference for the bargaining units, e.g, CX, SX, TX) If a position is not represented by a union, the job title/position is non-exclusively represented (often referred to by the code "99") and is covered by Personnel Policies for Staff Members (PPSM).   Welcome Required Consultation Union Contracts Unions at UCSB Bargaining Updates Union Access Union Dues & Agency Fees Complaints & Grievances FAQs Contacts Useful Links Corrective Action Disciplinary Action Collective Bargaining Agreements Personnel Policies for Staff Human Resources Department University of California, Santa Barbara 3101 Student Affairs and Administrative Services Building (SAASB) Santa Barbara, CA 93106-3160 Hours:  8:00 - 12:00 and 1:00 - 4:00  Copyright © 2012 The Regents of the University of California All Rights Reserved.
