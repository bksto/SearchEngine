CITRIS was created “to shorten the pipeline” between world-class laboratory research and the creation of start-ups, larger companies and whole industries. CITRIS facilitates partnerships and collaborations among more than 300 faculty members and thousands of students from numerous departments at UCs Berkeley, Davis, Merced and Santa Cruz, with industrial researchers from more than 60 corporations. By leveraging one of the top university systems in the world with highly successful corporate partners and government resources, CITRIS works to find solutions for many of the concerns facing society today. Those include monitoring the environment, finding viable, sustainable energy alternatives, simplifying healthcare delivery and developing secure systems for electronic medical records and remote diagnosis, all of which will ultimately boost economic productivity.     The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
