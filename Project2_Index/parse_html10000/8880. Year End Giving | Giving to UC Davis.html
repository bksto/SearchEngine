UC Regents tax ID number: 94-6036494. Unless otherwise specified, all gifts are processed through the UC Davis Foundation. As the calendar year comes to an end, it can be a perfect time to make your tax-deductible donation to UC Davis. Here is some helpful information on how to make that gift so it will count for 2014 calendar year: All gifts must be United States Postal Service postmarked December 31, 2014 to be tax deductible for the 2014 calendar year.  The postmark must be United States Postal Service, not UPS, FedEx, or any other private courier service.     If you want to use a private courier service such as UPS or FedEx, gifts need to be received at 1460 Drew Avenue Suite 100 by 3pm on December 30, 2014 in order for it to be tax deductible for the 2014 calendar year. Hand-delivered gifts will be accepted at 1460 Drew Avenue Suite 100, but must be received before noon on December 31, 2014.  Gifts to UC Davis can easily be made online during the holidays via credit card by visiting our online giving site where you can find general or department’s specific online giving funds.  It is easy, secure, and you can give until 11:59pm on December 31, 2014 and it will still be tax deductible for 2014.  For any questions about year-end giving during the holidays, please call us at  530-754-4438 (GIFT). NEWS: IRA rollover is back for a limited time! On December 19, 2014, President Obama reinstated a law that allows you to make a tax-free gift from your IRA. If you've been waiting to make your IRA transfer, you must act right now to take advantage of this opportunity.  It’s Not Too Late Under the recently reinstated law, you may move up to $100,000 from your IRA directly to a qualified charity such as UC Davis Foundation without having to pay income taxes on the money. Known as the IRA charitable rollover, this law has been extended only to the end of 2014.  How It Works If you are 70½ or older, you can give up to $100,000 directly from your IRA to charities such as ours. The transfer generates neither taxable income nor a tax deduction, so you still benefit even if you do not itemize your tax deductions. If you have not taken your required minimum distribution for the year, your IRA charitable rollover gift can satisfy all or part of that requirement. The transfer may be made in addition to any other charitable giving you have planned. If you made a gift to a qualified charity of up to $100,000 directly from your IRA in 2014, your gift will qualify under the new law. If you have already made a qualifying gift in 2014, contact your advisor to make sure your gift is properly reported on your 2014 income tax returns. If you are interested in this unique opportunity to help further UC Davis, or if you have any questions, please contact UC Davis' Planned Giving Officers right away.  Brian Casey      Executive Director of Planned Giving      (530) 754-4105      bscasey@ucdavis.edu   John Koch      Senior Director of Planned Giving      (530) 752-8999      jfkoch@ucdavis.edu Kathy Lopez      Director of Planned Giving      (530) 752-2872      kplopez@ucdavis.edu UC Davis Development and Alumni Relations | One Shields Ave. | Davis, CA 95616 development@ucdavis.edu | Privacy & Accessibility | Sitemap | Last update: December 19, 2014 Copyright © The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus.
