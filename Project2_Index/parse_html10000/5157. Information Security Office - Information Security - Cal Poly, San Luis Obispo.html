Less common are emails asking users to reply with their username and password. DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINK OR REPLY TO THE EMAIL!  Visit our What is Phishing? page for details, including links to sample phishing emails.  Campus self-assessment forms are now available.  Responses from each area of campus will be via the Information Security Coordinators, and are due on May 31.   Important Links Identity Finder Software - Preventing a data breach starts with knowing where your sensitive information exists.  Identity Finder software can help you locate confidential data you may not be aware of and assist you with proper security or disposal.
