Commencement exercises are held rain or shine and are live-streamed at Harvard.edu/livestream. Journalists wishing to cover Commencement-related events at Harvard’s graduate and professional Schools, or the degree ceremonies at the undergraduate Houses, will need to contact the appropriate communications office.  Commencement Background Though Harvard was founded in 1636, the 2014 Commencement exercises will be only the 363rd. The first Commencement wasn’t held until 1642, and since then exercises have occasionally been canceled for reasons ranging from war to plague. Commencement at Harvard is composed of three components: the ceremonial Morning Exercises, during which University degrees are conferred; the midday luncheons and diploma-awarding ceremonies at the undergraduate Houses and graduate and professional Schools; and the afternoon annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association, during which Harvard’s president and the featured Commencement speaker deliver their addresses. A list of past speakers can be found here. Harvard Commencement is full of traditions: from the Middlesex sheriff calling the meeting to order to the president’s special chair. More about these traditions is available here. To learn more about Commencement, visit commencement.harvard.edu and http://www.harvard.edu/commencement.
