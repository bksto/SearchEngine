He needed a win against his opponent from Ithaca to snag the third and final qualifying spot in his 125-pound weight class but came up short.  That match was on Amato's mind when he took on Williams' Matt Morris in the third-place match at last weekend's NCAA Northeast Regionals in Bristol, Rhode Island.  "I definitely didn't want to take fourth again and not make it," Amato said. "That was my motivation, and I was happy about placing third."  Amato won two matches with third-period takedowns and became WPI's second NCAA qualifier in three years.Zach Hartzell made it in 2013.  "We're obviously happy," Engineers coach Steve Hall said. "He met expectations. He just got it done. He's a talented kid, there is no doubt about that."  Amato, who will compete in the NCAAs March 13-14 in Hershey, Pennsylvania, has had a great season. He spent most of the year ranked No. 1 in New England. He won the 125-pound title at the RIT Invitational, went 3-0 in WPI's Home Super Quad, and earned All-New England Wrestling Association honors.  "I took huge steps from last year," Amato said. "The work ethic, the time management, everything inside and outside of wrestling. I worked hard all year, and as the No. 2 seed (at regionals), I had high expectations. Last year as a freshman, I wasn't as confident as I am now. Having some experience under my belt really helped me."  Amato, a graduate of Newington High School in Connecticut, began wrestling as a third-grader. His dad, Sebby, was the wrestling coach at Trinity College.  Hall, a WPI Hall of Fame wrestler under legendary coach Phil Grebinar, was a freshman when Sebby Amato was a senior New England champion at Western New England College.  Story appeared in Worcester Telegram and Gazette - Wednesday, March 4th - http://www.telegram.com/article/20150303/COLUMN11/303039563/1009/SPORTS NCAA Div III NEWMAC Liberty League NEWA ECAC Impact Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road | Worcester, MA | 01609-2280 +1-508-831-5000 | athletics@wpi.edu
