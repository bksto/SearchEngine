It encompasses modeling, analysis and scientific computing for real-world problems arising in the natural sciences, social sciences and engineering. The Applied Mathematics program at UC Merced is led by a tight-knit group of young and energetic faculty. We have developed a truly unique learning environment, focused on a deep knowledge of the principles of applied and computational mathematics along with a broad understanding of how to apply those principles for understanding our world. We are enthusiastically committed to training both undergraduate and graduate students in research and education. As the first new American research university in the 21st century, UC Merced is one of the few places throughout the country that emphasizes state-of-the-art applied and computational mathematics. The emphasis on applied mathematics enables the program to foster the intellectual growth of individuals who are trained to use their analytical and computational skills to solve society’s most challenging problems of today and beyond.   Contact Us Graduate Admissions: Phone: 209-228-4723 gradadmissions@ucmerced.edu      Graduate Funding: Phone: 209-228-4622 gradfunding@ucmerced.edu      General Inquiries: Phone: 209-228-4723 Fax: 209-228-6906 graddiv@ucmerced.edu      Mailing Address: University of California, Merced ATTN: Graduate Division 5200 N.
