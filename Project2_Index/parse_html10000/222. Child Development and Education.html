California State Preschool Program & Center Based Child Care Program The Chaffey College Child Development Center provides a state of the art program for children between the ages of 18 months through Kindergarten. The Center is located on the college campus serving as a practicum site for child development students. The program follows the academic calendar of the college and is closed during the winter and summer breaks. We continually strive to use developmentally appropriate goals for young children as a framework for planning our educational program assessing children's progress in all aspects of the social, cognitive, and physical foundations necessary for success in elementary school. We emphasize diversity throughout our program, and our individualized, developmental approach lends itself to meeting the unique needs of the children in our program. Similarly, we utilize theories of adult learning to further the professional knowledge and skills or our apprentices/support staff that participate in our program. Location and Hours The Chaffey College Child Development Center is located on the corner of Haven Avenue and Wilson Street at the northwest corner of the Rancho Cucamonga campus.
