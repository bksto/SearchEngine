More on Open House Cal Poly and Santa Maria-Bonita School District Receive $1.8 Million Math Education Grant Cal Poly and the Santa Maria-Bonita School District received a $1.8 million California Mathematics and Science Partnership grant from the state Department of Education to fund a program aimed at improving elementary and middle school student achievement in mathematics.With this funding, Cal Poly will offer a three-year mathematics development program for local teachers called Central Coast STEM Institutes. The program will help teachers develop a curriculum that links mathematics to the real world."What we're trying to do is adapt the Cal Poly model of Learn by Doing into mathematics units for third- through eighth-grade teachers," said Kate Riley, a mathematics professor at Cal Poly who will lead the program.Over the course of three years, 76 teachers from the district will receive substantial instruction in mathematics content and best teaching practices. They will partner with Cal Poly education and mathematics faculty members to construct curriculum modules — a group of lessons that include a hands-on activity — for example, creating scale architectural models to understand ratios and proportions. The curriculum modules will also align with the new Common Core State Standards. More on grant Cal Poly’s Warren J. Baker Center Receives LEED Gold Certification Cal Poly’s Warren J. Baker Center for Science and Mathematics — the second largest building on campus — has been awarded gold for being green. The 189,000-square-foot structure, which opened for classes in September 2013, earned LEED gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council earlier in January. LEED — Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design — is the national benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. Certification means a building has met rigorous standards for sustainability, water and energy efficiency, resource selection and environmental quality. The designation brings the number of LEED-certified projects on the Cal Poly campus to four, representing nearly 30 percent of the campus’ 6 million square feet of building space. “We planned and designed the building for LEED certification and were reasonably confident that gold was accessible,” said Philip S. Bailey, dean of the College of Science and Mathematics. “What a joy to have it confirmed.” More on LEED Parsons Vice President to Serve as Visiting Cybersecurity Center Director Cal Poly and Parsons today announced that William J. “Bill” Britton, Parsons vice president for Cyber Strategy, will serve as the visiting director of Cal Poly’s Cybersecurity Center. In this role, Britton will be responsible for leading Cal Poly’s cyber initiative into a nationally prominent center that includes educational, research, outreach, and partnering activities. “Parsons is pleased that one of our top cybersecurity experts will be partnering with Cal Poly surrounding its initiative to become the leading supplier of cybersecurity professionals,” said Chuck Harrington, Parsons’ chairman and CEO. “Bill has more than 30 years of national security experience within both government and industry, and his sole purpose for the next two years will be to focus on Cal Poly’s cyber initiative and to help move it into the future.” The goals of Cal Poly’s cyber initiative—which includes hardware and software, facilities, and curriculum development—are to produce qualified graduates in computer science with a cybersecurity specialization as well as to educate them in advanced engineering, science, and business applications of cyber technologies and systems. The initiative is also aimed at preparing students for service in support of the national defense industry and intelligence community as well as for advanced study and applied research. More on Britton's appointment Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy Secures $1.2 million grant The Institute for Advanced Technology and Public Policy at Cal Poly was awarded $1.2 million in support of the Digital Democracy open government platform that will allow the institute to convert video of California legislative hearings into accurate and searchable transcripts that are freely available to the public. “State and local issues have become increasingly significant in today’s gridlocked federal government,” said Kelli Rhee, vice president of venture development at the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, which awarded the grant. “Digital Democracy provides the tools and information needed to search and follow relevant statehouse legislation, allowing the public to better understand how state policy decisions are being made.” Digital Democracy unlocks an entirely new data source: the full text of negotiations, debates and exchanges occurring within California’s Capitol. Until now, this information has not been available to the public, despite the fact that California’s 120 full-time lawmakers introduce an average of 5,000 bills each legislative session.

More on Fall 2014 Commencement Orfalea College Names Assistant Dean for Advancement and External Relations Cal Poly’s Orfalea College of Business recently named Mary Kelting as the college’s new assistant dean for advancement and external relations. Kelting will oversee the college’s communications and fundraising efforts in addition to growing the Dean’s Advisory Council with Dean Scott Dawson. Kelting formerly served for more than two years as the director of development for the university’s Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship (CIE). She was instrumental in building significant financial and community support for the CIE as it introduced new programs. She also successfully rallied a network of entrepreneurs who have supported and advised the CIE and its student entrepreneurs to achieve notable success. More on Mary Kelting Cal Poly Mustang Mascot Name Honors Past President Margaret Chase Cal Poly has chosen a name for its live mustang mascot: Chase. This name will be the ceremonial title under which all current and future members of the Cal Poly Mustang Herd will serve the university. The name honors a pivotal figure in Cal Poly history: Margaret Chase, the university’s second president and the only woman so far to hold the post. Chase served on an interim basis for one year, 1924, between the resignation of Nicholas Riccardi and the appointment of Benjamin Crandall. Her impact on the university, though, lasted much longer. Chase came to Cal Poly in 1908 as a member of the English faculty. Under Riccardi, she served as vice president and head of the Academic Department — a position similar to today’s provost, the university’s No. 2 job. In that role, she was instrumental in securing Cal Poly’s accreditation from the University of California. Catherine Trujillo, a curator at Cal Poly’s Robert E. Kennedy Library and the mother of a Cal Poly freshman, submitted the winning entry. She was inspired by two connotations of the word. “It is a metaphor to encourage our community of scholars to always pursue and chase after their dreams,” she said in her submission. “It is also a throwback to our campus history and the powerful women who helped Cal Poly become what it is today.” More on Chase Cal Poly Adds $1.4 Billion to Region’s Economy, New Study Shows Cal Poly contributes more than $1.4 billion to the economy of San Luis Obispo and Northern Santa Barbara counties, according to a new analysis prepared for the university. “Cal Poly is a vital and positive economic force on the Central Coast,” said university President Jeffrey D. Armstrong. “It is one of the region’s top employers and most stable employers, helping the area weather economic downturns.” According to the study, Cal Poly students also contribute to the community’s economic vitality. Not only do the more than 19,000 students purchase goods and services from local businesses, they also pay more than $11 million in local taxes while providing more than $2 million in volunteer labor to a host of nonprofit organizations from Paso Robles to Santa Maria. The university “plays a key role in generating, developing and stabilizing the region’s economy,” said the report, which analyzed Cal Poly’s contributions to the region based on economic data collected in the 2012-13 fiscal year. The 60-page study was conducted by San Luis Obispo-based Productive Impact LLC. To read the full report, visit http://research.calpoly.edu. More on the economic study Peter and Mary Beth Oppenheimer Pledge $20 Million to Cal Poly — Largest Cash Gift in University’s History Cal Poly has announced the largest cash gift ever received by the university, a $20 million donation by Peter and Mary Beth Oppenheimer to the College of Agriculture, Food & Environmental Sciences. Their gift will be used to build critical new facilities for the college and modernize many of the existing teaching units in the Animal Science Department. The Oppenheimers will also continue to support areas of ongoing need, such as the Cal Poly Scholars program, as well as the university’s meal voucher program and the new Food Pantry to help alleviate hunger on campus.  More on the Oppenheimers' gift Cal Poly Set to Update Master Plan for Future Campus Development Cal Poly announced it is preparing to update its plan for developing the campus over the next 20 years to meet student educational needs and the local, state and regional demand for its graduates. The university is beginning a two-year process to update the campus master plan, which will determine physical needs and guide future development of the lands, circulation systems and facilities necessary to support the university’s Learn by Doing mission.   The master plan update process will include extensive engagement of the campus and San Luis Obispo communities and numerous opportunities for public input and involvement. In addition to scheduling several events to encourage public involvement, the university has established community and campus advisory committees. The six committees include a cross section of campus and community representatives and will provide thoughts, ideas and input related to policy direction.The public is invited to attend two initial public workshops to discuss and learn more about the master plan process on Wednesday, Nov. 5, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Kennedy Library atrium on campus and on Saturday, Nov. 15, from 10 a.m. to noon at the Ludwick Community Assembly Room, 864 Santa Rosa St., in San Luis Obispo.  More on the Master Plan Cal Poly Shares $1 Million Grant to Fund Citizen Science Astronomy Research Cal Poly and the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., have received a $1 million collaborative grant from the National Science Foundation to continue a citizen-scientist astronomy project in rural communities in the Western U.S. stretching from the Mexican border to the Canadian border. More than 40 towns along the eastern edge of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges and down the Colorado River will receive telescopes and training through the grant. The towns in this second phase of the project will join 13 pilot communities to form the Research and Education Collaborative Occultation Network (RECON). Scientists John Keller, a Cal Poly physics professor, and planetary scientist Marc Buie will lead the network of teachers, students and amateur astronomers in measuring the sizes of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) — large, frozen bodies that orbit the sun in the outer region of the solar system. “This project is an innovative and exciting opportunity for students and community members from across the Western U.S. to directly contribute to our understanding of the Kuiper Belt,” said Keller.
