At UCLA, 275 of our physicians are listed among the "Best Doctors in America," while the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is consistently ranked among the top five hospitals in the nation and the “Best in the West” for the 23rd consecutive year. The Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA is setting the global standard for pediatric care — offering procedures, technology and advances that bring in children from all over the country. Locally, the recently remodeled UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica offers Santa Monica's only inpatient pediatrics unit, pediatrics ICU and emergency department approved for pediatrics. Featuring the most advanced medical technology in the world, UCLA's Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital is among the leading centers for patient care and education in mental health and neurology. Perhaps this is why U.S. News and World Report consistently ranks it among the "Top 10" facilities nationwide.
