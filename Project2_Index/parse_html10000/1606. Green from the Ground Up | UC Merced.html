Its designs and plans – down to the smallest detail – embody the word “sustainability”. All of UC Merced’s buildings have or will achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, meaning they meet or exceed standards for sustainability in design and operations. UC Merced is the only American university with every building on campus environmentally certified. As of summer 2013, we have: One silver LEED certification Eight gold LEED certifications Two platinum LEED certifications Five platinum certifications pending Conservation and sustainability are part of the fabric of the campus and evidence can be seen everywhere. As of the 2012-13 school year, UC Merced had reduced its per capita water use by 43 percent since 2007. Individual staff and faculty member and student use went from 22,564 gallons a year to 13,290. That’s already almost 4,761 gallons under the goal of 20 percent reduction set by UC President Janet Napolitano for 2020. Purchasing procedures reward vendors who can enhance the campus’s commitment to sustainability, the landscaping is designed for maximum efficiency, smart energy-monitoring systems in buildings help keep usage and the environmental footprint to a minimum, and some of UC Merced’s most important research focuses on sustainability, from solar energy and ecology to climate change. UC Merced many practices across campus enhance its sustainability. Other initiatives include: A recyclable take-out dining system at the Yablokoff-Wallace Dining Center that is projected to save the campus thousands of pounds of packaging each year; Campus purchasing practices that promote the acquisition of items made from recycled materials and use minimal packaging; A 1 megawatt solar-panel array that helps power the campus; Campus water stations that allow people to refill water bottles, rather than buying new ones Also a part of our green-campus goal: land conservation. Through a special collaboration with the Packard Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the Nature Conservancy and the state of California, the campus set aside 25,000 acres of grassland habitat for permanent conservation, 6,500 acres of which comprises the new Vernal Pools-Grasslands Nature Reserve, open space adjacent to campus that will be used for research and community outreach, but never developed.   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
