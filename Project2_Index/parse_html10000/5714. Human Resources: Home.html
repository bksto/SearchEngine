Organizational Charts Contact Us HR Monthly Digest   Human Resources Fire Update March 5, 2015 On February 18th an electrical problem caused a fire in the attic space of the HR building.  No employees were harmed in the fire, and we did not lose any documents. As a result of our nightly backup process, no data was lost.  Thanks to C&C and BAS IT all HR systems and staff were back online within 5 hours. The building cannot be occupied in its current state, and therefore HR staff have been temporarily relocated. Within moments of the fire, our neighbors at UNEX offered us temporary space to house several of our HR units in the immediate short term, and others will be housed in the Surge building. During this period of time our phone numbers will remain unchanged, and interoffice mail can be sent to HR at Surge 310C.  If you have a meeting scheduled with HR staff, please check your calendar to confirm the location as we have made alternate arrangements for those meetings which were scheduled to take place in the HR building. Many people contributed to our ability to rebound so quickly from this situation. We want to thank the entire campus community for the outpouring of support and assistance we have experienced. We are extremely proud to be part of this caring campus community.  At this time we do not have a public lobby. If you have questions, we encourage you to use our HR website and utilize the contact emails and phone numbers.   Update: Anthem Data Breach Anthem, Inc. has created a website (AnthemFacts.com or AnthemInforma.com for the Spanish-language version) to allow current and previous members impacted by the recent cyber attack on Anthem to enroll in two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft repair services. Previous UC Anthem members (those enrolled during the last 10 years in the UC-sponsored Anthem Blue Cross PPO, PLUS, Lumenos, Core, the Medicare Core, PPO, and High Option plans, as well as UC Student Health plans administered by Anthem) with questions should visit Anthem’s website for more information. Anthem has also established a dedicated toll-free number for individuals to call if they have questions related to this incident. That number is (877)-263-7995. Phone lines will be open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT Monday to Saturday. Anthem had previously indicated that they would not be sending information to impacted members via e-mail. We have now received an update from Anthem indicating that members who have provided e-mail addresses to Anthem and have opted in to receive electronic communications may in fact receive an e-mail directing them to visit AnthemFacts.com to sign up for services. This e-mail, sent due to state notification requirements, is scheduled to be distributed the week of Feb. 16. The e-mail will not ask for personal information and will not contain a link to any websites other than AnthemFacts.com. Letters to impacted members via USPS are still planned for the coming weeks. UCOP has also updated the information about this event on UCnet at http://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2015/02/important-information-for-former-anthem-members-about-recent-cyber-attack.html.   UC and Teamsters Settlement of Unfair Labor Practice Charges related to Counseling Memos containing Disciplinary Language On January 28, 2015, the Teamsters and the UC entered into an agreement (attached) settling two unfair practice charges filed at other UC campuses involving counseling memos which allegedly contained “disciplinary” language. The settlement includes a thirty (30) day period (January 28 through February 27) for employees in the CX unit to request that counseling memos which contain language which they believe is disciplinary be amended to exclude such language.   UC Policy and collective bargaining agreements for the vast majority of our represented staff specifically state that counseling memos are not discipline. Counseling memos are intended to document oral coaching and counseling provided by a supervisor in response to an employee’s poor conduct or performance. It has been the consistent advice of UCR’s Human Resources that counseling memos not appear to be disciplinary actions. To this end, the UCR HR website includes a template (Counseling Memo - Sample Letter) for supervisors to use when issuing counseling memos. Notably, this template does not refer to the discipline/corrective action policy/contract provisions; does not characterize the action as ‘discipline’; and does not articulate disciplinary consequences for continued similar conduct/performance. As such, we do not anticipate there will be many requests for amendment to counseling memos on our campus. We expect that employees may request to view their personnel files and may possibly request amendments to counseling memos contained therein. Any requests to amend counseling memos should be referred to Employee & Labor Relations. Going forward, please ensure that counseling memos for all employees do not include disciplinary language. Employee & Labor Relations staff are available to review any such memos prior to issuance. If you have any questions, please contact the Employee and Labor Relations Office at (951) 827-3641. Thank you.   Anthem Data Breach On February 4, 2015, Anthem, Inc. was the target of a very sophisticated external cyber attack and data for its 80 million members was accessed. The University has been in contact with Anthem and has confirmed that information about UC students, faculty, staff and retirees, as well as their dependents, has potentially been accessed. Once the attack was discovered, Anthem immediately made every effort to close the security vulnerability, contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and began fully cooperating with their investigation. These cyber attackers gained unauthorized access to personal information for current and former members, such as their names (employees, retirees, students and their dependents), birthdays, member health ID numbers/Social Security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information such as the UC campus or medical center location. Anthem has informed us that the data in the IT system that was breached contained information on members from 2006 to present. Anthem’s investigation to date indicates there is no evidence that banking, financial or medical information, such as claims, test results, or diagnostic codes were targeted or compromised. Anthem will enroll members affected by the attack in identity repair services and impacted members will be provided information on how to enroll in free credit monitoring. Anthem has developed a dedicated website and an FAQ that provides the most updated information on the Anthem breach. Additional information specific to UC can be found on UCnet. IMPORTANT:  Anthem will be contacting current and former members via mail delivered by the U.S. Postal Service.  Anthem will not be calling members directly, nor will Anthem be emailing members. Members should beware of scam email campaigns (or phishing) disguising to be Anthem, see example here.   Bargaining Bulletin: UC Reaches Agreement with IUOE Skilled Crafts Unit On December 10, 2014, representatives of UC and IUOE Local 501 came to a tentative agreement on a successor contract covering Skilled Crafts Unit (K5) staff. The bargaining unit members ratified the agreement on December 12, 2014. The multiyear agreement for this bargaining unit will be posted to the HR website as soon as it has been finalized by the parties. HR will provide training for those responsible for administering the contract. Questions about new provisions should be directed to Alex Najera at x2-4721.   Career Tracks Career Tracks is a system-wide job classification structure initially targeted for non-represented staff employees that will be implemented at all UC locations. The Career Tracks framework aligns jobs with similar positions internally and in the external marketplace. Career Tracks supports the development of career paths that enhance career mobility and helps focus development activities for employees. For more information, you are welcome to visit the Careers Tracks website.   News Archive Organizational Charts Human Resources is responsible for managing the overall Organizational Chart process for the UCR campus.
