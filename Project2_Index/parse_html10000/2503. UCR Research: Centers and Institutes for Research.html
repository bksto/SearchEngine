For Each Field of Study, a Place to Thrive UCR’s research centers and institutes are nationally recognized. The broad range of topics that span three colleges within the university and Research and Economic Development. Find a home where you can produce your life’s work at: Bourns College of Engineering The College of Engineering features four research centers that are addressing diverse topics such as nanoscale material so small that the human hair seems gigantic in comparison to the car of the future and its impact on the global environment. The four centers are: Center for Environmental Research and Technology See Profile Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Ubiquitous Communication by Light Center for Research in Intelligent Systems See Profile College of Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences The nine research centers and institutes featured within the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Science support investigations into everything from the history and contributions of Native Americans in California to emerging family issues to the causes of and possible solutions to youth crime and violence in our society. No matter their specialization, scholars in the CHASS centers and institutes undertake the challenges of understanding individual ideas and phenomena, as well as exploring their roles within larger society.
