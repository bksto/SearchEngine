Directory information is publically searchable from the main UC Davis website and is also shared by the campus operators by dialing (530) 752-1011 or "0" from a campus telephone. Information may be updated continuously throughout the year. If you wish, you may elect to make your contact information searchable through campus computers only. The Printed Campus Directory Published in early 2008, the 2008-2009 Centennial Edition was the last printed UC Davis Campus Directory. The publication was discontinued upon the availability of the online version. The move online saves money and paper, and the electronic format lets people update their listings anytime, which keeps the directory more accurate. Directory Approvers The individual and department contact information in the online directory is maintained by directory approvers. Updates to contact information for individuals may be initiated by each individual, but it must be approved by department and campus-wide directory approvers before becoming available to the public. Updates to department contact information are submitted by each department's directory approver to Directory Services in IET - Communications Resources for campus departments or the Telecommunications Office at the UC Davis Health System for Sacramento campus departments.
