The last two years are when most of the specialization takes place. There are, of course, exceptions: some students know very early in their careers what they will major in. Some, indeed, wish to add a more explicitly professional component to their studies. The specialized College majors and minors, and the various cross-school and pre-professional programs, allow students to prepare themselves for many different roles. Welcome!
