Visit the ITS Core Accounts website for a description of accounts that are subject to automated account maintenance/purge. Students: Upon graduation or after not attending classes for three (3) quarters. Graduate students who have applied for and been accepted for a future quarter will not be targeted. Students working to complete projects after graduation MUST submit an Exemption Request. Faculty: After not having taught a class in four (4) months. Staff: When the Cal Poly Human Resources system reflects a non-current status. ASI/Foundation/Auxiliary: When they are no longer sponsored by their organization. Affiliated Persons: After the end date on the Affiliated Person Request Form on file. Affiliated Person Request forms must be submitted annually. Emeritus Persons: Upon their death. Accounts are not transferable to others. Club Accounts: When they are no longer recognized by ASI and are no longer in the Cal Poly Directory. Departments and Committees: When they are no longer officially sanctioned or recognized by the University. Account Purge Process Three days after the account owner is no longer current in a Cal Poly Human Resources system, an email is sent to advise that Cal Poly computing accounts will be locked in two (2) weeks and deleted in four (4) weeks. Accounts will automatically be targeted throughout the year based on the eligibility requirements referenced above. This will be the only email notification that is sent. Also at this time, the Cal Poly Directory record will be suppressed. The computing accounts will be locked two (2) weeks after the person is ineligible and the initial email is sent. Accounts can be temporarily unlocked for “emergency” account management. To request this, contact the ITS Service Desk at 805.756.7000 or servicedesk@calpoly.edu. Accounts are deleted two (2) weeks after they are frozen. Accounts that have been purged/deleted cannot be restored. Purge Exemptions Exemptions from purge can be requested using the Affiliated Person Request Form. Please note that Exemption/Affiliated requests require budget “chart field” information and administrative approval. You must plan ahead and submit a completed form to avoid service interruption.   Service Catalog Services for the Campus Find the technical services you need, get more information or find help in the Service Catalog.
