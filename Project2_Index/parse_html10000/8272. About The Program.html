The new joint transfer program from the California Community Colleges and the California State Universities makes it easier for students like you to transfer between the two school systems. For the first time in California history, community college students who complete a new AA-T or AS-T will be guaranteed admission to the California State University (CSU) system. With this new degree, you have the opportunity to complete two degrees with only 120 units if you apply and are admitted into a similar degree program. × Community College Contacts Community college counselors and advisors are available at each of our 112 campuses across the state. Check out our Contact List to find an office near you. × Guaranteed Admission The Associate Degree for Transfer Program guarantees that a student with an associate degree for transfer will be admitted to a CSU campus. The degree does not guarantee admission to a specific campus or major so students should work hard to be academically competitive when applying to popular CSU campuses outside their local area and to popular majors. Through the new program, students who complete an AA-T or AS-T will be given a special GPA advantage when applying to CSU impacted campuses or majors. × CSU System The CSUs open to you will vary based on your location and your major. Get more details on which CSUs will be open to you on our Details page. The best part of the deal? Students with an AA-T or AS-T enter the CSU system with junior standing. Students who are admitted to a program that has been deemed similar will need only 60 more semester units (or 90 quarter units) to complete a bachelor's degree. This website is designed to explain the guarantee, and help you identify an AA-T or AS-T that might be right for you. To get started on your AA-T or AS-T, or for more information, check out a community college website, or visit a counseling office to learn about how the joint transfer program can help you achieve your education goals.
