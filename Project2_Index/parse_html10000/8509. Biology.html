Managing emerging pests and diseases as well as those becoming resistant to current controls, describing and utilizing and conserving biological diversity in the face of habitat loss and climate change, designing more effective treatments for traumatic injuries and degenerative conditions and developing biofuels to help meet our growing energy needs while maintaining our capacity to produce food are just a few of the challenges facing our nation and our world. That’s where biology, the largest and fastest growing scientific discipline, comes in. Advances in biology – in fields such as biotechnology, medical research and genetic engineering – improve the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people and lead to the development of stress-tolerant crops, new chemotherapy drugs, more sensitive techniques in forensic science and the use of bacteria and plants to clean up pollution. But there’s still so much to learn and accomplish. What makes the biology program at the University of Redlands special? Our biology courses emphasize science as a way of learning through laboratory and field-based experiences. These experiences involve our students in practicing scientific thinking by posing testable questions, designing small-scale research projects, collecting, analyzing and interpreting data and presenting findings. These experiences also allow our students to gain technical skills. Significant research opportunities include paid summer internships and academic projects during the school year. Research projects span many subdisciplines of biology and take advantage of our state-of-the-art laboratories and wide array of habitats within easy reach of campus. Approximately half of our majors have significant research experience by graduation. As a biology major at Redlands, you’ll have the opportunity to build a solid foundation of scientific knowledge and research skills to help solve some of today’s most challenging and rewarding problems.
