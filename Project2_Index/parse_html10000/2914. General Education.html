It is, as the Association of American Colleges & Universities notes, a critical component of a “high quality education that develops intellectual and ethical capacities; expands cultural, societal, and scientific horizons; cultivates democratic and global knowledge and engagement, and prepares graduates for successful participation in a dynamic and rapidly evolving economy.” A well-planned General Education program of study will provide students with the skills they will need to excel in whatever disciplines they choose to pursue. The links below provide further information on the importance of General Education, as well as information on requirements and approved courses.
