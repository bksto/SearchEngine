In combination, these policies and procedures are designed to inform non-represented employees about the expectations and entitlements of the University with regard to their employment. Represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and not PPSM. Personnel Policies for Staff Members (PPSM) The Systemwide Personnel Policies for Staff Members (PPSM) covers positions not represented by a union, the job title/position is non-exclusively represented (often referred to by the code "99").  When researching an issue or topic in PPSM, be sure to consult both the Systemwide PPSM and the Local PPSM, where applicable.  As public sector employees, UCSB staff are considered to be employed by statute. The University by authority of the Chancellor reserves the right to amend, modify or delete these policies at any time and they supersede all previous University staff personnel policies. Local Personnel Policies for Staff Members (Local PPSM) The UCSB Local Personnel Policies for Staff Members provide additional guidance and implementing procedures for the Systemwide Personnel Policies for Staff Members (PPSM). Use the menu on the left to find Local PPSM policies. Please note:  there is not a Local PPSM Policy provided for every Systemwide PPSM Policy. We only implement a local policy or procedure where necessary.

There are thirteen collective bargaining units (CBU) on the UC Santa Barbara campus. Systemwide Collective Bargaining Agreements Unions at UCSB Code CBU Union/Employee Organization CX Clerical Unit International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT or Teamsters) SX Service Unit American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME) TX Technical Unit University Professional & Technical Employees (UPTE) RX Research Support Professionals Unit University Professional & Technical Employees (UPTE) PA Police Officers Unit Federation of University Police Officers Associations (FUPOA) NX Nurses Unit California Nurses Association (CNA) EX Patient Care Technical Unit American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME) HX Health Care Professionals Unit University Professional & Technical Employees (UPTE) IX Non-Senate Instructional Unit American Federation of Teachers (AFT) LX Librarian Unit American Federation of Teachers (AFT) K8 Skilled Crafts Unit International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 501 (501) BX Academic Student Employees United Auto Workers (UAW) If you are uncertain whether a position is represented: Review the position information in OACIS or in PPS and look for the representation code (see Unions at UCSB for more information on codes). (The campus often uses these same codes as an informal reference for the bargaining units, e.g, CX, SX, TX) Search the Salary Scales by job title classification to determine representation.  The Salary Scales indicate whether a job title classification falls into a specific unit by code. If a position is not represented by a union, the job title/position is non-exclusively represented (often referred to by the code "99") and is covered by the University's Personnel Policies for Staff Members (PPSM)   Additional University Policies UC Office of the President Policy Home Page UCSB Campus Policies & Procedures UCSB Academic Personnel Policies Overview Types of Appointments Employment Compensation Leaves Separation Actions Complaint Resolution Useful Links Systemwide Personnel Policies for Staff Members (PPSM) Systemwide Collective Bargaining Agreements UC Office of the President Policy Home Page UCSB Campus Policies & Procedures UCSB Academic Personnel Policies Human Resources Department University of California, Santa Barbara 3101 Student Affairs and Administrative Services Building (SAASB) Santa Barbara, CA 93106-3160 Hours:  8:00 - 12:00 and 1:00 - 4:00  Copyright © 2012 The Regents of the University of California All Rights Reserved.
