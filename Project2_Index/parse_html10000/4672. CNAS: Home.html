Droser and her former graduate student Tracy J. Thomson have published a report in the journal Geology that concludes a unique combination of factors in Early Triassic delta systems resulted in the production and unusually widespread preservation of the swim tracks of tetrapods (four-footed land-living vertebrates). Factors include delayed ecologic recovery, depositional environments and tetrapod swimming behavior. The Early Triassic period followed the largest mass extinction event in Earth’s history.

Chari’s research paper “Characters and blocks for finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras” (along with a coauthor) ranked 3, while her paper “Braid group actions and tensor products” ranked 21. Chari is an expert in representation theory, a fundamental area of mathematics used to understand abstract algebraic ideas by representing them as matrices.
