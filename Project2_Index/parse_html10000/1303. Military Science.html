The rumors that the ASTATE ROTC Program is closing are NOT TRUE!!! Last October, the U.S. Army announced that it would be closing some 13 ROTC programs nationwide. While this program was on that original list, that decision was rescinded some 45 days later. ASTATE ROTC is not closing. We are NOT on probation and we are in great shape to continue to produce high-quality officers for the Army, Army National Guard and Army Reserve as we have for the past 78 years. So, we invite and challenge you to join in that tradition and be a leader. You will find the benefits well worth your simple commitment to attend Military Science classes. There is no military obligation for the first two years of classes. You have nothing to loose and everything to gain including money for college, excellent fitness, great fun, great friends, respect, a guaranteed job and great career after college as well as some cool uniforms to name a few things.  For questions, please feel free to call us at 870-680-8064.  ASTATE Red Wolf Battalion The Arkansas State University ROTC Program is dedicated to developing quality leaders for America's Army. Since the Army holds education as such an important aspect of leadership, it has invested in developing leaders by funding the training needed to facilitate quality leaders. Scholarships and other Financial Aid are available to students seeking higher education. ROTC Develops Leaders ASTATE ROTC has a proud 78-year history of producing top quality leaders who have gone on to hold high paying jobs, public office, and high ranking military positions. Cadets find their full potential and become overall better citizens by commissioning into the Active Duty Army, Army National Guard, or Army Reserve. Video not playing? Download file instead.
