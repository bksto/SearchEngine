What are the average student expenses? What payment options are available? How much does it cost to attend CSULB? Tuition and fees consist of the basic registration fee and other University activity and facility fees. The amount a student must pay is based on the following: Undergraduate or Graduate standing Number of units attempting (0-6 units is a reduced fee) California residency status For more information regarding Registration Fees, see Fees and Charges. Students enrolling for classes through College of Continuing & Professional Education (CCPE) pay costs based on a separate fee schedule. Contact CCPE for more information. What are the average student expenses? Average student expenses vary depending on living arrangements. The table below shows the estimated costs of attendance used to determine eligibility for financial aid for Undergraduate Students* for the 2015 - 2016 academic year. Students' actual costs may differ. The figures for Tuition & Mandatory Fees displayed below reflect the amounts for the 2015 - 2016 academic year—in effect as of March 1, 2015. The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fees, without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by The Board of Trustees.

An Installment Plan is available for those who need to spread their fees over multiple payments, and there are also a limited number of short-term loans to assist students with fee payment. Contact the Student Financial Services for more information. Students receiving financial aid may be eligible for a Financial Aid Fee Deferment which enables a student to postpone payment of class registration fees until their financial aid is disbursed. If for some reason a student does not complete the financial aid process or is found to be ineligible for financial aid, the financial aid fee deferment will be cancelled, and the student will be responsible for submitting payment by the fee payment deadline. Students who file their financial aid application (either the FAFSA or the California Dream Act Application) after March 2nd may be required to pay fees with their own funds.
