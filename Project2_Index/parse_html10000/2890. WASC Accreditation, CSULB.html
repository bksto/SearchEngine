In conducting its review, the evaluation team assessed the university under the WASC Commission Standards and Core Commitments and submitted its report for action by the WASC Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities. The Commission is slated to act on the report in February 2011. CSULB's accreditation self-study was a multi-stage, longitudinal process that required broad campus involvement. Over a five-year period, the university developed an institutional proposal, a capacity and preparatory review report, and an educational effectiveness review report. These materials are available for review at http://www.csulb.edu/projects/wasc/archives.htm. This web site was created to serve as an electronic archive for the documents CSULB submitted to WASC as well as the accreditation-related documents received from WASC.
