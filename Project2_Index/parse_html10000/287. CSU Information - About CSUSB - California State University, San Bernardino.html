Its 23 campuses and five off-campus centers, serving more than 400,000 students, extend from Humboldt State in Arcata in the north to San Diego State in the south. The individual California State Colleges were brought together as a system by the Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960. In 1972, the system became the California State University and Colleges, and in 1982, it became the California State University. Today, the campuses of the CSU include comprehensive and polytechnic universities, and, since July 1995, the specialized California Maritime Academy. The oldest campus—San Jose State University—was founded in 1857 and became the first institution of public higher education in California. California State University, Channel Islands is the newest CSU campus, opening in fall 2002, with freshmen arriving in fall 2003. Responsibility for the California State University is vested in its Board of Trustees, whose members are appointed by the governor of California. The trustees appoint the chancellor, who is the chief executive officer of the system, and the presidents, who are the chief executive officers of their respective universities. The CSU offers more than 1,800 bachelor's and master's degree programs in some 240 subject areas. A number of doctoral degrees are now offered by several campuses, as well as some offered jointly with the University of California and with private institutions. There are more than 417,000 students enrolled at the 23 campuses, with some 22,000 faculty. The system offers about half of the bachelor's degrees and a third of the master's degrees granted in California. Nearly 2 million people have been graduated from California State University campuses since 1960.
