UCSC graduate students earn advanced degrees in more than 40 programs. And our campus is also a place with an uncommon dedication to undergraduate students enrolled in more than 60 majors. The relatively small size of our campus’s graduate-student body provides tremendous opportunities for students at all levels. Graduate students establish close relationships with faculty mentors, and our undergraduates have unique opportunities to work on major research projects, side-by-side with graduate students and faculty.
