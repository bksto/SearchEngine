Jump to Navigation Center for Climate Communication A Project of the Sierra Nevada Research Institute Home   Welcome to the Center for Climate Communication   The Center for Climate Communication conducts and promotes research on communicating climate issues, including climate variability and adaptation. We examine the meaning and presentation of climate reports from varied sources, such as TV news, social media outlets, governmental agencies, corporations and scientific laboratories. We study how the content and mode of presenting climate information influences how the general public reasons about uncertainty and risk, for instance, risk related to extreme events and conditions, such as wildfire, drought, and flooding. We work with varied stakeholders -- from different agencies, from different social and cultural groups and from different geographical regions -- to develop better ways to talk about and think about climate issues. We host and participate in outreach activities, and actively seek funding to support our research and educational activities.

Our first workshop topic is "Water and Drought," and will be held on the UC Merced campus on November 21st, 2014. For more information about the workshop you can check out its webpage here.   Center for Climate Communication kicks off new C3 talk series The goal of our talk series is to reach out to the public to discuss ways to better commnicate about climate and environmental issues.   For further information on the C3 talk series, email ccc@ucmerced.edu.     Andy Hoffman at UC Merced The first C3 presentation, held April 30, 2014, focused on the role of values and culture in forming and maintaining beliefs about climate. Previous Pause Next On April 30, 2014, we held our inaugural presentation for C3, the Center for Climate Communication talk series. Well-known author and University of Michigan Professor Andrew Hoffman discussed how scientists don't always get the final word in public debate on climate change because people often develop positions that are consistent with the values of their own cultural groups. You can watch the video below:   Hoffman is the Holcim professor of Sustainable Enterprise and director of the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan. Hoffman's research, mentioned in Time, Scientific American, the New York Times and many other notable media outlets, uses a sociological perspective to understand the cultural and institutional aspects of environmental issues. After his UC Merced visit, Andy took a motorcycle tour of Yosemite National Park. To read about his trip and reflections on his visit, read his blog.   Our second C3 talk is scheduled for 3 p.m. Sept. 8, 2014, with Professor Michael Ranney of UC Berkeley.
