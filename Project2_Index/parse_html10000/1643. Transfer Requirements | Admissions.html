UC Merced accepts junior level students.   Step 2 - Major Preparation: These are lower division courses which can be completed in your first two years of college work. Major preparation is one of the central factors UC Merced uses to determine your admissions to the University. This course work is required for graduation in your specific major and fulfills prerequisites for upper division courses at UC Merced.   Step 3 - General Education:  Although not a requirement, completing lower division general education requirements prior to transfer will aid your progress towards graduation. IGETC, the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum, is accepted by the School of Natural Sciences at UC Merced but, is only specifically suggested by the School of Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts. If you are majoring in engineering, the School of Engineering recommends that you do not complete IGETC. It is not required that you complete your lower division general education courses prior to transfer; however, this course work must be completed prior to graduation from UC Merced.   Helpful Preparation Resources In addition to the information provided in our web site, below are some useful tools to help you prepare to transfer.
