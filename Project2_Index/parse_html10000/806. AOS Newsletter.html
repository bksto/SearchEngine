In this issue you will find AOS News, Awards, Research, Events, Alumni updates, a graduate student interview, and a staff interview. This first newsletter isn’t a comprehensive representation of all the news that AOS has produced in the past year or years, so if you think of something that should be on the next newsletter please contact Geoff Girard (310) 825-4654 girard@atmos.ucla.edu and supply him with the news item. If you are an alumni of AOS (or know someone who is an alumni) we would love to hear from you and include you in a future newsletter and AOS announcements. Please send us a couple of paragraphs on what you have been doing since graduation and a picture if you have one, and you can send your information to Geoff Girard at the contact numbers listed in the previous paragraph. This first newsletter is the work of our two work-study students, with Ingrid Channa doing the bulk of the work on layout and graphics and Lillian Pham as our intrepid reporter. Thanks to both of them for their work on this. Best wishes for the New Year, Rob Fovell Chair Jochen Stutz Vice-Chair in the department the latest news, events, and research in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences Mechoso Earns Doctor Honoris Causa Professor C. Roberto Mechoso was honored with a Doctor Honoris Causa from the Engineering School of the Uniersity of the Republic, Uruguay for his internationally recognized work in dynamics and numeric modeling of the atmosphere and brilliant academic career on October 3, 2014. Panelists noted Mechoso's academic career, his more than a hundred refereed publications, and his recognition by numerous universities and professional associations. They also highlighted his leadership of numerous international research projects amoung which VAMOS (Variability of the American Monsoon Systems) and VOCALS (VAMOS Ocean, Clouds Atmosphere, Land Study) within the World Climate Research Programme of the World Meteorological Organization, stand out. Bea Gallardo-Lacourt wins CEDAR Prize Congratulations to graduate student Beatriz Gallardo for winning the 1st place student poster award on Ionosphere-Thermosphere at CEDAR, using THEMIS data (see: Summary). Her poster was titled: “Ionospheric Flow Structures Associated with Auroral Beading at the Substorm Auroral Onset.” She received the book “Ionospheres: Physics, Plasma Physics, and Chemistry” courtesy of co-author Bob Schunk (USU) who signed the book. Bea’s work showed that extremely large, small-scale flows develop in precise assocation with each auroral bead (strong intensification) that is seen along the brightening auroral arc at substorm onset. This demonstrates critical features of the physics of the substorm onset process. Kuo Nan Earns AGU Roger Revelle Medal In 2013, Professor Kuo Nan Liou earned the AGU Roger Revelle Medal “for outstanding contributions in atmospheric sciences, atmosphere ocean coupling, atmosphere land coupling, biogeochemical cycles, climate, or related aspects of the Earth system.” Professor Liou accepted the Medal on December 11, 2013 at the AGU fall meeting in San Francisco and gave an acceptance speech to an audience of more than 2000. Alex Hall on Television UCLA’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Professor, Alex Hall presented his “Climate Change in the Los Angeles Region” study on episodes of the climate change documentary series Years of Living Dangerously, which aired on Monday, June 2nd on Showtime at 8 PM. Dr. Wen Li Congratulations to Dr. Wen Li who won an URSI Young Scientist award, and in fact was ranked as the #1 young scientist from the US. She has also been elected as the Early Career Representative for Commission H in URSI and will be serving for the community for the next 6 years. This means URSI will support her to attend all URSI-related meetings during this time and she will do some business work to help promote Young Scientists and help the Chair and Vice-Chair write Radio Science Bulletin. Dr. Toshi Nishimura Congratulations to Dr. Toshi Nishimura of AOS/UCLA, who received the Obayashi Young Scientist Award from Japan’s Society of Geomagnetism and Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences (SGEPSS). Toshi received this award as a result of his ground-breaking research on a variety of topics including energy flow to and from the ionosphere within the inner magnetosphere; fundamental, long-standing questions on the processes leading to an causing substorms; and the causes and magnetospheric source regions of pulsating and diffuse aurora, using THEMIS ASI data. Aradhna Tripati earns E. O. Wilson Award The E. O. Wilson award from the Center for Biological Diversity is an award dedicated to recognizing ground-breaking conservation research. Aradhna Tripati is recognized for her “innovative research on climate change and ocean acidification” and “commitment to conservation and public outreach” Jonathan Mitchell earns Greeley Early Career Award UCLA Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences assistant professor Jonathan L. Mitchell received the 2013 Ronald Greeley Early Career Award in Planetary Science at the 2013 AGU Fall Meeting, held 9–13 December in San Francisco, Calif. The award recognizes significant early-career contributions to planetary science. The Greeley Early Career Award is named for pioneering planetary scientist Ronald Greeley. Ron was involved in nearly every major planetary mission from the 1970s until his death and was extraordinarily active in service to the planetary science community. Ron’s greatest legacies, however, are those he mentored through the decades, and it is young scientists whose work and promise the award seeks to recognize. We at the department would like to congratulate Johnathan on this award and achievement. UCLA Scientists' Key Role in the Santa Ana Wildfire Threat Index Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences professor Robert Fovell, along with doctoral student Yang Cao and postdoctoral researcher Scott Capps were part of a research team that developed a new tool to classify the fire threat potential of hot, dry Santa Ana winds. The three performed modeling of Santa Ana wind events dating back decades. "This effort has led to an enhanced understanding of the evolution of the Santa Ana winds, their potential for sparking and spreading fires, and their spatial and temporal variation," said Fovell. "We not only have a new, deeper understanding of how the San Diego-area terrain influences weather, especially wind, which is crucial to SDG&E's operations, but we also have been able to make improvements in weather modeling that will benefit forecasters around the world." read more... Phys.org Highland Community News 89.3 KPCC-FM Bio Medecine EurekAlert UCLA News Air Quality Results of a Freeway Closure We all suspect that the air quality near freeways probably isn’t the best. But did you know that shutting down one small section of a freeway could create better air quality up to a hundred miles away? In the latest issue of ACCESS Magazine, Arthur Winer, Yifang Zhu, and Suzanne Paulson show that both local and regional air quality dramatically improved during the 405 freeway closure in their article, “Carmageddon or Carmaheaven? Air Quality Results of a Freeway Closure.” The authors measured emissions and air pollutants both near the freeway closure and several miles away. They found that the reduced traffic levels dramatically improved both the local and regional air quality, up to one hundred miles away. To improve local and regional air quality on a more permanent basis, the authors urge policy makers to promote ultra-low and zero-emissions vehicles and provide alternatives to single-occupancy driving. read more... Climate Change in Key Coastal Regions In a new study, UCLA Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences professor Jim McWilliams and assistant researcher Lionel Renault will make the first detailed models predicting how climbing temperatures will affect the coastal climate in the four regions. The project is supported by a $2 million grant received this month from the National Science Foundation. The effect of climate change on the oceans has been vastly understudied, say the researchers — and these regions should be of particular interest given the world’s dependence on them for their populous, species-diverse habitats. As one of the world’s leaders in ocean modeling and evaluating climate change, UCLA is well positioned to create the foundation for a true physics-to-fish understanding of how climate change could alter these areas. AOS Awards Banquet The annual Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences Fall Awards Dinner was held on November 13, 2014 at the new Carnesale Common’s Palisades Room. The event was well attended by our students, faculty, staff and special guests. Award winners were announced during the dinner and were asked to say a few words. Yizhe (Peggy) Bu is the Jacob A. Bjerknes Memorial winner for academic excellence; Neil Berg, Baird Langenbrunner and Daniel Russell are the Morris Neiburger Memorial Award winners for outstanding teaching; and Daniel Dauhajre received the Brian Bosart Graduate Student Award for unselfish service to fellow students and positive contributions to departmental life while demonstrating a firm commitment to academics. Congratulations to all of our 2014 AOS award winners! the yanai lecture with syukuro manabe senior meteorologist Ph.D | Princeton University thurs.may 7th, 2015 5pm reception 6pm lecture royce hall, rooms TBA It was about 25 years ago, when we published a result from a numerical experiment of global warming, in which atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide increases gradually with time. The model used for the experiment is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, in which so-called, general circulation model of the atmosphere is combined with that of ocean. We found that the geographical pattern of global warming exhibits a marked and unexpected interhemispheric asymmetry. In the circumpolar ocean of the Southern Hemisphere, a region of deep vertical mixing, the increase of surface air temperature is very slow. In the Northern Hemisphere of the model, on the other hand, the warming of surface air is faster and increases with increasing latitudes, with the exception of the northern North Atlantic, where it is relatively slow because of deep vertical mixing and the weakening of the overturning circulation. The trend analysis of observed surface air temperature over the last several decades also exhibits similar interhemispheric asymmetry. I will discuss the physical mechanism of the interhemispheric asymmetry, referring to the studies that have been published since the publication of our paper. PEOPLE alumni discover the latest updates from the department's almni Daniel Cusworth “After I graduated in 2012, I moved out to Boston and worked for the environmental consulting firm, The Cadmus Group. In the Fall of 2013, I started a Ph.D in Earth & Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. I am advised by Daniel Jacob and Loretta Mickley in the Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling Group. My research has focused on climate-chemistry interactions, with an emphasis on how aerosols have impacted regional climate in the central United States.” Sarah Kapnick “I’m presently a postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University and NOAA/GFDL and will be transitioning to a new position (physical scientist at NOAA/GFDL) at some point in 2015. I have a recent paper that has been highlighted in popular press. The Princeton press release can be found: here Spencer Hill “I finished my AOS/applied math double major in June 2011 and began my Ph.D. work in AOS at Princeton three months later. I’m now in my 4th year of the five year program working with my advisor, Dr. Yi Ming of GFDL/Princeton AOS, on tropical circulation responses to climate change. My ultimate goal is a research career in AOS; as such my mental radar has begun scanning for postdoc opportunities. I’m frequently yearning for the Los Angeles climate, and I’m ever appreciative of my time in UCLA AOS, which inspired me to pursue this path and trained me well to do so.” Brad Spitzer “After graduating with my joint degree in Mathematics and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, I took the route less traveled and joined Deloitte’s Financial Advisory practice. I traveled around the United States consulting large companies on issues ranging from Bankruptcy, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Valuation, M&A, and Forensic Investigations. After realizing that I am not motivated by money, I decided to switch careers into something a little more interesting. Currently I am back living in Westwood and working in Beverly Hills doing Data Analytics for construction rental companies. My company Rouse Analytics provides a benchmarking service that allows our clients to adjust their rates depending on market conditions. Even though I am not doing anything currently in the Environmental field, I always try my best to share the knowledge I gained from the UCLA A&O department. I look forward to taking my understanding of large data and applying it to studies relating to wave height, temperature, and other studies related to atmospheric or oceanic phenomena.” Featured People AOS Staff Kara Leung What is your spirit animal? The platypus—it is an amalgamation of separate parts put together. It doesn’t make sense, but it works. A platypus is always puzzled; it is an anomaly. Also naked mole rats because they’re amusing and I like Kim Possible. How many languages do you speak? English, Ebonics, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Spanish (un poquito). I’m always trying to learn more languages, especially Swedish (Nordic people were always the best in the world). Places Traveled: Mexico, Hong Kong, and Tokyo (it’s easier than going to Wyoming or something because of my food palate is accustomed to East Asian foods). Foodie? I didn’t know what pesto was but I love Asian food. I’m mostly unaware of BBQ and American food. Parents: My great grandfather moved to Mexico from China, and he had a ranch (remarried in Mexico). Parents came from Mexico to the States, so I have Chinese, Mexican, and American roots. What did you go to school for? Global Studies with emphasis on social economic and political spheres of Middle East at UCSB. I saw a need to be study the Middle East, with geopolitical conflict rising up there. But towards the end of my college career I was more interested in Philosophy (continental philosophy). If you were to go back to school it would be…? Philosophy and Political Science with game theory and net rational theory. Everything I like is theory-based because I feel like theory is always ahead of practice. “Theory lies the foundation of practice, and it pushes a lot of things. The metaphysics of things is much more interesting than the metaphysical things.” How did you end up in IT? I was doing tech support with Pictage, and after a week they noticed my work in tech support, so I worked my way up. I went from tech support to a higher tier and was there for two years. How did you build your computer skills? I built my first computer at 12/13. I was interested in video games and became more interested in how things work How’d you end up at UCLA? Just applied online What are your hobbies? Combat sports (MMA, boxing, etc), video games (Counter Strike, Mass Effect, LOL, DotA), and learning a new languages. What is your favorite book? While I’m currently reading The Elegant Universe: String theory & Physics, it’d be The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Enders Game, and Tupac’s The Rose That Grew from Concrete. Malcolm X provided a new perspective on the rights movements and painted his social awakening of his race and race politics. It shows he became conscious of race issues amongst a world of racial segregation and the normality of it. The book is fascinating because you see this guy literally change in his different understandings of the world and of people, and still held onto his convictions. What is your favorite movie? Too many movies. Life of Pi, 12 Angry Men, Butterfly, In the Mood for Love, Space Balls, Le Jatee, Dogma, Control Room, and The Square. Philosopher? Derrida has influenced me. He takes a new approach to presence and absence of writing and speech. I learned about deconstruction and other ideas. I like his mental gymnastics, but his wordplay and ideas are the most fascinating. One word characteristic/trait: It is hard to distill ones essence in one singular word—is there a word that holds that much power? A word only holds so much. Any language can’t describe an inanimate object in a single word (I embrace post-structuralism movement. But “eclectic”, if I had to. What are your favorite foods? Bun Vit Xao Mang, Hu Tieu, and Pho Ga. Vietnamese is really my favorite, since I’m accustomed to Vietnamese traditional cuisines. Go-to restaurant? It just depends on the occasion, a person, and what they’re in the mood for. It’s too hard to say, so I don’t like questions like this. Kraft in Century City if I really had to choose, but I wouldn’t recommend it as someone’s first time in the States, just go to In-N-Out. What’s your favorite color? Clear, it lets you see into things, like a window. Dream-Career? (rationality aside) Combat sports athlete, as an adrenaline junkie. Current addiction? With strong self control, there’s no need to be addicted to things. Do you like cronuts? I don’t have a sweet tooth at all; I’m more of a salty person. How do you like to be perceived? As open, friendly person. What’s favorite part about IT? Operation and development; they’re the nuts and bolts and things. They’re the behind the scenes people. You have star developments, but not star operations people. I enjoy working behind the scenes to be like a thief. What challenges do you have that you like? Troubleshooting strange issues, because it’s enjoyable to dig into what’s going on. Piecing things together is like finding answers to the puzzle. What do you know about AOS? Before I came here I knew nothing, but at least I know they do mathematic modeling because we don’t deal with it. We don’t know how the tools are being used but we fix the tools that are being used. What do you think about the AOS dept.? Things move well, and I have a great respect for the faculty and researchers. I am a firm believer in______. There are too many things to say I’m a believer in, but I don’t like existentialist ideas—there is more to life than just existing. 3 Facts: Used to be a line cook back in college (which attributes to foodie-ness) Used to play video games competitively (one of the three teams for the US 2008 ESWC Grand Finals for Counterstrike My mom and I share the same birthday Graduate Student Daniel Dauhajre How did you end up at UCLA? After senior year when I did research with Jim McWilliams. Where did you study for undergrad? I’m from South Florida, but I graduated in 2011 from USC with a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering for undergrad. Although undergraduate years were spent with medically-based coursework, I always had a sense that I wanted to work on scientific and problems that had a physical scope greater than the human body. I found research positions to help feed my interests in the ocean, yet remained in biomedical engineering due to the broad nature of the coursework. The research time at USC was an invaluable experience which helped me decide I wanted to work on the dynamical aspects of oceanography. Why are you interested in AOS? I am interested in science in general. In particular, the ocean. I have always had this innate interest in the ocean ever since I was a little boy just looking out into the ocean. I am also interested in the climate field and change field. The climate field in particular is an interesting discipline; it is popular, has a lot of social utility, and is relevant. There are two sides to research that I find interesting; there’s the joy of figuring something out but it is also useful as well. What’s your favorite thing about the ocean/AOS department? Surfing is my hobby, so in general the vast ocean has always been interesting to me. The AOS department is unieque in that it seeks to find answers to relevant problems and creates greater awareness of the ocean, climate, and our world. What are you researching? I am studying Physical oceanography – particularly coastal dynamics. I am looking at what the shelf current regime is and how currents on the shelf relate to the shelf zones and transport from the shelf to offshore water. (ROMS –Regional Oceanic Modeling System) The modeling we do is very high resolution and we can capture high resolution ocean models with our ROMS. In the AOS department, I am constantly researching and asking questions to uncover physical phenomenon. I’m also researching the transport of coastal dynamics. What do you do in your spare time? I try to spend as much of my time surfing and at the beach or outside when I’m not working.I’ve made it a goal to handshape the rest of my surfboards. I also enjoy hiking, photography, and AOS camping trips. Daniel’s Website: Click here The Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) at UCLA has been at the forefront of atmospheric research and education since its inception in 1940. Today, AOS strives to gain a better understanding of climate change and improve climate change prediction methods by incorporating both theoretical and practical knowledge. Our internationally award-winning faculty researches the most compelling and transformative issues of our time, including climate change, greenhouse warming, air pollution, and increasing severe weather phenomena, as well as satellite remote sensing, atmospheric chemistry and physics, and marine ecosystems. AOS research and theoretical modeling are often used to inform and guide policymakers’ decisions on environmental policy and regulations. Major Areas of Research Climate and Weather A pioneer in the efforts to establish numerical models of the Earth’s atmospheric circulation, our researchers continue to make substantial contributions to our understanding of a wide range of climate and weather phenomena ranging from El Nino to Santa Ana winds, on time scales ranging from tomor- row to the future our children will inherit. Air Quality To better understand the causes and effects of local and global air pollution, our faculty monitors the air around petro-chemical facilities and freeways, participates in collaborative surface and airborne field studies, studies agricultural dust in the air and ocean, and investigates the chemical processes in the atmosphere using sophisticated computer models. Space Weather Our interdisciplinary space physicists explore the near-Earth space environment that affects electronic systems in space and on the ground, and seek to understand how dynamic events and structures affect the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmosphere. Ocean Our researchers are focused on understanding a multitude of internal oceanic processes as well as their roles in climate, the carbon cycle, and marine ecosystems. This done by modeling, data analysis, and measurements, including the areas along the regional coast and its underlying sediments.
