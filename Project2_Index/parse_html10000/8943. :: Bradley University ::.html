"This is a wonderful announcement for Congressman LaHood, for central Illinois and for Bradley," said President Joanne Glasser. "He is uniquely qualified to serve as Secretary of the Department of Transportation because he understands the nation's infrastructure needs and understands that bipartisanship and civility are necessary for the country to move ahead. "For many years, Congressman LaHood has been a great friend to Bradley; his commitment to the University has been extraordinary. For me personally, he has been a close friend and adviser since the day I arrived. "I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Congressman LaHood and applaud President-elect Obama on this wise choice." LaHood is the second Republican to be nominated for a Cabinet post by the president-elect. President George W. Bush's Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, will remain in his position. The last Republican to serve in a Democratic Cabinet was Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen. Obama pledged during his campaign to name Republicans with a reputation for bipartisanship and a network of relationships on both sides of the aisle. After graduating from Bradley in 1971 with a degree in sociology, LaHood taught junior high social studies in Peoria before going to work for Congressman Tom Railsback in Rock Island. LaHood was then appointed to fill a vacant seat in the Illinois General Assembly. In 1982, LaHood began working for U.S. House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel '48 HON '81, first running his Peoria office and then serving as his chief of staff in Washington. LaHood was elected to Michel's 18th Congressional District seat in 1994. After seven terms, LaHood is retiring from his post at the end of the current session. Twenty-seven-year-old Aaron Schock '02 was elected in November to fill the seat. FRED ZWICKY/JOURNAL STAR Then-Democratic U.S. Senator-elect Barack Obama meets with Republican Rep. Ray LaHood at LaHood's Federal Building congressional office to talk about the lay of the land in Washington, D.C., in 2004. "It's a great point of pride for Bradley University," said Brad McMillan, executive director of Bradley's Institute for Principled Leadership and former District Chief of Staff for LaHood. "We have a rich history of leadership coming out of the University from Bob Michel, the longest standing House Minority Leader, to Gen. John Shalikashvili ['58 HON '94, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997]. "And Congressman LaHood has done an outstanding job representing the area in Congress for the last 14 years. "To be appointed to one of the highest-level Cabinet positions is truly an honor. It's something all Bradley alumni, students and faculty should take great pride in." LaHood is an active and committed Bradley alumnus. A longtime donor and strong advocate for his alma mater, LaHood is also past president of the Bradley University Alumni Association. He served on the Bradley Board of Trustees from 1999 to 2006. He was named the 2008 Distinguished Alumnus at Founder's Day in October. The Department of Transportation oversees the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. Established by Congress in 1966, it has about a $65 billion annual budget. "The Department of Transportation is not just roads and bridges," McMillan said. "It's airports, the river, ports and railroads. When you talk about agencies in Washington, its reach is enormous. The good thing about Ray is he'll do this in a fair, honorable and principled way and make sure it's done the right way. That's all we can expect from our public servants." The Peoria Journal Star reports LaHood is the first Peorian nominated to a Cabinet position. According to the newspaper, no Peorians have held presidential Cabinet positions before, but two central Illinoisans have served as Secretary of Agriculture: Edward Madigan of Lincoln (under George H.W. Bush), and John Block of Galesburg (under Ronald Reagan).
