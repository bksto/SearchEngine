Be they from members of our administration, our faculty and staff, or even our students, the successful operation of the university requires the contributions of a variety of unique individuals. UCR’s chancellor is Kim A. Wilcox. He assumed the post in August 2013 and is assisted in the day-to-day operations of the university by Provost & Executive Vice Chancellor Paul J. D’Anieri. UC Riverside's administrative organizational structure features four vice chancellors whose offices oversee specific areas and who report directly to the chancellor. These are: Office of the Vice Chancellor for Finance & Business Operations Under the direction of Charles Rowley, the office oversees the day-to-day financial and business operations of the university in support of its academic mission. Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research Under the direction of Vice Chancellor for Research and Economic Development Michael Pazzani, the office oversees a variety of campus research centers and research units and assists with research funding and grant proposals . Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Under the direction of James Sandoval, the office oversees UCR’s large and diverse student-body and the more than 30 programs that provide resources to aid students' personal, academic and professional growth. Office of the Vice Chancellor for University Advancement Under the direction of Peter Hayashida, the office enhances public awareness of UCR's achievements and generates financial resources for the university. Independent from the other bodies is the Office of Campus Counsel. From advice in developmental policy to conflict resolution, the Campus Counsel provides continuing legal guidance to UCR’s leadership. The Academic Senate serves as the representative body for the UCR faculty. By definition, all faculty are members of the Academic Senate, with officers coming from a variety of backgrounds across campus. The Senate is responsible for the selection and ratification of courses, admissions conditions and faculty members. The Senate also advises the chancellor and campus administrators on some of the most critical decisions made at UCR.
