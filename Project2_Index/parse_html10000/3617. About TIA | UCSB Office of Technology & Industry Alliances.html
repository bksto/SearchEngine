Our goal is to build effective, long-term and mutually-beneficial relationships with our industry partners. TIA was one of the first university technology transfer offices to have full delegation of authority to negotiate and execute both licensing and research agreements. Our ability to negotiate both licensing and research agreements eliminates the need for our corporate partners to progress through multiple university offices and gives TIA the opportunity to build an in-depth understanding of the needs of our industry partners. It also allows TIA to simultaneously negotiate licensing and research agreements, when appropriate.
