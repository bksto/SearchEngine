Faculty Home Best Practices DE Calendar DE Committee Help and FAQs Faculty Evaluation Process Log on to Moodle Resources Training Help Desk Information DE Site Map   Online and Hybrid Classes Online classes are attended exclusively on the Internet; there are no regular on-campus meetings. However, some online classes do require specific dates or times or interactive Internet class activities. Instructors provide details of these and other requirements in the class syllabus. Students should log on to the college course management system (Moodle) AFTER noon on the first scheduled day of the class. Hybrid classes are a combination of online and classroom instruction. Students meet with the instructor at the designated location on the stated days and times throughout the term. The first face-to-face meeting will take place the first scheduled week of the class. Students should refer to the schedule of classes for the class meeting dates, times, and location. Waitlisted or Adding? As students who are waitlisted or who are hoping to add an online class are unable to physically attend the first class meeting, a waitlist or adding process has been developed. To find out how this process works, please visit the Waitlisted or Adding page.
