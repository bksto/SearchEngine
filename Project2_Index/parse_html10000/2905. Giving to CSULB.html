Twice! Yes, that's the way it works. And with a CSULB charitable gift annuity, you not only receive the satisfaction of helping to further the mission of the University, you will receive annuity payments for the rest of your life. Where to Give From 49er Athletics to the University Art Museum, we welcome your generous support. Ways to Give There are several ways in which alumni and friends may contribute to CSULB: online, mail, phone, stocks and securities, planned gifts, matching gifts and payroll deduction. Annual Fund Although Cal State Long Beach is a publicly supported institution, generous contributions to the Annual Fund are critical to keeping the University thriving. Why Give? Private support is increasingly important as the state contributions to the overall budget of CSULB have fallen below 50%. Learn more about Charitable Gift Annuities...
