We provide support services, specialized equipment and educational accommodation to students with disabilities so they can participate fully and benefit equitably from the college experience. To qualify for support services, one must be enrolled at Crafton, have a verifiable disability that results in an educational limitation that inhibits the student's ability to participate in the general offerings of the college without additional specialized services and must have the ability to benefit from instruction. Support services may include: Disability Related Counseling Learning Disability Testing Class Test proctoring Priority Registration Texts in alternative formats (e.g. etext, braille) On-campus transportation and mobility assistance Specialized Equipment Sign Language interpreters and closed captioning Notetakers Assistive technology (e.g. screen readers) DSPS Online Orientation The DSPS Online Orientation provides more information about DSPS and the services offered by the program. In addition to a introduction to the program the orientation provides information about the types of students served, services offered and the requirements and expectations for students interested in receiving services from DSPS.
