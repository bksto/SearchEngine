Hampton Foundation, through Wesley G. Hampton, Roger K. Hampton, and Katharine H. Shenk CURRENT EXHIBITION Jessica Rath: A Better Nectar January 27 – April 12, 2015 Jessica Rath: A Better Nectar is an expansive multisensory installation based on the tender co-evolutionary communication between flowering plants and their pollinators. Rath uses sculpture, light, and sound to consider how bumblebees learn and remember multisensory floral signals to find better nectar. Visitors are provided with a human-scaled experience of a bee’s intimate sensorial journey from its underground nest to an audibly and visually pulsating world, based on the Rath’s research and discussions with the scientists at Leonard Bee Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno. For more information about Jessica’s research and production for the show, visit her “bee blog.” Consumed January 27 – April 12, 2015 Curated by the CSULB Museum Studies program, Consumed artists China Adams, Jedediah Caesar, Gabriel Kuri, Mary Mattingly, and Camilo Ontiveros explore the past, present, and future implications of mass consumption. By upholding the position that consumerism is one of the major causes of an environmental crisis, the exhibition simultaneously critiques and acknowledges the compulsive, cooperative relationship that exists between consumerism and society today. For more information, visit the Museum and Curatorial Studies page. MOCA 8 The Permanent Collection exhibition, MOCA 8, showcases the University Art Museum’s first edition prints of the famed portfolio “Eight by Eight to Celebrate The Temporary Contemporary,” gifted to the museum as part of the Gordon F. Hampton collection. Mr. Hampton was a veteran trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art and it was through the Gordon F. Hampton Foundation and his family, that his collection was gifted to the museum. Also on display are recent gifts from The Andy Warhol Foundation and The Sam Francis Foundation, two artists who contributed to the “Eight by Eight” portfolio.
