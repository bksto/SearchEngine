Vision The University Art Museum provides a forum for the investigation of contemporary visual culture and seeks to transform the traditional art museum experience, from the ordinary to the extraordinary and personal. About the UAM The University Art Museum, located on the campus of California State University, Long Beach, is a unique cultural institution that champions new and often challenging ideas through wide-ranging exhibitions and provocative programs. Begun as a significant campus gallery in 1973 and accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in 1984, the UAM remains an important resource in the field of visual arts for the largest comprehensive university system in the nation. The UAM curatorial vision focuses on tension and interplay at the nexus of contemporary art and society. The UAM program of dynamic solo exhibitions and landmark group presentations define key moments in contemporary art, reflect the global nature of art today, and span a vast array of cultural activities and media. Through dedication to scholarly and artistic excellence, the UAM has earned a reputation for its high-quality exhibitions and award-winning publications. The museum also plays a vital role in training future museum professionals, art educators, arts administrators, and artists. Ranking among the top ten-percent of the nation’s 16,000 plus museums, and praised as one of the top museums in the state by the California Arts Council, the UAM maintains a permanent collection of site-specific outdoor sculpture, works of art on paper, and the Gordon Hampton Collection of American painting and prints, that have brought recognition to the university and the city of Long Beach. © 2014 University Art Museum | CSULB STAY CONNECTED!
