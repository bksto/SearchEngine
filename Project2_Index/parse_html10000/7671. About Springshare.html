Home  /  About Us Our mission is to develop engaging web applications for libraries and educational institutions. Why should others have all the fun? We are committed to helping libraries create great online experiences for their patrons. Springshare was founded in 2007 by Slaven Zivkovic, an ed-tech entrepreneur with a history of library innovations (and a history of working at libraries too - Slaven spent his undergraduate years as a library student assistant at his college library). Together with the select group of like-minded "Springys", the crew is creating cutting-edge library web apps and setting new standards for great customer service. Today, we're among the fastest growing library technology vendors, serving 4,800 Libraries in 78 countries. We're proud to serve libraries large and small - from many of the most prestigious universities worldwide to small community college campuses, public libraries of all sizes, special and government libraries, and many school and district libraries too. And the best part is, we're just getting started! Interested in Joining Team Springshare? We are always on the lookout for bright, energetic folks to join our ranks.
