But they particularly describe the perpetual movement of our students as they achieve their academic goals. The college experience seems to pass ever so quickly and then our graduates move onward. In this series we will present the stories of some of our recent graduates who are moving on as many before them have. Here we will offer their perspectives on their early steps away from the Hilltop and onward to first jobs or graduate school.   First job takes him back to the nation’s capitol From Joshua Cox ’09, Political Science major When I came to Bradley in 2005, I thought I had everything figured out.  I was going to be a marketing major and go into sports marketing.  After just one semester, however, life decided that political science and advertising would become my career fields of choice. Like most 2009 graduates, I took my diploma at graduation without a job waiting for me and without any strong leads for any future direction.  I left Carver Arena with bittersweet feelings about entering the real world and leaving everything I knew for four years. What followed after graduation was three long months of passionate job searching with just a few interview breakthroughs along the way to help give me hope. I had my first interview with The Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars, an organization that provides college students with exciting internship and academic opportunities in Washington D.C. for credit from their home institutions.  I had the opportunity to participate in The Washington Center’s seminar program in 2008 along with another Bradley student, and I was excited at the prospect to now come full circle and take my first job with the very organization that gave me my first real taste of life in the nation’s capitol. The transition from Bradley to the real world was an interesting experience.  As if making the transition was not difficult enough, making it as a person who has lived in the country all his life in a city that never stops just added to the challenges.  Once I got my footing, things really took off, and I have been able to thrive in a city that has so much to offer.  I have told many of my friends who are still in school that the biggest thing that I have learned after leaving Bradley, is the true value of the weekend!  After working for 5 days a week, those two little days at the end of the week go by so fast. I often wonder where they went and it doesn’t seem fair. But it’s nice not to have to write an essay on my weekends either!  Making a transition from carefree, stay-up-late, sleep-until-noon college student is a difficult one. But, after a while, it is easy to adjust to a new way of life and one that is better in a lot of ways. My title at The Washington Center is Program Coordinator in Institutional Relations.  It basically means I work in the department that establishes and maintains relationships with colleges and universities around the country.  The most exciting part of my job is getting to coordinate all the social media outreach that I studied at Bradley.  I manage TWC’s Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter accounts which are linked at the bottom of TWC’s main website (www.twc.edu).  I recently started shooting and editing videos at TWC’s many events to post on YouTube, which is something I had never really considered doing while studying at Bradley. I consider myself very lucky to have found such a great job, working with great people, for a great goal in a still struggling economy.  There are a lot of people at BU and family in Illinois that I have to thank for helping me be prepared for such great challenges in this real world. I have learned a lot about myself and what I aspire to do along the way.  I wish all the future BU grads the best of luck in their endeavors after graduation. February 4th, 2010 in Onward | No Comments Creating magical memories From Eric Swanson ’09, Business major After four years of education I found myself after graduation standing at the threshold of that great experience some call life, with fear and joy overwhelming me. I did not know if the real world would eat me alive or if the past four years of education would give me the tools to tame the beast. I entered the real world in May of 2009 only to load up my car and journey to the “Happiest Place on Earth.” I had taken an internship position with the Walt Disney Company at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. Setting off on a journey from the world of reality to the world of magic and make believe I was greeted with surprises of all sizes. Arriving for my first day of work I was greeted by the magic of Disney. I soon found out how to make the fairy tale world out of reality as a Walt Disney cast member. As a College Program Intern I was set to work at Disney’s Animal Kingdom® as a host at “It’s Tough To Be a Bug,” 3-D theater show. I began work my first day drawing on the drive Sigma Chi and Bradley built in me to strive for the best. My supervisor noticed my potential and promoted me to another location within the first ten days of working for the company. The promotion took me to the Kilimanjaro Safari  attraction where I piloted a forty-two foot long safari vehicle with forty guests on board through a two week photo safari on the savannas of Africa. While piloting the vehicle I informed our guests about the 30 plus species of animals we had the opportunity to see. The promotion provided me with the opportunity to be noticed. My leader told me that the most important trait I could have was not to be driven but to be patient. He said that to the patient come the best rewards in the end. I thought he was crazy at the time, but he was right. Since starting with the Walt Disney Company last May, I have helped to create magical memories for thousands of guests. And, my hard work has brought me another life changing opportunity. I have been hired as a Guest Service Management Intern, one of seventeen interns chosen from an applicant pool of 575.  As a Guest Service Manager, I am one of five managers overseeing a team of 110 Cast Members who operate Disney Quest at Downtown Disney, an indoor interactive theme park. From here the sky is the limit for my future with the Walt Disney Company. Coming from a small farm town in Northern Illinois to Bradley and now living in the fairy tale world of Disney my life has only begun. As Walt Disney once said, “Never lose site of one thing. It was all started with a mouse.” January 28th, 2010 in Onward | 1 Comment Focusing on Innovation From Justin Saboury ’08, Electrical Engineering major When I arrived at Bradley in 2004, I knew what I wanted to do before I came to orientation. I wanted to design devices physicians and hospitals would use on a daily basis. To do this, I was told, I would have to become involved in two separate fields: engineering and the biological sciences. As luck would have it, Bradley’s core biology courses and upper-level courses on image processing and medical imaging were just what I needed to help get me on the right track. After graduating from Bradley in 2008, I interviewed with companies involved in medical imaging and medical equipment. After speaking to one of my former professors, Dr. John Engdahl, about my options, I learned about a grant Bradley secured from the U.S. Army. Bradley was going to begin working with the University of Illinois College of Medicine to develop biomedical simulation tools to train med school residents. It didn’t take me long until I dropped my other offers and signed up to come on board. The scope of the project is to develop a device which can capture (or record) what a physician is feeling when he palpates-or feels around-a patient’s abdomen. With this information, we know exactly what the doctor was feeling, how hard or soft the region is, and other factors that describe the palpated area.  If we have this info, we can construct a simulator, or “black box” the trainee puts his hand into, and he or she should be able to feel the same thing the professional felt earlier – in a sense, we can “play it back.” Working on this project is both challenging and exciting. I am actually motivated to go to work (which some people tell me is a rare thing) and can’t wait to see what my coworkers and I come up with by the end of the day. I am primarily involved in the electrical design of the recording and playback devices and direct their development. My position requires me to interact with professionals in mechanical and electrical engineering, surgical care, physics, computer science, and even veterinary medicine. These interactions have helped shape my view that when faced with the challenge of innovation, tackling a problem becomes much easier when it can be analyzed from as many angles as possible. Unlike working for a larger company, I am directly involved in all aspects of the project. All of the decision-making is done by our group. It’s nice to be able to hold frequent meetings with all the members, discuss current and potential strategies, and then act on them without having to go through red tape. Our potential success will be a direct outcome of what we put into this project, and that raises the bar and the level of interest for my team and me. What I am doing focuses heavily on innovation. I feel that Bradley’s EE and Biology departments did an excellent job of preparing me to behave like an engineer as well as to think like one and adapt to new challenges faced on the job. I never really feel like I have ever “finished” learning, and this has made the transition feel seamless for me. December 23rd, 2009 in Onward | 1 Comment A career change a little earlier than expected From Andrew McKillip ’09, Industrial Engineering major Amazing how much can change in a year. This time last year I thought after graduation I’d be working as a Senior Transportation Analyst for a manufacturer in the Midwest. Now, I work as a production floor industrial engineer for a defense firm in the southwest. The unstable economy meant tough times for many college grads this year, including myself. Luckily, Bradley was there for me. Last fall, I went through the normal senior routine, applying for many different openings, trying to figure out what life after college was going to look like. As the search was settling down, I decided to stay close to home and took a job locally. However, due to the economic downturn my offer was rescinded, and I had to start the job search again. This time though, I had a starting point. During an on-campus interview, an alum who was recruiting at Bradley told me to stay in touch and contact him, if I wanted a change in my career. This was a little earlier than I had intended to change my career, to say the least, but I sent him an e-mail explaining my situation. A couple e-mails and a few weeks later I was flying to Tucson, Arizona, for an interview. I was a little nervous about the interview. This was the only true ‘engineering’ job I had really applied for and I lacked extensive technical experience. To combat this, during the interview, I focused on the core of the Industrial Engineering curriculum at BU – looking past curing the symptoms and solving the problem. Luckily, everything went well, and I found myself packing to move cross-country. Unfortunately, that move occurred at the height of the Arizona summer – my first day on the job was to be June 30. That meant the day I arrived in Tucson the temperature was 111 degrees. Some may say ‘It’s a dry heat’ but, to me, it was just hot. The first couple of days while I was settling in were intense and I learned pretty quickly to stay out of the sun. As time went on, however, I got acclimated to the weather, and now that it’s in the 70s in December, I’m learning to really like it. While at Bradley I had substantial internship experience, but never was in a traditional engineering environment. I expected to have a rough transition to working on the production floor. What I found was that my education at Bradley truly prepared me for the ‘real world.’ I discovered that I was very much prepared for my job and that my diverse background was quite an asset. My business classes prepared me for what has become a large portion of my job – creating business cases to acquire funding for large projects. My senior project and internship experience prepped me for the professional environment.  The extracurricular opportunities at BU set me up to be a leader within my group. At the core of it all, though, was the problem-solving ability I learned through my Industrial Engineering coursework. That basic framework has allowed me to tackle all sorts of scenarios at work that I could never anticipate. A year ago I thought I’d be battling frigid temperatures and winter weather each morning and working in transportation. Instead, it’s 70 and sunny every day and I work for a top defense firm in an exciting job. Thanks to my BU education, and our network of alumni, something that could have been pretty negative – losing my offer – turned out to be just the opposite. December 17th, 2009 in Onward | 3 Comments Pardon My Dust… From Jason Heinekamp ’09, Civil Engineering major Since I was little I enjoyed playing with blocks and Legos. I would let my creativity fly as I would build everything I could imagine. I loved the fact that I could create something from my own imagination that I could play with for hours and hours. This still holds true today and is one of the many reasons I love the career path I have chosen. In the field of civil engineering and construction, I am able to start with a blank slate and create roads, bridges, and buildings that people use every day. After graduating in May of 2009, I went to work for Cotter Consulting Inc., a small project and construction management firm in the suburbs of Chicago. As a field engineer for Cotter, I’ve spent most of my time working on county bridges and the Illinois Tollway. Specifically, I did survey work, oversaw concrete pours and the placement of structural steel for a bridge in Lisle, Illinois. With the Illinois Tollway, I supervised pavement repairs and the maintenance of highway striping. My schedule during construction season consists of working long hours during the day and at night.  In fact, for the last three months I worked the overnight shift on the Tollway, and spent more than forty hours a week working from a car. A typical work day consisted of me leaving for work at 4:00 in the afternoon, regardless of the weather, fighting rush hour traffic, and arriving on site between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. My field team and I worked with up to thirty laborers and operators each night as we completed 1,500 asphalt patches across 200 miles of interstate highway. All the while, cars and semi-trucks drove within feet of our jobsite in excess of 50 miles per hour. One of my main responsibilities on site was to report our lane closures to the Illinois Tollway and Illinois State Police. These closures were then reported to the media and public. Bradley provided me with the necessary knowledge and skills to begin my first real-world job. After being assigned to my first project, I felt confident that I could perform my new responsibilities adequately as a result of the education I received and the student organizations I was a part of on campus. My classes provided me with knowledge to succeed academically, and also helped me to obtain my first engineering license. Even though I graduated, I will continue to take classes on construction materials and methodology throughout my career. This fall, I had the opportunity to attend the Civil Engineering and Construction Fall Job Fair – again. A year ago, it was here that I met my future employer. This year, I came on Cotter’s behalf as a recruiter. When searching for a full-time job, I learned that it is important to find a job you like and to also find a company that fits you. One of the reasons I chose Cotter was because it was a small, personable company with a promising portfolio. But the most important factor to me was that I felt I would have the opportunity to be a positive influence on my company to help them succeed – a lesson I first learned as a part of the many student organizations I participated in during my four years at Bradley. December 9th, 2009 in Onward | 2 Comments Life has been anything but boring for this dietetics grad From Lisa Esposito ’06, Family and Consumer Science – Dietetics major My life has been anything but boring since graduating from Bradley. In a nutshell, I moved to Houston Texas, completed my dietetic internship, became a registered dietitian (RD) and accepted my first “real person” job, finished graduate school, moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota to start my current job, and became a Board Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics (CSSD). I cannot believe how far I have come and how much I have experienced since graduating in the spring of 2006. I hit the jackpot with my dietetic internship through the University of Houston. My program was only 6 months (the majority are 11-12 months) and I was able to work at various locations throughout Houston and in the Texas Medical Center. Having the opportunity to work under so many experienced RDs, in such different settings, gave me very valuable insight that I have used throughout my career. Adjusting to life in Texas was an experience. Everything really is bigger there, and when they can shape something like the state, they do. My all-time favorite was the Texas-shaped waffle iron. Graduate school was an experience of a lifetime. It was a period of time in my life that tested both my physical and mental stamina. Any person who has completed a thesis can commiserate with me regarding how much time and effort go into it. I have never felt so downtrodden in my life as the day I dropped half of my samples before analyzing them after working in the lab for 18 hours. I thought all was lost and I would never graduate. Fortunately, I had a great advisor and fantastic group of graduate students who helped me get through that moment. One of my favorite moments came on another 18 hour day. While our samples were incubating, the other students in the lab and I decided that we should learn to dance the Hustle, a skill we demonstrated when we were out and about the following weekend. We were the only ones who thought it was funny. My current job title is Sports Dietitian/Research Associate III at the National Institute for Athletic Health & Performance (NIAHP). I play a variety of roles from day to day. I do sports nutrition work with local middle school, high school and college athletes, weekend warriors, and the Sioux Falls Skyforce (NBA D-league basketball team). Along with the nutrition work I do with these athletes, I help complete all of the exercise testing that is done at the NIAHP. When we are not busy with clients, we are working on research. A current project at the Institute involves looking at lower-limb injury risk in high school athletes after repeated bouts of exercise. The NIAHP celebrated its 1st birthday in October and we are continuing to grow and develop in many ways. Bradley provided me with a solid foundation to move forward with my career and not be afraid to take a chance and try something new. I miss the campus and all the folks in the FCS department. I would not be where I am today without them. December 2nd, 2009 in Onward | No Comments Graduate student now is “on the other side” From Sarah Raidbard ’09, English major When I was at Bradley, I was very active in life on campus. My decision to continue as a leader within campus life was largely fueled by the encouragement and counseling of administrators and professors. Through their advice and guidance, I was able to be a successful leader at Bradley. Their mentorship has provided me with the skills necessary to be a leader beyond BU. Now I am on the other side – as the one giving the advice and not taking it. Now I am the one planning the events and not just attending them. I am the role model, instead of the one who follows in footsteps. I am a student’s mentor and not just a learner. Advising student leaders is a large part of my life as a graduate student in Boston. My degree in Higher Education Administration begins in the classrooms of Boston College, but it is not complete without the experience I am gaining as an intern in the Office for Campus Life at Tufts University. The main part of my job is advising student organizations, helping them plan events and reach goals. It is difficult to be an advisor when sometimes I feel as if I could use a little advice myself. For the most part, however, the end result is rewarding. I can tell the students are learning a lot from me, and I am also learning a lot from working with them. One of the biggest lessons I learned is about my place and role as an advisor in the event planning process. There comes a time when an advisor needs to step back and watch the students carry out their plans, even though that may mean letting the students make mistakes. I follow this same lesson in my own life, as I transition from the comfort and familiarity of Bradley to a new, big city. At first, my move to Boston was difficult to bear. It was hard for me to rationalize my decision to move away from everything familiar. I missed my friends and family, and I missed the way I felt when walking across campus at Bradley and knowing everyone I ran into. But the neighborhood I live in is constantly brimming with excitement and buzzing with students. And I am just a short train ride from the beauty and history of downtown Boston. As I finish up my first semester living, working, and studying in Boston, I cannot help but reflect on how much I’ve learned in the classroom and in my internship. But, just as important, is what I’ve learned about myself. I have created a test for myself that has challenged me personally and academically. Although I still have a long way to go before I reach my goals, I have learned a lot about myself and what I am able to achieve. November 25th, 2009 in Onward | 1 Comment From student to teacher, this grad absolutely loves her new career From Elizabeth Bontz ’09, Family and Consumer Science major I wake up every morning, at 6:15, take a shower, eat breakfast, prepare myself for the day, and drive 25 minutes to school as if this has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Well, that’s because it has been, except rather than a student in a school setting, I am now a full time teacher. I teach Family and Consumer Sciences at Elmwood High School, and at 22 years old, I am in some instances only four years older than my students. I made it through Bradley in just four years, something that seems near impossible to accomplish in 2009. Through hard work, and absence of the cliché college life style, I persevered and even graduated with honors. For my student teaching assignment I was placed in the very school I had so desired and requested. Little did I know, I would be hired to teach there the following year. It was a very comforting feeling to walk across the stage at graduation knowing I had a job with a steady income, and better yet, money to begin paying off student loans. Elmwood is a rather small rural community, so I was assigned extra responsibilities as head junior high softball coach and a sophomore class sponsor. I started my coaching responsibilities at the end of July, before the school year had even begun. I was anxious, excited, and honestly could not sleep the night before my first practice. Once the softball season and school year were in full swing, I was extremely stressed and emotional. To put it simply, everyday was overwhelming, yet I was having the time of my life.  It didn’t take me long to realize that I absolutely love my career, and the school that I work in. My day begins at 7:45 when I arrive in my classroom, and I am busy from start to finish. Family and Consumer Sciences is a broad subject to teach, meaning I actually teach 6 different classes. I begin the mornings with a preschool program that pairs my high school students with 3-5 year-old children.  Next I have a Foodservice class that prepares a salad bar in the cafeteria. That is followed by a Fashions class, where my students construct individual projects, such as flannel pants, purses, and blankets. I have two food and nutrition classes in which students learn a great deal about food science and nutrition. But, my main goal for this class is for the students to feel comfortable working in a kitchen.  Lastly, I have a 7th grade class that is introduced to every aspect of FCS. I am amazed at how much interest and energy the 7th grade students bring to each class. My job is so fun, and something I look forward to every day, I think it is still surreal that this is my career. This is what I have to look forward to for the next 30 some years, hopefully. I would like to give hope to those Bradley students that think they will never make it through, or believe that it will be worse after graduation. After all that I had been through in college, with the continual stress, homework, tests, and being broke, I fully believe that life after college is much more fulfilling. Isn’t that why we go to college in the first place? November 18th, 2009 in Onward | 1 Comment No duct tape for this graduate From Mark Bright ’09, Electrical Engineering major As one would imagine, you can’t use duct tape to fix a nuclear power plant – this is where I come in. I am an Instrumentation and Controls Engineer for Sargent & Lundy in downtown Chicago. What we do is consulting, engineering, and design for electric power plants all over the world. Specifically, I create electrical control systems for nuclear power plants. This relates to anything inside of a plant that needs to be monitored, moved, or manipulated by electricity. My summer was spent learning the basic rules and regulations about power plants. My days since then have been spent doing calculations, reviewing schematics, and learning more about this field through company lectures. It is not uncommon some days for me to use my calculator more than my keyboard. I’ve only done a little traveling thus far, but that will change, so I’m catching my breath until then. A few days after moving my tassel, I became a resident of the Wrigleyville neighborhood of Chicago, living two blocks north of the field. Most of the summer revolved around getting to as many Cubs games as possible and celebrating the few times they did win. This is by far one of the best places to live with so many people my age and has several distractions to cure a boring day. Moving into an apartment with my sister is an adjustment I’m still getting used to. But I’m fine with a door-to-desk commute of 20 minutes every day. Outside of work, I explore the city every chance I get and spend time with friends who either work or attend grad school here.  I even had a slight brush with Hollywood this summer when the latest “Meet the Parents” sequel was shot in both my backyard and the CTA train station above it. For a week straight, I was living on my porch watching all the filming. One day I even grabbed an off-screen cameo with Ben Stiller. I’m thankful for the significant influence that Bradley has had on me. Not only do I enjoy working in my field, but I’m in an ideal environment for someone who just graduated college. In many ways I can say that BU played a key role in this. Bradley has a superior reputation in the engineering field and I work with several Bradley alumni throughout my company. November 11th, 2009 in Onward | No Comments A life of service Sarah Johnson graduated in May ’09 with a degree in English. She is teaching in an inner city school in Chicago while working on a degree from Northwestern University. It’s not uncommon for me to hear gunshots in my neighborhood, or to see catfights outside my window.  When I walk outside, I am often stopped by police and asked, “Do you live here?”  The answer is always a vehement, “Yes.” I live on the South Side of Chicago, near the Englewood neighborhood.  It’s not exactly the type of place you would expect a young, successful college graduate to live but I choose to live here, because I choose to live in solidarity with the students I teach. I volunteer for an organization called Inner City teaching Corps, which places young teachers in underserved public and private schools across Chicago.  Though I always knew I wanted to perform some type of service work after I received my degree from Bradley, I wasn’t always sure what I wanted my service work to be.  Early on, I looked into the Peace Corps; however, living alone in a foreign country for two years seemed daunting.  As an English and Secondary Education major, I began looking at programs that exemplified my passion for teaching.  The search for a “perfect” service program led me to the Inner City Teaching Corps where I am currently in the middle of a two-year commitment as a volunteer teacher. Though the main purpose of ICTC is to place young teachers in schools across Chicago, ICTC is really a conglomeration of volunteer teaching, community living, and graduate school all rolled up into a neat little package. My days are jam-packed with obligations and responsibilities I must fulfill to my students, my community members, and my graduate school professors.  Daily, for my students, I must plan lessons that are both informative and engaging, grade papers, call parents, and find ways to cope with the behavioral issues that arise.  As if the responsibilities and demands on a 1st year teacher aren’t hard enough, I must also return home and fulfill my responsibilities to my seven community members. Luckily, my community members have become both best friends and family to me.  As we are all first year teachers, we support each other through the good, the bad, and the ugly.  This makes mundane tasks such as cleaning our bathrooms, cooking dinner, or washing dishes easier to bear at the end of a long day. Finally, I also must make time in my schedule to fulfill requirements for the graduate courses I am taking at Northwestern University.  Weekly, my fellow corps members and I make the commute to Evanston to attend classes. Though my Bradley education prepared me in many ways for this program, I still find myself facing harsh realities daily.  (How do you cope with a 5th grader who can’t read?  Gang members?  Bullying?)  My students may not always love me, but they need me and in many ways, I need them too.  The life of service may not be the path for everyone, but it was the perfect choice for me.
