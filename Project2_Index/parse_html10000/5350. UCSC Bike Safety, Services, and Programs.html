The top reasons for bike accidents on campus are: – Excessive speed on bike path – Using the bike path after dark when it is closed – Ignoring stop signs – Loose sand or gravel on roadway or path – Avoiding unexpected animals (squirrels, snakes, deer) – Pedestrians (weaving in and out of, or avoiding those who cross in front of you) – Vehicles (opening car doors, backing out into your path of travel) – Other cyclist (crowding, merging, weaving) Bike Hazard Report Form The Regional Transportation Commission accepts Bicycle Hazard Report Forms from cyclists or any other commuters who have identified a potential cycling hazard during their travels. These forms are forwarded to the appropriate local jurisdiction for their action. Typically, 50 reports are submitted a year. Report forms may be submitted at any time throughout the year. For additional information on this program or to get a form mailed to you, call (831) 460-3200. Bike Lending Library The UCSC Bike Library offers free use of a bike for a quarter. Applicants must submit a 500 to 700 word essay which says why you need a bike, what will you use the bike for, and how will you contribute to the bike community. Visit the Bike Library website for details. Bike Licensing There are five good reasons to license your bike: 1. It's the law. All bikes operated on the UC Santa Cruz campus and in the city of Santa Cruz must be registered with a current California bicycle license. Unlicensed bikes on campus are subject to citation. 2. It helps prevent theft, and aids in recovering stolen bikes. Send a warning to would–be thieves: This bike is registered with law enforcement agencies. Licensing enters your bike into a statewide system of identification, recovery and notification – and also significantly encreases the likelihood of your stolen bike being found and returned. 3. It's free. TAPS offers free bike licenses and bike license renewals to campus affiliates (students, staff, and faculty) with a valid UCSC ID card. Bike licenses and renewals are valid statewide for up to three years. OPERS does bike licensing for TAPS – see UCSC Recreation Dept. and OPERS Bike Maintenance Clinic information below for more information. 4. It's easy. Bring your bicycle and get it licensed at: UCSC Recreation Department, upstairs at the East Field House, Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (831) 459-2806 OPERS Bike Maintenance Clinic, East Field House Porch, 2:00 p.m. – 5:00 p.m. on Thursdays during academic quarters. (831) 459-2806 The City of Santa Cruz Finance Department, 809 Center St., Monday through Thursday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., (831) 420-5050, cost: $3 5. And in the worst case...bike licenses provide a means of identifying accident victims. Please note: To obtain information about a bicycle that was previously licensed at UCSC contact the Campus Police at (831) 459-2231. Bike Maintenance Bike Maintenance The TAPS Bicycle Program co-sponsors a weekly bicycle maintenance clinic with OPERS to assist UC affiliates with keeping their bikes in safe operating condition. During fall, winter and spring quarter, free drop-in bicycle maintenance is offered on Thursdays at the Recreation Office Porch located at the East Field House, from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Expert bike maintenance specialists are available ath the clinic to assist you with your repairs.

Fixit Stations TAPS has installed Fixit bike repair stations at the following locations: Baskin Engineering (east end of building) Main Entrance Transit Stop McHenry Library Performing Arts parking lot (near bike racks close to Music Center) OPERS (north of building entrance) The Fixit includes all the tools necessary to perform basic repairs and maintenance, from changing a flat to adjusting brakes and derailleurs. The tools and air pump are securely attached to the stand with stainless steel cables and tamper-proof fasteners. Hanging the bike from the hang arms allow the pedals and wheels to spin freely while making adjustments. For help with repairs use the Quick Read (QR) code on the front of the Fixit to view detailed instructions on your smart phone or view the bicycle repair guide online. Bike Parking Campus Map The online map of UCSC has a search feature that displays all locations of bike racks on campus. Bike Lockers 24 “smart” bike lockers are now available at three locations on the main campus: OPERS (north of building entrance) Baskin Engineering (east end of building) Engineering 2 (east end near Baskin Circle) These lockers are operated as part of the Bikelink network, and a fee of $.05 per hour will be collected at the locker. The maximum rental time for any one rental period is ten days. Only a bicycle and its accessories may be stored in the locker.

Regulations Current UCSC code states that bicycles "...shall not be parked, stood, or locked against any lightpost, stair railing, ramp, or any portion thereof, nor shall they block in any way curb cuts, ramps, or paths of accessible travel. Bicycles shall be parked in bicycle racks provided; those parked elsewhere may be impounded." The bicycle owner will be responsible for all costs associated with this action, including the citation, an impound fee, and the cost of removing the bicycle from where it is locked. How To Lock Your Bike There are over 3300 bike rack spaces on campus, and we are adding more each year! Most thefts can be prevented by properly securing the bicycle with an adequate lock to an approved, fixed object. Always lock your bike and lock it to a bike rack. U locks are recommended in combination with a cable or chain to allow you to secure the wheels. A visual guide for bike locking methods is available as a PDF. Bike Programs for UCSC Employees Bike Commuter Shower Program at the East Field House UCSC Faculty and staff who commute to campus by bike may want access to shower facilities after climbing the steep hills around the campus. Bike commuters are eligible to participate in the free Bike Commuter Shower Program; which provides access to the shower facilities at the East House, a short–term locker, and a towel. To receive the Bike Shower Pass, faculty and staff need to apply on-line; showing a valid UCSC Student ID Card gives students the same access. For more information send us an email inquiry. Emergency Ride Home Program TAPS supports transportation alternatives and offers an Emergency Ride Home program for those UCSC staff and faculty who chose to use an alternative to driving alone at least one day a week. Participants are provided a voucher that allows them access to a free cab ride home only for emergency purposes if they used a transportation alternative: bus, bicycle, carpool or vanpool, or walking. Interested UCSC Staff and Faculty can send an email inquiry to find out about eligibility for the ERH program, or stop by the TAPS Sales Office. 0% Interest Bike Loan Commuting by bicycle requires having a good quality bicycle and necessary gear.

Bike Routes to UCSC Choosing a Safe RouteWhen traveling to the campus through the City of Santa Cruz, take time to plan your route to avoid heavily congested areas – especially Mission Street, which serves as a primary route for heavy trucks. The Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission produces a very detailed map of bike routes that is available through TAPS by calling 831/459-2190. A map with suggested bike routes throughout Santa Cruz County (and to UCSC) is available online, as is a PDF showing safe routes to the Westside Bike Shuttle. Bike Skills Classes and Rides at UCSC UCSC offers a number of classes and bike rides though out the year, most of which are low cost or free of charge. If you are a novice and new to cycling or if you are just new to riding your bike in Santa Cruz and navigating the UCSC steep hills, our bike classes will help you feel confident and competent. Our classes are taught by a League Cycling Instructor certified through the League of American Bicyclists and cover topics like essential bike safety equipment and bike checks, avoiding common causes of car-bike collisions, and best routes to take in Santa Cruz. Our bike rides are also lead by a League Cycle Instructor and cover skills in proper lane positioning, emergency bike handling, and navigating the narrow and steep hills of UCSC. Additional topics include skills for riding in the rain, and "secret" lesser-known Santa Cruz City routes and all rides are geared to have fun! Bike Theft Consider bringing an inexpensive bike to campus. They tend to be a less likely target. If your bike is stolen the UCSC Police Department recommends reporting the theft as soon as possible. If your bike was stolen on University Property, report it to the UCSC Police Department immediately by calling (831) 459-2231. Officers are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If your bike was stolen in Santa Cruz City, report it to the Santa Cruz Police Department by calling (831) 471-1131. Have the necessary information needed for the report: bike brand name, model, serial number, value, etc. Keep a lookout for your own bike. Many times people are able to find their own bikes. If you find your bike, call the Police Department immediately. UC Police also suggest several ways to deter theft: Register your bike for free. If your bike is stolen, and it was not registered, the chances of recovering your bike are drastically reduced. Thieves are less likely to steal bikes that are registered because they know the serial numbers have been entered into a national computer database. Bikes can be registered for free at the Recreation Department during regular hours, and at the Drop In Maintenance clinic, Thursdays 2pm-5pm at the East Field House. Lock your bike. Using a high quality U lock is the best style of lock to keep your bike safe. Be sure to lock your bike frame to the rack, and if possible, include locking your wheels to the frame. Do not lock your bike to itself. A visual guide for bike locking methods is available as a PDF.
