Beginning in spring 2015 the rate will be $35 per student, increasing by an additional $35 each semester through fall 2018. In addition, the following administrative changes will be made:   Student tuition and fee payment plans will be expanded to five installments, instead of the current three, and payments will be aligned with financial aid disbursements;  The appointment of two additional students to the University Budget Committee to provide a stronger student voice on matters concerning the university budget, including allocating funds from the Student Success Fee; A Student Success Scholarship Grant program will be implemented to assist students who may be overly burdened financially as a result of the fee.  The goal with the Student Success Fee is to further strengthen the learning environment at California State University, Dominguez Hills, and provide students with a full range of resources necessary to support their academic endeavors and ensure they are not hindered in their progress towards graduation.  Student Success Fee proposal  If CSUDH initiated a Student Success Fee of $280 per student per semester it would generate approximately $7.5 million annually. The funds could support the hiring of academic advisors and faculty, upgrading of classrooms, labs and equipment; in essence, the money would be used to give students the instructional and support services and facilities to help them be successful at CSUDH and beyond. Expenditure of funds would be monitored by a committee of students, faculty, staff and administrators and an annual accountability report would be generated for distribution to the campus, including to the Associated Students Inc., the University Budget Committee, the Academic Senate, etc. Consider these facts: the average net price to attend a public 4-year university nationally is $10,471; the CSU average is $6,519; for CSUDH it is $6,095. This equates to fewer resources for CSUDH students in comparison to what students receive at other institutions of higher education across the country and even within the CSU. CSUDH has the second lowest mandatory campus fees in the CSU which places the campus $591 lower than the CSU average of $1,223. (See Chart for additional details [PDF].)
