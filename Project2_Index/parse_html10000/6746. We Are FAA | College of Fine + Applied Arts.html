Home to creative thinkers in the performing, visual, design, and environmental arts, our college encourages daring collaborations and deeper cultural understanding. Our bold artists, researchers, and educators include Guggenheim Fellows, Doris Duke Award winners, Fulbright Scholars, members of learned societies, decorated educators, and renowned performers. Our dynamic atmosphere motivates us to generate work that pushes boundaries and addresses society's most pressing challenges. It inspires us, and it helps us inspire the world. We see the arts as a way to understand and express the human experience. We are leaders and explorers. We are problem solvers and builders of a bright future. We dream big. Then we make it happen.

A message from the dean We envision the College of Fine and Applied Arts as unsurpassed in its disciplinary depth, creative accomplishment, and cross-disciplinary ingenuity. We are perhaps the world's most comprehensive college of the arts, diverse in our people and programs and unique in our combination of the design, visual, performing, and environmental arts. As part of one of the world's premier research universities, we have unique strength and resources to draw upon in fulfilling our vision. + View the full message from Dean Feser Our Mission The College of Fine and Applied Arts is dedicated to the advancement, practice, and understanding of the arts. The central focus of the college is the synergy between research and the preparation of students for professional careers in the creation and interpretation of the environmental, visual, and performing arts. Deeply related to that focus is the commitment to elevate and sustain the study of the arts as both a necessary mode of understanding and a vibrant expression of human experience within the local, national, and international communities. + See How We Fulfill Our Mission Print College of Fine + Applied Arts University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign   LATEST: World War I Symposium Coming March 10 and 11 LATEST: Learn about Our Summer Programs LATEST: Design and Health Research Consortium Featured LATEST: See Our Work LATEST: William Wegman to Give Talk on March 5 College of Fine + Applied Arts | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
