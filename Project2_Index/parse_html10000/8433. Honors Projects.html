Innovation & Research University of Redlands > Innovation & Research > Student Opportunities & Research > Honors Projects Honors Projects A Redlands degree carries with it a high level of prestige, with employers and graduate admissions officials recognizing that the degree represents hard work, a well-rounded academic foundation and the ability to think critically. Students who want to take their educations a step further often complete honors projects. Students typically begin working during their junior year to develop an extensive independent research project. The project typically takes students most of the senior year, and requires them to do extensive research and reading. Often, students do fieldwork and conduct interviews as part of the research process, while also compiling literature reviews and other information. Students then submit a written report detailing the research project, as well as their findings. Students also are required to participate in a public presentation of their work, as well as an oral examination. Students often use the honors project as an opportunity to explore specific interests and to build a foundation for future employment or graduate-level study. Students have done research in a variety of areas, including gender studies, environmental studies, ethics and international studies. Topics have included: The Influence of Foreign Trade on Morocco’s Language Education Policies Ethnic Banking: Turkish Immigrants in Berlin Reducing Gender Bias Religious Traditions California Governance International Accounting Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: Innovative Teaching Student Opportunities & Research Honors Projects Galapagos Expedition Music Scholarships Research Faculty Honors Spatial Research & Instruction International Opportunities Guidelines, Funding & Grants Policies & Compliance Sponsored Programs and Grants Administration Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories There are more than 1,700 trees on the University of Redlands campus.
