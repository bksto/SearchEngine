For questions about visas and other documentation, contact the Office of International Students and Scholars. Message About Agents and Consultants UCSB does not partner with agents to represent the university or to administer any part of the undergraduate admission application process. The engagement of agents or private organizations for the purpose of recruiting or enrolling international students is not endorsed by UCSB. Agents who may be retained by students to help with the application process are not recognized as representatives of the university and do not have a contractual agreement or partnership to represent UCSB. UCSB expects all applicants to complete their own application materials. The use of agent services is not aligned with UC’s Statement on Integrity, expectations that are explained as a part of applying for admission to the university. UCSB expects an application to be the work of the applicant and that all information on the application is complete, accurate and truthful.
