(Powerpoint) more University of Arizona Veterinary Medical & Surgical Program To Partner with Hermitage No-Kill Cat Shelter Officials for the University of Arizona Veterinary Medical and Surgical Program announced today they will be teaming up with The Hermitage No-Kill Cat Shelter to offer fourth-year veterinary students clinical training in the area of feline medicine. By collaborating with the Hermitage, veterinary students will experience the inner workings of a shelter environment and deal with a range of feline related issues including Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV),  Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV), routine spay/neuter and dental procedures. In addition to their clinical work, students will also learn about shelter operations, compassion fatigue and the No-Kill movement. Read more New Safety Methods Sprout in Fields After E.coli Outbreak The deaths of three people and illness in 200 others because of an E.coli outbreak in California spinach in 2006 shook the fresh produce industry. Since then, farmers in Arizona and California, the two states producing almost all of the nation's leafy greens, have worked to develop new approaches to food safety. Evidence of the work is visible in a romaine lettuce field in Yuma, where 20 workers emerge from the field and take turns washing their hands. Read more A New Way to Visualize the UA's Statewide Impact With three campuses, 160 telemedicine sites and Cooperative Extension offices in every Arizona county, the UA has a wide-ranging impact beyond its main campus in Tucson. A new tool is now available that illustrates the UA's significant presence across the state. The UA Impact Map, viewable at arizona.edu/impact-map, shows the UA’s statewide impact in a variety of areas. For example, it includes data on the number of UA students, alumni and employees in Arizona, as well as the number of degrees awarded throughout the state. Read more UA Leads Effort to Build Mexican Extension As the state's only land-grant institution, the University of Arizona has led outreach efforts through its Cooperative Extension offices across Arizona. Now the UA is assisting efforts to build a similar network south of the border. The UA-led project, announced at Thursday's meeting of the Arizona Board of Regents, is called the Red de Extensión e Innovación Nacional Universitaria, also known as project REINU. The name translates to the National University Extension and Innovation Network. Read more LGBT Teens Who Come Out at School Have Better Self-Esteem, Study Finds Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender adolescents who come out at school have higher self-esteem and lower levels of depression as young adults, compared to LGBT youth who don't disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity at school, according to a new study led by University of Arizona researcher Stephen Russell. Published in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, it is the first-known study to document the benefits of being out during adolescence, despite the fact that teens may experience bullying when they openly identify as LGBT. Read more CALS Dean Calls for 'Decade of Nutrition' Even though the Mediterranean diet is traditionally seated in the sea region around the southern region of Europe, the northernmost tip of Africa and the Middle East, it can be adapted to arid lands — and research indicates an environmental benefit associated with adopting the diet. During the fifth annual Research Frontiers in Nutritional Sciences Conference, recently held at the University of Arizona, researchers and practitioners shared current research about the Mediterranean diet and ways they are advocating for the preservation and broad-based incorporation of the eating pattern. Read more USA Today: Agriculture and Natural Resources among Highest Paying Majors USA Today has compiled a list of the majors likely to have the highest earnings for 2015 graduates, and agricultural and natural resources comes in at number five. Their analysis uses a combination of census data and survey analysis from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). Read more Border Security Efforts Clash with Movement of Wildlife The big border barriers used to curb the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs from Mexico are having detrimental effects on wildlife, environmentalists say. Advocates for a tighter border say security for Americans should trump consideration for animals. The issue manifests itself in Cochise County, where the San Pedro River, which originates in Sonora, Mexico, and flows into Arizona, is a route for wildlife. It's one of the few spots for animals to cross from one country to the next, and the big fence on either side of it is a problem, a Sierra Club official said. Read more Website Shines Light on Renewable Energy Resources University of Arizona researchers and a group of partners have developed a tool that will help utility companies better understand the long-term impact of renewable energy on the power grid and provide insight on how to integrate these resources in the future in the most cost-efficient and reliable way for consumers. The tool — a web portal — gathers, analyzes and displays real-time data from eight Southwestern utility companies, painting a broad picture of energy sources and use across the region. The information will help companies determine what actions to take for backup power planning over the next several years as the percentage of renewable energy usage grows. Read more Center Focuses on Compassion to Improve Ethics, Health Whether coping with physical ailments, contentious home lives or arduous semesters, we all have techniques to offset the hardships in our lives. But can we expand those methods and become better people in the process? Through a generous gift from the Arizona Friends of Tibet, the University of Arizona College of Social and Behavioral Sciences is positioned to explore this question through the newly launched Center for Compassion Studies — the nation's first formalized collegiate center for compassion studies. Read more Curious About the Mediterranean Diet? Here's the Lowdown Beginning this month, the University of Arizona is hosting a series of events — a reception with celebrity chefs, an international conference, a workshop series and a study-abroad opportunity for students — to explore and share current research associated with the Mediterranean diet. "We're showcasing the foods and helping people translate dietary recommendations to actual strategies — taking science to the plate — showing people what you can do, how to do it and where to find it," said Melanie Hingle, UA assistant professor of nutritional sciences and public health. Read more Researchers from 20 Land-Grant Institutions, including the UA, Honored Nationally for Multistate Water Conservation Project The University of Arizona is among 20 land-grant universities recognized with the 2014 Experiment Station Section Excellence in Multistate Research Award from the Experiment Station Committee on Organization and Policy. Researchers participating in project W-2128, “Microirrigation for Sustainable Water Use,” were honored for their efforts at the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities’ annual meeting in fall 2014. Muluneh Yitayew, professor of agricultural and biosystems engineering in the UA College of Agriculture and Life Sciences accepted on behalf of the Arizona portion of the project. Read more Forbes Lobby to Become Hub of Academic Advising, Career Opportunities The lobby of the 100-year-old Forbes building at the University of Arizona is set to become a hub of interactivity for students, advisors, career counselors, faculty and business partners of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. On Dec. 11 the college staged a demolition event that was webcast from the Forbes lobby for the 31 individuals and businesses around the state who donated $1.9 million for this project to “bring the building into the 21st century,” said Shane Burgess, CALS dean and vice president for Veterinary Sciences and Cooperative Extension. Read more UA to Serve Up Fresh Approach to Health The Mediterranean diet has seen growing global popularity as researchers find that the dietary pattern can help prevent or reduce obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Responsive to that popularity, the University of Arizona Department of Nutritional Sciences is hosting a series of events meant to explore and share current research related to the dietary pattern, which focuses on fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and nuts, along with lesser amounts of lean fish, meats, dairy, olive oil and red wine. Read more UA CALS Cooperative Extension Wraps Up Its Centennial Year The year 2014 marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which created the national Cooperative Extension System, a unique partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the nation’s land-grant universities that extends research-based knowledge to youth and adults through a state-by-state network of extension educators. The University of Arizona Cooperative Extension, part of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, celebrated its centennial locally through a year-long series of commemorative events and activities during 2014. Each celebration highlighted Extension’s past while focusing on the application of UA Cooperative Extension’s educational programming into the future. The last two major events took place at the V Bar V Ranch in northern Arizona and at the Phoenix Zoo.  In addition, an exhibit at the UA Science Library on the UA campus will continue until March 11, 2015. Read more CALS 2014 Winter Commencement and Onward This winter, 288 students from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences will be walking in the 2014 UA CALS Winter Commencement, to  be held in Centennial Hall on Saturday, December 20, 2014. Out of these 288 students, 233 are undergraduates and 55 are graduate students. Even though the winter commencement has siginficantly fewer graduating students than its spring counterpart, this class is still widely diverse. The fall 2014 graduating class includes students in at least one of every major offered in the college, ranging from retailing and consumer sciences to agricultural education to microbiology. Read more Saving Food From the Dumpster: The UA's Edible Campus The University of Arizona enjoys a reputation for having a beautiful campus paired with a great setting and ideal weather. At a time in the spring when much of the country is still covered in snow, students can stroll to class in flip-flops, under a grove of citrus trees in fragrant bloom. The fruit these trees produce goes largely unnoticed and unused. While the primary function of these trees — almost 8,000 of them — is to provide beauty and shade, they serve an additional purpose: Many produce food in the form of fruit such as citrus, figs and pomegranates.
