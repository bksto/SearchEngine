More than 200 majors, degrees, and credentials are offered through three colleges, two schools and the Graduate Division. The College of Letters and Science alone offers 80 majors, while the College of Creative Studies offers talented students an alternative approach for pursuing advanced, independent work in the arts, mathematics, or the sciences. The College of Engineering offers degree programs in seven disciplines. As one of only 62 institutions elected to membership in the prestigious Association of American Universities, UC Santa Barbara possesses a renowned faculty that includes six Nobel Laureates and many elected members or fellows of prestigious arts, sciences and engineering academies. Three UCSB professors also have been named MacArthur Fellows by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The campus sits on the edge of the Pacific, in a setting removed from urban pressures and distractions but vibrant with cultural and academic activity, many of the country's most promising students join a community of scholars whose accomplishments are internationally recognized and whose skills as teachers are evident each day in classrooms and laboratories. This is the University of California, Santa Barbara, and there is no other campus quite like it. Learn more in the UCSB Viewbook.
