Why is the Tribal Initiative so important?  We know that American Indian students have some of the lowest college matriculation rates and highest high school dropout rates in the country.  The high school graduation rate among American Indian students remains below 50%, and many of these students drop out even before they reach ninth grade.  At CSUSM, we have made reversing these numbers a priority and, through our purposive efforts that drive the Tribal Initiative, we are making progress, and have exponentially increased our recruitment and retention of students from this traditionally underserved student population. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
