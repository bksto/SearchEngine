Catch all the details (including where to park) here. If you see me, say hi! How hard is it to double major? For example, I’m a sociology major and I also want to major in psychology. It largely depends on the major, and if you’re choosing two majors from different colleges. In this case, sociology and psychology are both within CHASS, and have similar breadth requirements. I would email your current advisor, then head to the psych advisor to obtain their signature on this form and begin the double major process. Are the halls in glen mor co ed? Yes they are. Hi, this is Jennifer. I believe you took my picture yesterday. I was wondering if you use it, could you also link my Instagram? It’s @love_jenn if not that’s totally fine but it would be really cool if you did! 😊 thanks! Love the blog btw I looked at it a lot before I got here and it made me feel really excited about going to ucr! I included the info in the post. Thanks for sharing your style with us!  Have a good weekend and try to stay dry! - Delaynie February 26, 2015 1 note Full Story Raven day in the life ucr uc riverside A Day in the Life: Raven  Editor’s note: We’re excited to bring a popular series back to Life at UCR, affectionately called “A Day in the Life!” We’ll spotlight a day in each of our writer’s lives — ranging from student org meetings to adventures to the C, read on to follow a day in the life of a Highlander! Hey everyone, it’s time to take a walk in my shoes. Here’s a rundown of my typical Tuesday at UCR! 6:30 am My typical Tuesday starts with a loud 6:30 am alarm clock that gets slapped to “snooze” more times than it should. I have Spanish 3 at 8am every day except Tuesday, so my body clock is always ready to roll at 6:30 am. My advice to anyone needing to take language classes is to take them when you’re a lower classmen and take them early in the day. That way, you can finish the courses faster and have the whole day ahead of you. I try to have a well-balanced breakfast, as lunch and dinner can sometimes lose all health-consciousness because of my crazy afternoon schedule. 11 am After breakfast, I take time to review my notes, catch up on any leftover reading from the night before and head to my first class of the day and my favorite class this quarter, Media and Cultural Studies 173, Italian Neorealism.  I love learning about foreign filmmaking and brushing up on my Italian! 11 am is always a busy time for me, as other days I’d be heading to work downtown at ARTSblock at this time. After class, I try my best to head straight back to my apartment, because if not I’ll surely be tempted to buy lunch or a snack on campus. Some days I treat myself with a trip to Scotty’s or a Subway sandwich, but all those trips can add up. To stay on the safe side, I opt to eat lunch at home before my next set of classes for the day.

The weather has been crazy lately here in Southern California, but Mother Nature has nothing on these fashionable Highlanders. I was able to catch these nicely dressed students as the rain paused and sunshine seeped through the clouds for just a moment before the rain came pouring down again yesterday. Students took advantage of the sunshine to show off their own sense of style that they bring onto campus. Jessica Yun || Fifth Year || Economics Major I spotted Jessica coming from Rivera Library with her adorable plaid rain boots, ready for the rain. She has on a nice light thermal high/low long-sleeve shirt that falls over her dark blue jeans tucked into the boots.  Jennifer Tran || First Year || Pre-Business Major Jennifer’s style definitely caught my attention. She wore a black velvet skirt with embossed floral detail. Over her maroon knitted halter-neck crop top is a gray cardigan sweater and to accent her outfit, she wore knee-high tan boots. (Editor’s note: Jennifer hit up our ask box to drop her Insta name, @love_jenn! Thanks for showing us your fashion game.) Raphael Ruiz || Third Year || Economics Major Raphael’s outfit says “hipster” all over it. He has on a loose, long, light gray shirt, and contrasts it with a dark gray hooded jacket. Maroon pants and gray shoes bring his whole outfit together. Get more UCR street style inspiration after the break!

Hi! Language requirements vary by academic college and major. You can place out of language instruction, but you may still have to take classes in that language. I would register for the test, then email your advisor. Are the foreign language placement tests held on campus or are there off-campus test locations? They’re conveniently located on campus. When submitting a campus apartment request, how does it work? I know you can have a first through third choice but how do you actually pick your apartment? Do they tell you which one of you choices are open and you get to pick which one you want to stay in when it’s time to sign the contract? I’m having trouble deciding where I want to go and I don’t want to commit just yet. You’re given your apartment assignment based on what’s full and your 1-3 preferences. Before you sign your contract, you’ll receive all the details of which unit you’re in and its floor plan. You don’t have to know yet, just keep in mind that it runs on a first-come, first-serve basis, so if you’re hoping for one of the more popular apartments I would act slightly more quickly. Best of luck! Who can apply for ASUCR? Can Freshmen apply? is it really competitive? Anyone in good standing with the University can apply, as long as they aren’t graduating in June! Elections are competitive, with candidates working hard to earn their votes. Usually the results are within a few hundred votes of each other. However, don’t let this discourage you! If you’re motivated, you can do it.  - Delaynie Making Your Voice Heard February 17, 2015 2 notes Full Story ucr asucr student government ucsa University of California delaynie As fabulous as UCR is, every campus could use some minor improvements. Whether you hate how expensive parking is, want more resources as a commuter, or have an idea for a new campaign, UCR values your thoughts. Whatever issue you want to tackle, there’s one surefire way to begin solving it: by getting involved in student government.  I know, I know. It sounds a little boring, right? Wait, don’t click out. I know from experience that nothing holds a college student’s attention more than a fun quiz (looking at you, Buzzfeed.) ASUCR is doing big things, and the choices we’re making directly affect you. We could use your unique voice and perspective to make awesome changes. Take this fun quiz to find your hidden student government talents: 1. You’re planning a bomb grad party for your roommate before she abandons you for the real world. Which part of the planning do you sign up to handle? A. Talking to the neighbors and your apartment security to avoid a noise violation, then handling people’s questions via text and email. People have to know if you’re a Pepsi or Coke household. B. Making the perfect playlist, building a photobooth, and going wild with the streamers. I’m thinking #tartanturnup as the signature hashtag? C. Creating the guestlist: gotta have the right balance of fun personalities, cherished high school friends, and requisite oddball family members. 2. Which on-campus events do you NEVER miss? A. The guest lecturers with inspiring life stories. Bring on the motivational soundtrack! B. The Food Truck Festival, Heat, Spring Splash…which events do I miss? (None. The answer is none.) C. The awesome Career Center networking events. A chance to wear my swaggiest suit, plus a future job? Sign me up. 3. Which Instagram account is your favorite? A. @CharityWater. An amazing charity with real-time photos of people saving the lives of strangers definitely gets your double tap.  B. @Insomniac_Events. The large-scale festivals they throw (EDC, anyone?) give you serious good vibes for all your own event planning.  C. @CNN. The news just got even more appealing w/ high-res photos. 4. Quick! Pick a new club to join. A. ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism)  B. Wishmakers: We raise funds and awareness to enable Make-A-Wish to grant wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions. C. Lean In: to increase gender equality, especially in the workplace. 4. Do you enjoy debating? A. Yeah! I like making sure everyone’s voice is equally heard.  B. I don’t mind, but I would rather create a plan of action afterwards.  C. I love debating! Why, wanna talk about it? Which ice cream flavor best describes your personality? Editor’s Note: this question may be completely unrelated to student government, but I wanted to give everyone a chance to ponder ice cream for a moment. A. Cherry Garcia, because I can appreciate a Grateful Dead shoutout coupled with some rockin’ fruity ice cream. B. Rainbow sherbet, because the wild neon colors make my ice cream binge feel more like a party and less like procrastination from studying. C. Tart fro-yo, because I enjoy #gains while still losing control with the gummy bear toppings.  Find out your results after the break!

However, I’m interested in having a 2 Bed/ 1 Bath double-occupancy room and I don’t have anyone else to share the room with. Does UCR do random roommate assignments like they did in the dorms, or do we need to find our own roommate? Thanks! You can definitely mix it up and get a random roommate! #nonewfriends remix  Hey, I’ve been admitted to UCR and I’ve been thinking about participating in the concert band. I looked at the music dept’s site and it says for the concert band, you need to have taken band for four years during high school but I couldn’t take band this year for scheduling reasons. If anyone knows if I can still get in, that’d be great! Hi! I emailed the head of the Concert Band, and it turns out he’s pretty wonderful and friendly! He said to email him at samuel.andress@ucr.edu and he’ll work things out with you. Hi! I really want to get involved with the school newspaper. I heard the meetings are every Monday. Do you know what time they are, and how long they last? Also, am I allowed to show up to a meeting in the middle of the quarter, or does it have to be the first one of the quarter? Thanks! Hello! Highlander meetings are at 5:15, except for holidays (this Monday, woohoo!) They’re most likely quick, no more than an hour. You can definitely show up!  I hope your three day weekend is phenomenal and filled with on-sale Valentine’s candy. I know mine will be.  Valentine’s Day in the IE February 12, 2015 10 notes Full Story kayden valentines day galentines day Love is in the air and Valentine’s day is just around the corner for all you romantics out there. Luckily, it falls on a weekend! If you’re planning to stay in the area, there’s still plenty to do nearby, whether it’s with a significant other or with friends that you love oh-so-much. Even if you don’t celebrate Valentine’s day or despise it, these are still great date ideas for future reference! You could always celebrate Galentine’s Day a la Leslie Knope. Here are some options:  Drive-in Theatre: Source This is a classic old-school date. All you need is you, your date, and a car (and popcorn). There are 3 screens that show different movies on each. What better way to watch the new movie 50 Shades of Grey? There are two locations: Rubidoux and Van Buren, both here in Riverside. Downtown Riverside/Mission Inn: Source There’s arguably nothing more romantic than a stroll through historic Downtown Riverside and the Mission Inn. You can also book carriage rides for a small price. There are even more fun and romantic shenanigans to be had after the break!

Having something to look forward to during the week always makes school just a bit more bearable. And there’s always, ALWAYS something to do on campus!

You made it through week 5 (using the phrase “made it” incredibly loosely). Will you guys post the Heat line up as soon as you know it? Also do you think it should/will be twice as great since it was cancelled (with really short notice btw) last year?? I have legitimately been waiting to use that gif since I started editing this blog. This is quite a moment for me. Anyways, Heat is planned by the HUB. I’m just a student like you, and I’m not too proud to admit I threw a large-scale tantrum when I got the fateful text that Heat was cancelled. My roommate says she knew by the rage filling my first shriek that it was tragic news. BUT! Good news has come to us, in the form of this:  Chance the Rapper, Panic at the Disco, 3LAU, Smallpools, Giraffage. I’m pretty pumped and I hope you are too! :) When is the deadline to submit a UCR On Campus Apartment housing contract? "UCR Campus Apartment applications are accepted on a year-round basis." That’s the official answer, but from my friends’ experiences, I would settle it by May at the latest. They fill up really quickly! I got accepted into UCR earlier this month, and though I haven’t made a final decision on which college I want to attend, I’m still interested in learning more info about housing. If I am unsure about attending UCR but know I would want on-campus housing do I still apply for a housing application? And if I have friends that have recently been admitted to UCR as well can I request to dorm with them? Congratulations on your acceptance! You can only apply for Housing once you’ve submitted your SIR, or your formal decision to attend UCR. You can request roommates when you apply for housing, and also at orientation. Good luck deciding, and I hope to see you here! Hi, is there (a) certain week(s) fall 2015 orientation is supposed to take place? Love the blog! Hi, thank you! We love ya right back. Orientation for students coming to UCR Fall of 2015 will take place throughout July and August. The full schedule is here. Welcome to UCR!  So I’ve been invited into the Honors College at UCR, and I was just wondering if you believe that it is a worthy investment into my education. I’ve looked at the website, but it seems out of context without some type of student input like that of yourselves. I was accepted into CNAS for Bio if that helps to add more context. Congratulations! You should be proud of yourself. I only know people in the CHASS Honors Program, but they absolutely view it as a worthy investment. You will have more access to professors, and your discussions are held with the professor instead of a TA. You can engage in research beginning earlier in your career at UCR, and there are support programs to make sure you’re successful. It’s a great motivation to be surrounded by other high-achieving students within your college, and I, personally, would recommend going for it.  When will the starbucks at glen mor open? Like the actually date? They said after winter break, but it’s still not open! They’re still quoting “winter”, so hopefully that means within the enxt 5 weeks! Saving Money in College February 05, 2015 14 notes Full Story tips saving money broke college students josh Let’s get into some real talk, Highlanders. I am what I like to call“money-conscious”, but my friends like to call me cheap. There are few things that give me as much of a rush as finding a good deal (those things are the fight for Coachella tickets and sneaking snacks into movie theaters, in case you were wondering). So the fact that many establishments offer student discounts brings me joy to no end, and we here at Life at UCR thought it would be a great idea to compile these establishments for you so you have a little bit more cash to spend on Thin Mints from those adorable wagon-heaving Girl Scouts. How can something so darling take so much of my money? Source. Locals Only Riverside, being the lively college town that it is, has a lot of establishments within city limits that offer discounts to UCR students, first of which being sweetFrog Premium Frozen Yogurt over in the Canyon Crest Towne Center. What’s cool about sweetFrog is that they offer a student discount of 10% every day of the week, but on Highlander Tuesdays they offer a special 15% discount for UCR students. Truth be told, if I could get cake batter froyo IV’d directly into my veins I would, and doing so at 15% off would be all the better. Staying on the topic of food, Rising Savor is next on our list. This small Chinese food establishment on Chicago Ave. & University Ave. (a few doors down from Food 4 Less) is already catered to a college budget: daily combo meals start as low as $4.99 and it’s only one dollar sign on Yelp (my only requirement for eating out, to be quite honest). In addition to the already low prices Rising Savor offers, there’s a daily 10% discount for students. That’s a discount on something that’s already rated one dollar sign. Does that make it only half a dollar sign? I’ll write a letter to Yelp. These next two discounts have been provided to you by the hard working staff and student leaders here at UCR. The first is through the Riverside Transit Agency, the transit authority serving a majority of the Riverside County region. With a swipe of your R’Card you get unlimited free rides on all fixed-route RTA buses. Need to get Murrieta and don’t have a car? Take the RTA! Have no business being in Murietta? Who cares! IT’S FREE. Source. This next one is more of a recent offer. If you’re tired of fighting Hunger Games-style for a computer at Watkins on Finals Week (pro tip: the Stats Computer Lab is where it’s at), all because you don’t want drop $140 on the Microsoft Office suite, your prayers have been answered. UCR is now offering students access to Microsoft Office 365 Pro Plus, which works as online versions of programs such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Not only can you access these programs COMPLETELY FOR FREE from the comfort of your own computer, you’ll also be given 1 terabyte of online storage. I can’t even imagine how much storage that is. Like, I’m literally unsure about how much a terabyte is but it sounds like more than I need. World-wide Savings As cute and quaint as it is that local business in the Riv offer student discounts, there are some international retailers that are also understanding about how rough it is live off protein shakes.
