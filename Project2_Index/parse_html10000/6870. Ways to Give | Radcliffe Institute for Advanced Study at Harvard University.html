Radcliffe College 50th reunion classes recently have chosen to support the Schlesinger Library and have enabled the digitization of the Radcliffe College Archives, including yearbooks and special collections.

Planned gifts can: Provide a predictable income for life for you and/or others Generate a charitable tax deduction for a portion of your gift Avoid upfront capital gains taxes and save on gift/estate taxes Benefit from the expert investment management performance of Harvard Management Company at no cost to you Provide a much larger gift to the Radcliffe Institute than you might have thought possible What are some examples of planned gifts? Life income gifts include charitable gift annuities, charitable remainder trusts, and pooled income funds. In many cases, life income gifts can increase income (a portion of which is tax free), reduce income taxes, and avoid capital gains taxes. Gifts of real estate can allow you to leverage a significant asset for your benefit and the University's. While supporting Harvard's mission, you can save on taxes, increase your income, and/or reduce the burden of maintaining or selling your property. Gifts can be made with residential, commercial, or undeveloped real estate. Bequests can be made through a will, trust, retirement assets such as an IRA, or life insurance. Many alumnae/i and friends find that a bequest is the easiest way to make a generous gift. Whatever estate plan you choose, notify the Institute so that we can recognize your generosity with membership in the Ann Radcliffe Society. The Radcliffe Institute partners with the Harvard University Office of Planned Giving in facilitating planned gifts. Please review their website, which has extensive information—including a series of questions and answers and explanations of the various types of gifts. Would you like to speak to someone at the Radcliffe Institute about planned giving? Please contact Lucy Kim, at (617) 496-3150 or lucy_kim@radcliffe.harvard.edu.   Endowed Gifts If you are interested in making a major gift to the Radcliffe Institute, you may want to consider creating an endowed fund. Endowed funds, which must be a minimum of $100,000, can provide support in perpetuity for a particular area of interest or ongoing support for the Fellowship Program, the Schlesinger Library, and Academic Ventures. Donors can endow a named fellowship, Schlesinger Library fund, or Academic Ventures fund. The Radcliffe Institute offers a matching program that provides a 50 percent match for endowment gifts of $250,000 or more. The minimum for the match is reduced to $100,000 for 25th reunion classes and younger. For example, a donor celebrating her 30th reunion and making a gift of $2,000,000 will receive $1,000,000 in matching funds for a total value of $3,000,000. This donor would receive $3,000,000 credit in The Radcliffe Campaign and The Harvard Campaign, along with her 30th reunion gift campaign of the Harvard College Fund. If you would like to find out more about creating an endowed fund and taking advantage of our special matching opportunities, please contact Cristina Aspuru at (617) 496-4166 or cristina_aspuru@radcliffe.harvard.edu.   Leverage Your Gift Harvard College Fund Credit Your gift to the Radcliffe Institute also qualifies for full Harvard College Fund class credit. However, if you prefer not to receive credit for the Harvard College Fund, please inform us when making your gift.   Employer Matching Gift Program If your or your spouse's employer has a matching gift program, you will be recognized for the full amount of your own gift plus the resulting corporate match. Find out if your employer will match your gift using the Matching Gift Program Search. Your employer's benefits or human resources office can provide information on how they process matching requests. According to University policy, matching gifts will be credited to the same fund as the donor's original gift, unless the donor requests otherwise or the policies of the company prohibit matching gifts to particular funds. Questions about matching gifts? Please contact Cristina Aspuru at (617) 496-4166 or cristina_aspuru@radcliffe.harvard.edu.   Radcliffe Endowment Match Donors wishing to create an endowed fund at the Institute may be eligible for at least a 1:2 match with a minimum gift of $250,000. The minimum for the match is reduced to $100,000 for 25th reunion classes and younger. You will receive credit for your donation plus the match at both the Radcliffe Institute and Harvard University.   Legacy Pledge Classes in their 50th reunion year and beyond now have the option to create a legacy pledge at the Radcliffe Institute. When you make a minimum commitment of $50,000 and pay the first 20 percent of the gift within three years of the pledge, you can fund the balance of the pledge from your estate. You will receive credit for the full amount of your pledge during your reunion year. For more information about leveraging your giving, please contact Lucy Kim, at (617) 496-3150 or lucy_kim@radcliffe.harvard.edu.   Donor Recognition Every individual who makes a gift to the Radcliffe Institute automatically joins one of our donor groups.
