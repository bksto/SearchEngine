The race, which will begin at 9 a.m. on the east side of the main quad, will be a celebration of bravery, enthusiasm and compassion. Participants are encouraged to wear capes, masks and other superhero regalia while they enjoy a run through central campus past the quad, the ARC, the Arboretum, and the Welcome Center. At 9:45 a.m. mighty heroes, ages 5 and younger, will have the opportunity to chase a villainous gorilla in a 400-meter dash around the UC Davis quad. After both races, runners will get to enjoy the congratulatory Valhalla Gala, with food, games, music, and prizes. “It’s a fun day, a good cause, and a chance to dress up, which I think is a good idea anytime!” said Ellen Davis ’16 who will be rocking a We Are Aggie Pride cape for the Heroes Run and be the lead cyclist for the 5K run. Hero participants, in addition to demonstrating athletic prowess, will also have the chance to truly live the super hero mantra of helping those in need. All proceeds of fun run, which is being hosted by UC Davis Conference and Event Services office, will benefit We Are Aggie Pride—a student-run philanthropy group that provides emergency aid to students for food, rent, and other necessities. Registration is available online now until race day. General registration is $40, students age 5 and up are $25, the 400-meter villain chase is $10, and UC Davis students, staff, and faculty get in for a discounted ticket price of $15. You may also donate directly to We Are Aggie Pride, the student helping students fund. “Help a student,” said Davis, community events director for WAAP, “and be a hero.” Read more.
