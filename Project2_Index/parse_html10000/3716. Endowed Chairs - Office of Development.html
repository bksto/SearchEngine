Ways to Give Other Links Points of Pride DevNet Office of Development ENDOWED CHAIRS Joseph Incandela is the first holder of the Pat and Joe Yzurdiaga Chair in Experimental Science. At UC Santa Barbara, private philanthropic support is central to maintaining the quality of teaching, research, and public service. One of the most important types of gifts to higher education is an endowed chair, for an endowed chair ensures faculty excellence. Created by a philanthropic gift, these highly prized academic positions are supported by earnings from invested funds. While the state budget pays for the faculty member's salary, the proceeds from the endowment provide enrichments—such as research money and support for instruction—that are important to the recruitment and retention of the world's greatest scholars.
