Application Deadlines for F-1 Students May 15th for those applying for the Fall Semester, which begins in August. October 15th for those applying for the Spring Semester, which begins in mid-January. Note: The Graduate School does not apply hard deadlines but instead operates on a "rolling admission" basis. This means the Graduate School will process all applications as received until it is impossible to finalize admission for the student in a given semester. Those applications received too late for a given semester will be processed for the next available semester and the applicant will be notified. NOTE: In order to process an application, we must receive all supporting documents on the "Check-off lists". © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
