Living on campus is more than just a place to eat and sleep. Students who live on campus are within walking distance to classes and resources such as the library, computer labs, the health center, bookstore and recreational and athletic facilities. On-campus living also provides students with numerous opportunities to meet new people and establish friendships that can last a lifetime. Where you live as a university student directly impacts the quality of your educational experience, and national statistics show that students who live on campus do better academically.
