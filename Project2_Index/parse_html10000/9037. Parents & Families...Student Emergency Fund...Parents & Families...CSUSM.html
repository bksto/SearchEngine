In 2012, The Student Emergency Fund was established through the Senior Class Gift Campaign and matching gifts from generous donors. The fund was created to provide compassionate assistance to students who encounter unforeseen financial emergencies or catastrophic events that hamper their progress towards a degree. The fund, managed by CSUSM’s Associated Students, Inc., helps struggling students in their time of need. Students have received emergency funds to help with medical expenses, gas, food and shelter. With donor support, CSUSM seeks to assist 100 needy students annually through the fund. To give to the fund, please go to the CSUSM Giving Page, select the option Student Affairs from the "gift to support" drop down menu, and enter "Student Emergency Fund" in the Other Designation. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
