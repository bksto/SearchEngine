They are invited to add to campus traditions, create new student organizations and activities, and offer ideas on student services, planning priorities and university growth and development. Students can gain valuable skills through internships and service learning, expand their cultural and international awareness and understanding, develop leadership potential and make lifelong friends through involvement in a variety of academic, student and recreation programs. Student government, intercultural and residential programs, intramurals, club sports and athletic teams, university events and a variety of clubs and organizations are among their many choices. Students also have access to a wide array of support services as well as academic, social, recreational and wellness activities. In the neighboring city of Merced, students will find a small, vibrant community. Currently home to more than 80,000 residents, the city retains the charm of a small town—with short commute times—and many of the amenities of a larger community. Many educational, cultural and co-curricular activities connect students with the city of Merced and the surrounding region, and students are encouraged to experience the warmth of UC Merced’s host community and discover its treasures. Wandering through the pedestrian-friendly downtown is a good place to start. Brick paved walking areas, alleys decorated with murals and Italian trellises, an award-winning multicultural arts center, a community playhouse, the newly restored Merced Theater, and several historically significant buildings are among the features. Merced also is home to shops, restaurants, farmers markets and retail stores, with additional choices available in the nearby cities of Modesto and Fresno.   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
