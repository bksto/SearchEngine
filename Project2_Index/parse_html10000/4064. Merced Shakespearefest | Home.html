See Free Shakespeare in Applegate Park!   Thanks to those who came to see The Winter's Tale We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did!     Coming up next: Henry V in Applegate Park, September 2015   See details and  information HERE! Our summer Shakespeare festival is fun for the whole family and it is free of charge. It happens during daylight hours in the beautiful green Applegate Park in Merced, California. We offer a quality, fast-paced performance with a minimal set in an abridged version, usually 90 minutes long. Local performers are cast in open auditions two to three months before each show. Starting in 2010, we also offer a somewhat longer indoor production early each year.     Merced Shakespearefest is a: Non-profit organization with 501(c)3 status Member of American Association of Community Theatre
