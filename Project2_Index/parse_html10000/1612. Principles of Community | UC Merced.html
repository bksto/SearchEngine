These principles reflect our ongoing efforts to increase access and inclusion and to create a community that nurtures lifelong learning and growth for all of its members. We encourage every member of the UC Merced community to join us in our collective pursuit of these principles:   We recognize and celebrate the identities, values and beliefs of our community. We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person while cultivating a campus climate rooted in mutual respect and compassion. We uphold the right to freedom of expression and encourage a culture of dialogue, understanding, and civility in all interactions. We seek to create a campus where a rich tapestry of ideas is shared, collaboration is embraced, and innovation is promoted. We pursue excellence in teaching and learning through contributions from all community members fostering a culture of open exchange. We promote opportunities for active participation and leadership in our communities. We champion civic engagement, environmental stewardship, research and teaching that connect theory and practice to learning and doing. We take pride in building, sustaining and sharing a culture that is founded on these principles of unity and respect.   The UC Merced Principles of Community were developed by the Chancellor’s Advisory Council for Campus Climate, Culture and Inclusion in collaboration with the campus community. These principles were issued on March 25, 2014.
