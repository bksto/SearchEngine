Introduction These procedures have been implemented to address complaints of discrimination on the basis of age and/or disability in any activity, policy, rule, standard, or method of administration that is related to the operation of University’s programs. II. Eligibility These procedures may be used by any member of the public who alleges age (Under the Age Discrimination Act) or disability (Under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act) discrimination on the basis of class. However, anyone who wishes to challenge a decision made about them by an agent of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in the course of their employment or enrollment at UIC must utilize the UIC Academic Grievance Procedures. III. Definitions A. Grievance: A written statement submitted by a Grievant identifying the activity, policy, rule, standard or method of administration he/she claims to be discriminatory on the basis of age and/or disability and explaining the manner in which that activity, policy, rule, standard or method of administration discriminates. All Grievances must be signed by the Grievant and must outline the Grievant’s allegations in as much detail as possible. B. Grievant: Any member of the public who submits a Grievance. C. Grievance Officer: The assigned investigator of the UIC Office for Access and Equity can be contacted at the address below: Office for Access and Equity (MC 602) 809 South Marshfield Avenue, Room 718 Chicago, IL 60612-7207 (312) 996-8670 Fax (312) 413-0055 http://www.uic.edu/depts/oae D. Appeals Officer: The Associate Chancellor for Access and Equity or his/her designee.. E. Days: Any reference to “days” herein shall refer to business days (excluding weekends and federal holidays).

The Record will be maintained for at least five (5) years following the final decision. IV. Grievance Process Filing of the Grievance: The Grievant must file his/her Grievance with the Grievance Officer no later than ten (10) days after he/she becomes aware of the offending activity, policy, standard or method of administration. Investigation: The Grievance Officer shall conduct an appropriate investigation of the issues raised in the Grievance. The Grievant shall be given an opportunity to submit any relevant evidence he/she may have to support the Grievance. Within fourteen days (14) of submission of the Grievance, the Grievance Officer shall issue his/her findings. In the event the Grievance Officer finds evidence of discrimination in the activity, policy, standard or method of administration, he/she shall make recommendations for change(s) and shall coordinate the efforts for change(s) with the department/unit/college whose activity, policy, standard or method of administration is at issue. Furthermore, in the event that the individual was adversely affected by a decision made pursuant to a discriminatory process, policy, activity, standard or method of administration, the individual will be given the opportunity for the decision to be reconsidered according to the revised process, policy, etc. In those cases where the Grievance Officer finds no evidence of discrimination, he/she shall send written notice of that finding to the Grievant within that 14-day time period. Said notice shall inform the Grievant of his/her right to appeal the finding to the Appeals Officer within five (5) days of receipt of the notice. Appeal: An appeal of the Grievance Officer’s findings must be in writing and must state the basis for the appeal, providing any additional evidence or information that may support the Grievant’s claim of discrimination. The Appeals Officer shall review the Grievance Officer’s record and any information/evidence submitted with the Appeal and shall issue findings within ten (10) days of receipt of the appeal. In the event the Appeals Officer finds evidence of discrimination in the activity, policy, standard or method of administration, he/she shall make recommendations for changes. In those cases where the Appeals Officer finds no evidence of discrimination, he/she shall send written notice of that finding to the Grievant within that 10-day time period. There shall be no further levels of review or appeal beyond the Appeals Officer. Deviation from the Process: Upon proof of extenuating circumstances, the Chancellor and only the Chancellor may approve a deviation from these procedures (e.g., extension of a deadline).
