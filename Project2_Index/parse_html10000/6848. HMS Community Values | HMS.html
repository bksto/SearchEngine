HMS is a community of communities in which each member plays a vital role. By articulating our community values we will further define the strategies that fulfill our mission and guide our interactions with each other. The extraordinary work that you do as a member of our community matters, and this initiative is an opportunity to articulate our shared values and reflect upon how we engage on a daily basis “to create and nurture a diverse community of the best people committed to leadership in alleviating human suffering caused by disease.” We know that many groups within our larger community have engaged in similar efforts in recent years. HMS’ initiative is in no way intended to supplant those excellent efforts, but rather to learn from them, using them to identify and integrate common beliefs and themes. Once we develop a statement of values, I am hopeful that these principles will be incorporated into the daily life of our community and that they will help cultivate a deeper sense of unity and collaboration. Everyone will have the opportunity to participate in this process. We are currently establishing a committee made up of students, staff and faculty. This community values committee will seek input from the broader HMS community through a variety of means, which you will be hearing about more in the days to come. Your ideas will inform the values statement and guide us on how best to champion it. I am hopeful you will want to be a part of this meaningful initiative. If you are interested in participating, or if you have ideas to suggest, please contact the project team at communityvalues@hms.harvard.edu. I look forward to working with you and to your contributions to this exciting and important initiative. Sincerely, John John Czajkowski Executive Dean for Administration Harvard Medical School The World Is Waiting: The Campaign for Harvard Medicine About the HMS Community Values Initiative The community values initiative is designed to engage the HMS community in the development of shared values that embody how our community works together in pursuit of our institutional mission. The HMS community values statement will articulate how we work and interact with each other, and what it means to be a member of the HMS community. What we do here at HMS matters, and this initiative is an opportunity for us as a community to reflect not just on what we do, but on how we do it.  We are on the cusp of life-changing breakthroughs that can improve the health of people everywhere. Helping people live longer, healthier lives is more than a goal; it’s our responsibility. We operate like no other institution. We are the very heart of medicine, with more research benches and bedsides within a 5-mile radius than anywhere else in the world. We are constantly driving vital resources, diverse thinking, and leadership into the whole body of science and medicine. We not only work toward our goals but do so with certain core values and principles.   Outcomes The community values statement will be incorporated into employee and faculty orientation and training and will be communicated throughout HMS as a reminder of the commitment and expectations we hold for all members of our community. We will integrate these values into our daily work lives, so that they may serve as a useful guide to inform our priorities, decision making and actions. The values statement is intended to present organizational norms and expectations and to augment the HMS mission statement by defining our shared commitment to the HMS community. Get Involved! We are forming a community values committee made up of faculty, staff and students. It will be led by Peter Howley, the HMS Shattuck Professor of Pathological Anatomy, and Jennifer Puccetti, Director of Administration, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine. It is our goal to invite all members of our community to partake in this process through a variety of forums. Help us articulate HMS' core values and principles.  If you are interested in participating in this exciting opportunity or if you have ideas regarding this initiative, please contact the project team at communityvalues@hms.harvard.edu. Harvard University Values Statement Harvard University aspires to provide education and scholarship of the highest quality — to advance the frontiers of knowledge and to prepare individuals for life, work, and leadership. Achieving these aims depends on the efforts of thousands of faculty, students, and staff across the University. Some of us make our contribution by engaging directly in teaching, learning, and research, others of us, by supporting and enabling those core activities in essential ways. Whatever our individual roles, and wherever we work within Harvard, we owe it to one another to uphold certain basic values of the community. These include: Respect for the rights, differences, and dignity of others Honesty and integrity in all dealings Conscientious pursuit of excellence in one’s work Accountability for actions and conduct in the workplace The more we embrace these values in our daily lives, the more we create and sustain an environment of trust, cooperation, lively inquiry, and mutual understanding — and advance a commitment to education and scholarship, which all of us share.
