Biography       Dr. Roger Bales, Founding Professor of Engineering at UC Merced,, has been active in water- and climate-related research for over 30 years. His degrees include a B.S. in Civil Engineering (Purdue), M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering (UC Berkeley), M.S. in Social Science/Economics (Caltech) and Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering Science (Caltech). Dr. Bales� scholarship includes over 140 papers in peer-reviewed journals, and many more presentations, reports and book chapters. He is a fellow in the American Geophysical Union, the American Meteorological Society, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has published well-cited papers in multiple disciplines, including hydrology, glaciology, paleoclimate, atmospheric chemistry, geochemistry and environmental engineering. His current work is contributing to California�s efforts to both build the knowledge base and implement policies that adapt our water supplies, critical ecosystems and economy to the impacts of climate warming. He works with leaders in state agencies, elected officials, federal land managers, water leaders, non-governmental organizations, and other decisionmakers on developing climate solutions for California. He has led several multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary research programs, at UC Merced since 2003, and prior to that at the University of Arizona.
