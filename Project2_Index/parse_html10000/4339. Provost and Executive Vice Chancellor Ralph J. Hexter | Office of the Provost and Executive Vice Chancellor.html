In addition, he is the University’s Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and serves as the Chancellor’s principal liaison to the Academic Senate. The Provost also serves as liaison between the central administration and the broader campus community, frequently meeting with a wide variety of campus units and groups to convey important information and foster dialogue.
