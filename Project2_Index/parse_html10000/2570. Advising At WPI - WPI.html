Under the WPI Plan, students have the final responsibility for designing their own educational experience at WPI which includes understanding all their degree requirements and making sure all those requirements have been satisfied for graduation. The role of the faculty advisor is to help his/her advisees design a program of study which reflects the students’ interests and professional goals. The Office of Academic Advising provides supplemental support to students to help them create academic plans and reach their goals. The Office also oversees the Academic Resources Center, which is the home of MASH, tutoring, and the Peer Academic Coaching Program. Lastly, the Insight Program and Pre-Professional Programs (Pre-Health, Pre-Law, and Teacher Preparation) are coordinated through the Office of Academic Advising. As you plan your classes for next year, you are encouraged to utilize the WPI Scheduler and our student resources. Events RSS Feed Currently there are no upcoming events.
