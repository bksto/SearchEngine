The fee, which varies by section and is indicated in the course listings, is assessed to students enrolled in these courses at the end of the 5th week of instruction. Students who drop the course(s) after that date are not entitled to a refund of the CMF. At this time, certain courses in Bioengineering, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Earth and Planetary Science, Electrical Engineering, ESPM, Integrative Biology, Journalism, Molecular and Cell Biology, Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, Physical Education, Physics, and Plant and Microbial Biology require a CMF. Other courses may also require this fee. A Late Registration Fee of $150 is charged to all students who are not officially registered by Friday of the third week of instruction. An Add Fee of $5 per course is charged to students who add classes after the third week of instruction. A Drop Fee of $10 per course is charged to undergraduates who drop classes after the second week of instruction, and charged to graduate students who drop courses after the third week of instruction. All fees are automatically billed to student accounts by the Campus Accounts Receivables System (CARS) and will be reflected on students' monthly e-Bills. Requests for waiver of add/drop or late fees must be substantiated with proof that failure to meet the deadline(s) was due to the action or inaction of the University.
