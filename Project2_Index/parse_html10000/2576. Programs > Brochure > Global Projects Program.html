MITRE-Bedford Project Center Bedford, MA, United States; (Outgoing Program) Program Terms: A term This program is currently not accepting applications.  Output:    PDF    HTML  Orientation:    Portrait    Landscape Restrictions: WPI applicants only Budget Sheets: A term Dates / Deadlines: There are currently no active application cycles for this program. Fact Sheet: Program Term: A Term Project Opportunities: MQP Director: Craig Shue, Reinhold Ludwig, Sergey Makarov Center Highlights: Domestic, Low or No Cost Housing: Commute from campus Program Preparation: Summer internship Program Eligibility: Good academic standing (not on academic warning or academic probation), U.S. citizenship Major Eligibility: Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering Program Description: Location MITRE is a nonprofit organization chartered to work on federally funded research projects for the Department of Defense (DoD), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other government agencies.    All MITRE projects are conducted at the Mitre-Bedford center in Bedford, MA. Students commute from WPI to Bedford by bus. Only U.S. citizens can be considered for this program. Projects MITRE provides project opportunities for Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science majors. Most students begin with a paid internship at MITRE during the summer before their project work commences. The internship enables students to perform background research in their project areas and liaise with MITRE company mentors.   During A-Term students work full-time for approximately eight weeks, from late August through mid-October. WPI provides daily transportation from campus to Bedford at no cost to student participants. Each team works with a company-designated mentor and WPI faculty advisor. Project work concludes with an MQP report and formal presentation at MITRE.   Admission is competitive, limited to U.S. citizens, and based on academic performance, maturity, independence, and project-relevant skills determined during interviews. Project Examples An example ECE project area involves analyzing the effect of wind turbines on radar. Projects will look at computational characterization of wind farm returns, develop greater understanding of the Doppler behavior of wind turbines, generate insights into mitigation techniques, and develop dynamic adaptation/filtering in response to rotation and speed changes of the turbines.   Another ECE project area focuses on the design, computational modeling, and practical realization of small antenna systems. Research will emphasize the exploration of novel antenna topologies and special material choices.   The CS projects may have a strong focus on cyber security. An example project could look at automatically detecting and correcting kernel-level compromises to an operating system while other projects could focus on improving understanding of computer attacks.     This program is currently not accepting applications.    Output:    PDF    HTML  Orientation:    Portrait    Landscape Share This Program Share brochure link:
