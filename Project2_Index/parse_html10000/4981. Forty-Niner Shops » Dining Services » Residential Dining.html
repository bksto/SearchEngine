For many, it can be difficult living away from home. Our dining team has developed creative, nutritious menus that will meet your needs and remind you of home. Just to add a little bit more excitement and value to your dining experience, Residential Dining Services also organizes special celebrations, picnics, themed meals, and other events throughout the year. We operate two on-campus Residential Dining Halls – Parkside and Hillside - as well as the Ground Floor Coffee House and Parkside Coffee House.  Additionally, we operate the Beachside Dining Hall located just a few miles from CSULB.  Each facility has similar menus that are based on a 4-week cycle and are complimented with an “all-you-can-eat” hot-food bar, deli and salad bar, fresh fruit, soups, and desserts. Parkside and Hillside Dining Halls Monday through Friday Parkside and Hillside Dining Halls provide breakfast, lunch and dinner menus.  Brunch and dinner are hosted on Saturdays at the Hillside Dining Hall and on Sundays at the Parkside Dining Hall.  Check back regularly to see the weekly menu options for any day of the week.
