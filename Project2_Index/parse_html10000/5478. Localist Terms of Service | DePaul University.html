Guidelines for Event Submission by Non-DePaul Entities If your group or organization has an upcoming special event that may be of interest to the DePaul community, you may submit that event for consideration for our calendar. Use the “Add Event” function on the calendar; your event will automatically be sent to a moderator for consideration. Please be sure that the information you submit is accurate. If your event changes, please send the revised details immediately to events@depaul.edu. Please note that DePaul reserves the right to decline any submission, that allowing a submission does not imply endorsement by the university, and that the university is not responsible for the accuracy of information submitted by non-DePaul entities. In some cases, DePaul must decline certain types of submissions so that it does not violate federal or state regulations or university policies. These include any political events or activities not hosted by the university.
