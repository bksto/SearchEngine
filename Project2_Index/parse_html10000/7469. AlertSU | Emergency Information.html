It was reportedly seen in the vicinity of Page Mill and Peter Coutts. If you see a mountain lion DO NOT APPROACH IT, especially one that is feeding or with kittens. Most mountain lions will try to avoid confrontation. CALL 9-1-1. Here are a few tips: Avoid hiking or jogging when mountain lions are most active?dawn, dusk, and at night. If you encounter a mountain lion, do not run; instead, face the animal, make noise and try to look bigger by waving your arms; throw rocks or other objects.

Community Alert – Auto Burglaries February 9, 2015 10:36 am Categories: AlertSU, Info There have been 14 auto burglaries since the beginning of Winter Quarter. The majority of the burglaries have taken place in Parking Structure 6 (below Wilbur Field) although others have occurred in other locations on campus. To help prevent from becoming a target, the Stanford University Department of Public Safety is encouraging individuals to engage in a few simple practices: - Do not leave valuables inside a vehicle or unattended on your desk or work area. - If your vehicle is equipped with an alarm system, activate it each time you leave the vehicle unattended. - Most importantly, if you observe any suspicious activity or behavior such as an individual loitering around vehicles, peering into vehicles, and/or trying door handles, or wandering in an office area without legitimate business, call 9-1-1 immediately. Additionally, the university is encouraging individuals to encrypt their mobile devices. Information about ways to best protect your mobile devices can be found at http://www.stanford.edu/group/security/securecomputing/ If you do become the victim of a crime, please report it immediately to the local law enforcement jurisdiction. If the property which has been stolen contains sensitive or confidential data, report the theft immediately to the university?s Privacy Office at (650) 725-1828 or privacy@stanford.edu. If you have any questions, concerns, or would like additional information about crime prevention, please call the Department of Public Safety at (650)723-9633. Community Alert: Email Scam 1/17/15 January 17, 2015 9:54 am Categories: AlertSU, Info From the Stanford Department of Public Safety: The FBI has recently issued two public service announcements regarding email scams which have resulted in victims throughout the country. The first scam is known as the “Work-from-home” scam, which specifically targets university students. Students have received emails recruiting them for payroll and/or human resource positions with fictitious companies. The “position” requires the student to provide his/her bank account number under the guise of setting up direct deposit for his/her pay. The second scam is a university employee payroll scam. The employees are receiving fraudulent emails indicating a change in their human resource status. The email contains a link directing the employee to log in to their human resources website to identify this change. While the website looks very similar to the legitimate site, it is actually a bogus site where the scammers are able to steal the employee’s credentials. The scammers then use these credentials to access the employee’s direct deposit information via the actual website, redirecting their pay. To avoid becoming a victim, NEVER send money or provide personal or financial information to anyone who requests such information through an email or other solicitation, no matter how good or credible the offer sounds!
