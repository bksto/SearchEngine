Event Details Buy Advance Tickets Top Tuesday, April 7, 2015 Ópatas, Eudeves, and Jovas, and Sonoran Insurrection, an illustrated talk by David Yetman, 6:00–8:00 p.m., CESL 103, Free and Open to the Public. At the time of contact with Spaniards, Ópatas appear to have constituted the largest indigenous group in what would become the state of Sonora.Popular history in Sonora suggests that Ópatas formed the basis for the Mestizo population of the state.A careful analysis of seventeenth and eighteenth century records leads us to question this belief. It also leads us to ask, who were the Eudeves, also prominent in colonial documents, and the Jovas, less prominent but clearly present in the same region, and how were they related to Ópatas? And what relationship did the three groups have to periods of unrest and rebellion in Sonora? A reception will follow the program. David Yetman is a research social scientist at the Southwest Center of the University of Arizona.He has traveled on foot, horse, motor scooter, auto, and airplane in the Mexican state of Sonora for the last fifty-four years and has written extensively on Sonoran people, landscapes, and plants. Since 2001 Yetman has been the host of the PBS television documentary series, “The Desert Speaks” and, since 2011, “In the Americas with David Yetman.” This is a presentation of the annual Arnold and Doris Roland Distinguished Speaker Series, made possible by the generosity of Arnold and Doris Roland. Reception underwritten in part by Eldon and Jean Smith. Photo courtesy of David Yetman.
