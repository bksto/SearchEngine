The 10 libraries on our campus feature study halls, research pods, reading lounges, and more — often serving as second homes to our students. For every discipline, there is a gold mine of written resources at UCLA. Our libraries have collections and research tools ranging across every academic field, whether your focus is East Asian studies or ethnomusicology, cuneiform or folk medicine, biomedical engineering or art history. Whatever the question, UCLA libraries have the answers.

And it is apparent in our museums. From Hokusai's iconic "Great Wave" to the distinguished Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden and the Hammer Video Library, the Hammer Museum showcases the diversity of artistic expression throughout history. The Fowler Museum exhibits works from around the world, with an emphasis on Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas — past and present. Together, they act as a gateway for the entire state of California to benefit from the riches of the UCLA community.
