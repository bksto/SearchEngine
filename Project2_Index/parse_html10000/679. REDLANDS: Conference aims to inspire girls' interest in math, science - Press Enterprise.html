ERIN WALDNER, STAFF PHOTO Related article » Standing before a group of eighth-grade girls, 29-year-old Alicia Taylor shared that math wasn’t her strong point in school. Math still scares her, she said, despite having grown up to be a scientist. “But I’ve become more confident about it,” she said. “Eventually, I know I’m going to get it. It’s just going to take some time.” Taylor lead one of the workshops during a STEM conference for girls Wednesday, Feb. 25 at the University of Redlands. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. The Redlands branch of the American Association of University Women has presented the conference the past 21 years. Around 600 eighth grade girls from Yucaipa and Redlands attended this year, all at no charge. “Our mission is to show the girls how important math and science is in their future and in society’s future and to encourage them to take math and science every year in high school,” said AAUW member Kay Dobbertin, a retired math teacher. The morning was devoted to workshops conducted by women who work in various STEM fields, with topics including dentistry, optometry, geology, veterinary medicine and forensics. The girls chose two workshops to attend. “The emphasis of those is to expose them to careers that use math and science,” Dobbertin said. Workshops later in the day were designed to be motivational. Taylor, who just last week earned a PhD in environmental toxicology, spoke about her role as a scientist at UC Riverside and shared a bit of advice with the students. “One thing that I wish I could go back and tell younger me is to have more hobbies and skills,” she said. “Having hobbies and skills and learning different types of languages and how to think about things differently - all of these are going to help you in your future lives," she added. Kristine Kubose spoke about being a physical therapist and her background. She has a bachelor’s in biology from the University of California at Santa Cruz and holds other advanced degrees. Today, she co-owns a physical therapy practice in Redlands. “I love my job,” she told the girls before her. “If you have a passion, do it.” Contact the writer: 951-368-9552 or ewaldner@pe.com More from Redlands REDLANDS: Harley rider killed in intersection crash (UPDATE) COMMUNITY NOTES: Concert to pay tribute to veterans, more Former ambassador to speak at Japan Day event; Masons to celebrate 125 years; Mental illness alliance to meet; National recognition for beautifying nonprofit.
