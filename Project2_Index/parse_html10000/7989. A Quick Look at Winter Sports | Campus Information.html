But FEAR NOT my fellow Wolverines because you can escape all of these things in the oasis that is University of Michigan Athletics. With November nearing, fall sports are slowly coming to an end and nearing Big Ten Tournament play, so make sure to keep rooting on our Football, Soccer, Volleyball, Cross Country, and Field Hockey teams. Now is the time to also look foward to the exciting winter seasons our student athletes have in store. I am a die-hard Basketball fan, so my first suggestion is to check out the Men’s and Women’s teams, who are looking to have promising seasons. Both play in the Crisler Center, which is conveniently located next to the Big House. For schedules and ticketing information check out this link for the Men’s team, and this link for the Women’s. Also make sure to check out our Men’s Gymnastic team that brought the National Championship trophy back to Ann Arbor last season. It was a spectacular 2-peat! You can check out their schedule, roster, and attendance information at this link. Hockey, Women’s Gymnastics, Swimming and Diving, Indoor Track and Field, and Wrestling will all also be competing in the winter season, for more information on these teams check out MGOBLUE.com. So whatever you do remember to support our student athletes and Go Blue!     Lauren   Tags:  Sports Winter Athletics Winter Sports Winter Activities Athletic Department Athletic Tickets Michigan Athletics Fun Topic:  Blue Prints Campus Information Blog FAQ Life at Michigan For Visitors - Visiting Ann Arbor 1 2 3 4 5 Total votes: 66 Google Plus One   Chat service is staffed during standard Campus Info hours of operation.
