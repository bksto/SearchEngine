Successful applicants must exceed minimum UC admission requirements. Enrollment goals are established annually. UC San Diego admits transfer applicants at the junior level only. The campus does not select students on the basis of academic major or choice of UCSD undergraduate college. Goal Identify and admit students who are fully prepared to excel in the University's challenging academic environment – students who represent strong academic achievement, exceptional personal talent and the broad diversity of talents, abilities, personal experience, and backgrounds characteristic of California. Review process Every application, including the personal statement, is reviewed. Consideration is given for the specific factors, primarily academic, listed below. Strength in academic coursework Completion of a minimum of 60 UC-transferable semester (90 quarter) units by the end of spring term, prior to fall admission Completion of the UC-transferable college courses below with a C grade or better in each course. 2 English composition 1 mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning 4 courses from at least 2 of the following: Arts and humanities Physical and biological sciences Social and behavioral sciences Grade Point Average (GPA) One of the most important criteria considered is the GPA in UC-transferable college courses based upon the applicant's self-reported academic history. Major Preparation Applicants should complete all courses required in preparation for their major before transfer. Applicants choosing an impacted major are strongly encouraged to complete major preparation. Applicants choosing a major with pre-major status will need to complete undergraduate requirements once they've been admitted to UC San Diego. Military credit Applicants seeking military credit must submit their Sailor/Marine American Council on Education Registry Transcript (SMART), Army/American Council on Education Registry Transcript System (AARTS) or equivalent military transcript to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. UC San Diego may award lower-division units (freshman/sophomore level) for military courses completed when there is an equivalent course taught at a UC campus. UC San Diego does not grant credit for work experience, military/recruit basic training, vocational or technical training, CLEP and DSST examinations, and remedial academic or personal enrichment courses. Senior standing definition UC San Diego does not admit applicants in senior standing. Senior standing means you would have 90 or more UC-transferable semester units (or 135+ quarter units) from accredited four-year universities.
