To do so using your existing Adobe ID, simply accept your Creative Cloud for teams invitation, and you’ll be prompted to cancel your individual membership. Alternatively, you can call Customer Care for support. Be prepared to provide: Adobe ID for the primary admin of the teams membership Phone number for the primary admin Adobe IDs for the individual memberships you want to switch to the teams membership My organization wants to block access to certain services, such as storage and community features, available through Creative Cloud.

As an administrator, you will also be able to deploy Creative Cloud desktop applications independent of the cloud-based services using the Creative Cloud Packager. The Creative Cloud Packager is available through Creative Cloud for teams. Can I block my users from using Creative Cloud for teams storage? There is no way to centrally disable access to Creative Cloud storage. Any end users who have access to the web via a browser have the ability to store their files in the cloud. However, if users are on a corporate network and using company-administered machines, the following network calls can be blocked via the organization's firewall, thereby blocking use of storage while on the network: https://creative.adobe.com/api/assets https://creative.adobe.com/api/collections https://creative.adobe.com/api/share https://creative.adobe.com/files — port 443 Note: The services blocked on the website may be accessible via other endpoints not related to the site, and the site may be the only access point for services that should not be blocked. The full list of online services and their URLs are listed here. Which Creative Cloud desktop apps are available as a single app? The following are available as a single app: Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, InDesign CC, Adobe Muse CC, Dreamweaver CC, Flash Professional CC, Edge Inspect CC, Edge Animate CC, Adobe Premiere Pro CC, After Effects CC, Adobe Audition CC, SpeedGrade CC, InCopy CC, and Prelude CC. Although membership includes access to just one app, you will also have access to all other CC apps as a free 30-day trial.
