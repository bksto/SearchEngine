On-campus recruiting (OCR) for Spring 2015 runs January 26 through April 17. If you need to interview prior to January 26, please contact us and we will do our best to accommodate you. Please note that resume deadlines for interviews prior to January 26 will fall over winter break. Interviews are held Monday - Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Interviews take place in the five interview rooms at the Huff House. If your needs are such that you require additional rooms, we will make extra efforts to accommodate your requests elsewhere on campus. We cannot, however, guarantee alternate spaces on a particular date outside of this building. There are no fees for interviewing.

Log in or create a new account. From the RICElink home page, go to the Quick Link titled “Request Campus Interview Schedule(s).” Then, complete your request including the date and the position(s) for which you will be interviewing. For a detailed description of the OCR Models, please review the list below. Once your schedule is approved by the CCD, you will receive a confirmation email including parking details and building location. You are welcome to interview students in your local offices (in person or via Skype) and still use RICElink to schedule your interviews. When completing your request, simply designate “Off Campus” in the “Location” field. You may also instruct students to apply via your company’s website. However, in order to utilize the interview scheduling function in RICElink, you must also collect resumes in RICElink. OCR MODELS When creating your schedule request in RICElink, you can choose from the following OCR Models: Preselect From the students who have applied, you will select and "invite" students to sign up for an interview on your schedule. Preselect to Alternate You will "invite" students, as well as alternates, to sign up for an interview on your schedule. *Please note, if you utilize this model, alternates will be able to sign up in the last two days that your schedule is open, regardless of whether or not your preselected candidates have signed up by that date. If your preselected candidates haven't signed up by that time, their spot may be taken by an alternate. Resume Collect Students can drop their resume to your position posted in RICElink but you will manage your schedule on your own and not through RICElink. Room Reservation Only You will not use RICElink to manage your schedule or collect resumes. This is typically utilized to reserve space in our building for second round interviews. Need Assistance? RICElink FAQs Contact Us ADVERTISE YOUR POSITIONS We are happy to help you market the positions for which you're interviewing to Rice students. You may send us a flyer and/or two to three sentence description about your opportunity to Jessica Fleenor, Marketing & Events Specialist. We will distribute the flyer across campus, and also post it on our social media sites. A two to three sentence description will be included in our weekly newsletter to students and faculty, and also posted on our social media sites. You might also consider advertising in the student newspaper, The Rice Thresher.
