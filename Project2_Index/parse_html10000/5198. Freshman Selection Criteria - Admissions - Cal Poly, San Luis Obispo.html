Cal Poly continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. All students must declare a major when submitting their application. Cal Poly comprehensively reviews all applications as we look for students who have strong academic records and are active in and outside the classroom. Beyond the basic qualifications for the California State University, Cal Poly considers other factors for admission deemed important to the campus and does so in an objective format. In fact, it is impossible to predict a candidate's chances of admission by looking at the academic record alone. All candidates are objectively evaluated by the cognitive and non-cognitive variables under the faculty-mandated Multi-Criteria Admission (MCA) process. When we review your application, we consider: Your intended program of study (the major to which the application is made) Your college-preparatory courses in secondary school GPA earned in college-preparatory courses Standardized test scores Your extra-curricular activities and work experience Coursework with a Grade of C or Better CSU required coursework taken during 9th to 11th grades and in progress or planned during 12th grade.

Academic Performance College prep GPA Calculated by Cal Poly for 9th -11th grade coursework designated on the application (with honors points granted for courses designated as "honors," "college," “advanced placement" or "international baccalaureate" on a high school transcript, for up to eight semesters). Standardized Test Scores Only ACT or SAT I scores are used in the selection process. If you are applying for the Fall Quarter, scores from ACT or SAT tests taken after November are not guaranteed to be used in the selection process. Work Experience/Extra-curricular Activity Participation This information is taken only from the four questions found on the CSUMentor application. All information is subject to change without prior notice. Please Note: Applicants to the majors of Art & Design and Music may not apply through the Early Admissions Decision program since a portfolio or audition is required for those majors. Select applicants to the Art and Design and Music majors will be invited to submit either an portfolio for Art and Design or schedule an audition for the Music department (or submit an audition recording).  Qualified applicants for both programs will be notified in mid- January with submission information.  Interested applicants can link to the Art and Design website or Music website for more information.
