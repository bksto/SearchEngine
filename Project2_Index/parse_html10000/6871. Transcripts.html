Transcripts are issued at the written request of the student or appropriate institutions and officials. Official transcripts of the student's ASU permanent record are issued on security paper with the seal of the University. Transcripts which have been presented for admission or evaluation of credit become a part of the student's permanent record and are not reissued. Transcripts from other institutions, if needed, must be obtained directly from the original issuing institution. Transfer students should obtain, for advisor use in scheduling, a reference copy of their academic record from each institution attended. Transcripts or other evidence of attendance will not be issued to or for a student who is in debt to the university. We will NOT release high school transcripts or transcripts from any other institution. You MUST contact the high school or the other institution to acquire your transcript. No information will be released on students who have a financial obligation to the university. Obtaining an Official Copy of Your Transcript Online Requests Transcripts are free if ordered online through Self Service AND picked up after 24 hours or if we mail to your requested destination.
