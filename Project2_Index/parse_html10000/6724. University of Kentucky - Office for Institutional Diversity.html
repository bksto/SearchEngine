President's Welcome Dr. Eli Capilouto President, University of Kentucky   Welcome from Dr. Capilouto   More... Calendar About Us Central to the work of UK’s Office for Institutional Diversity (OID) is Goal IV of the University Strategic Plan:  Promote Diversity and Inclusion. Towards achievement of this goal, OID  serves the entire university community and provides support and collaboration to the Office for Community Engagement. The vice president, assistant vice president and OID directors work across academic and non-academic units to implement ideas, collaborate on outreach and recruitment efforts, and to enhance student retention and achievement. OID staff provide consultation and assistance to the various colleges in developing diversity and inclusion strategies and metrics in their individual strategic plans. We work with the Office for Institutional Research and Institutional Effectiveness to help both academic and non-academic units make sense and use of data collected on students, faculty and staff, particularly as the information has implications for campus climate and inclusiveness efforts. OID works closely with the Office for Community Engagement in support of UK’s community outreach and service efforts. Issues of grievances, workplace conflicts and Affirmative Action should be directed to the Office of Institutional Equity and Equal Opportunity.   The OID organizational chart can be downloaded here.
