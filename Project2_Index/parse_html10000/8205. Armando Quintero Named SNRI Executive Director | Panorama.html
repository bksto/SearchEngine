He’ll also directly support the research, including the new multicampus UC Water Security and Sustainability Research Initiative, designed to build a strategic base of water knowledge to help California and the nation achieve a water-secure future. Quintero serves on the Marin Municipal Water Board and has worked for the National Park Service as a park ranger at Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Point Reyes National Seashore, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the John Muir National Historic Site. Quintero said he’s honored by his selection as the new SNRI executive director. “It is an extraordinary privilege to be working with researchers whose work is focused on sustainable solutions for the world,” he said.     Questions?
