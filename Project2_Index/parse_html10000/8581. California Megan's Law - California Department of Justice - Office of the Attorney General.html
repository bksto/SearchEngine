ATTENTION: FEDERAL COURT ENJOINS COLLECTION OF E-MAIL AND SOCIAL NETWORKING INFORMATION ON REGISTRATION FORMS. On January 11, 2013, a federal court enjoined the Attorney General and law enforcement agencies from collecting information pertaining to e-mail addresses, internet service providers, and social networking/screen names on sex offender registration forms. These fields will not appear on the 2013 DOJ registration forms (DOJ forms 8047, 8102).This injunction is in effect until the lawsuit challenging these provisions of Proposition 35, the Californians Against Sexual Exploitation (CASE) Act, is decided or until further notice. (John Doe v. Kamala Harris, Northern District of California No. C12-5713 TEH). Registering law enforcement agencies should black out these fields on the 2012 forms, and should not collect this information until further notice ATTENTION: Beginning January 1, 2013, the Department of Justice is required by law to post static risk assessment scores for sex offender registrants who are eligible to be scored (Penal Code § 290.03-290.09). For information relating to risk assessments, eligibility, and scoring, please visit the State Authorized Risk Assessment Tool for Sex Offenders (SARATSO) Web site at www.saratso.org Information contained in this site is based on information provided by local law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice entities. Pursuant to California law, the Department of Justice is authorized to provide specified information on persons required to register in California as sex offenders. Specific home addresses are displayed on more than 41,055 offenders. An additional 11,415 offenders are included on the site with listing by ZIP Code, city, and county. Pursuant to Penal Code § 290.46, information on approximately 30,512 other offenders is not included on this site and cannot be posted online, but is known to law enforcement personnel. The Department of Justice cannot vouch for sex offender information disclosed on alternate web sites. Some sex offender web sites retrieve information from non-official sources which may contain out-dated information. The information contained in this site is updated daily and extracted from the statewide database used exclusively by law enforcement. Once you have read and acknowledged the disclaimer on the next page, you may search the database by a sex offender's specific name, obtain ZIP Code and city/county listings, obtain detailed personal profile information on each registrant, and use our map application to search your neighborhood or anywhere throughout the State to determine the specific location of any of those registrants on whom the law allows us to display a home address. By law, a registered sex offender is prohibited from accessing the sex offender site. However, a registrant is allowed to view the information provided in the Megan’s Law Home Page. Not all sex offenders have been caught and convicted. Many sex offenses are committed by family, friends or acquaintances of the victim.

This website indicates that some of these registrants are currently in violation of their registration requirements. Any information you may have on these individuals should be reported to your local law enforcement agency. ATTENTION: There is no service through a private company that can remove registrants from this site. To be removed from this site, a registrant can apply for exclusion with the DOJ and if they meet the requirements of California Penal Code section 290.46 (e), the DOJ will exclude them from this site. However, a person who has filed for or been granted an exclusion from the Internet Web site is not relieved of his or her duty to register as a sex offender pursuant to Section 290 nor from any otherwise applicable provision of law. If a registrant’s requirement to register has been terminated per court order, the registrant can contact the DOJ for a registration record review.
