Whether it is national leadership in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle research, real-world demonstrations of new lighting technology or re-calculating livestock contributions to global warming — our research is making a difference and making headlines. Research news 12.17.14 — UC Davis to help in UC effort to study effects of climate change on ecosystems Researchers at UC Davis, working with colleagues at the other UC campuses, have developed an ambitious plan to use the UC Natural Reserve System to detect and forecast the ecological impacts of climate change in California. 12.10.14 — Cloudy water, even if it’s safe, affects rural immigrants’ health Cloudy tap water may have a greater effect for California’s rural immigrants than merely leaving behind a bad taste, according to a new policy brief released by the Center for Poverty Research at UC Davis. 12.4.14 — Condors with greater independence have higher lead levels As California condors return from the brink of extinction, the threat of lead poisoning persists, particularly for older, more independent condors, according to a study led by UC Davis. 11.20.14 — Expanding California’s water supply: You can’t store what isn’t there California’s approval of a $7.5 billion water bond has bolstered prospects for expanding reservoirs and groundwater storage, but the drought-prone state can effectively use no more than a 15 percent increase in surface water storage capacity because of lack of water to fill it, according to a new analysis released Nov. 20. 11.1.14 — Hot crops Researchers at UC Davis and around the world are scrambling to develop new varieties of food and fiber crops that will produce abundant yields despite drought and other effects of climate change. They’re also exploring more water-efficient ways to grow existing crops. 10.22.14 — No-till agriculture may not bring hoped-for boost in global crop yields, study finds No-till farming, a key conservation agriculture strategy that avoids conventional plowing and otherwise disturbing the soil, may not bring a hoped-for boost in crop yields in much of the world, according to an extensive new meta-analysis by an international team led by UC Davis. 10.15.14 — After the crash: Butterflies rely on connections amid changing climate Butterflies in Canadian mountain meadows rebounded after a severe population crash. Why? It’s all about connections, found a study by UC Davis in collaboration with Western University in Ontario, Canada, and other North American institutions. 9.24.14 — Good catch: Fishermen clean ocean of lost crabbing gear California’s rugged North Coast lays claim to one of the state’s most valuable commercial fisheries: Dungeness crab. Millions of pounds of this meaty delicacy are pulled in each year from Morro Bay to the California-Oregon border, making for an industry valued at $32 million to $95 million per year. But there’s another catch: Many of the thousands of crab pots set in the sea don’t make their way back. Now, a group of fishermen collaborating with UC Davis are working to remove the lost crabbing gear from the ocean and sell it back to the original owners under what they hope will be an economically sustainable model for future cleanups. 9.16.14 — Global shift to mass transit could save more than $100 trillion and 1,700 megatons of CO2 More than $100 trillion in public and private spending could be saved between now and 2050 if the world expands public transportation, walking and cycling in cities, according to a new report released by UC Davis and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. Additionally, reductions in carbon dioxide emissions reaching 1,700 megatons per year in 2050 could be achieved if this shift occurs. 9.11.14 — University lights the way for hospital energy savings As ambulances at a Vacaville hospital speed off to their next patient, an ultrasmart, energy-efficient system is lighting the way. Installed in partnership with UC Davis, the lighting system now illuminates the emergency vehicle routes, parking lots and outdoor walkways of the NorthBay VacaValley Hospital. The system is reducing outdoor lighting energy use at the 24-hour site by 66 percent, saving about 29,000 kilowatt-hours annually -- enough to offset the greenhouse gas emissions of 7.2 tons of waste. Features UC Davis West Village: Setting the standard The University of California, Davis, West Village, the nation’s largest planned zero net energy community, racks up an impressive list of achievements in its initial year of review. The first formal analysis of West Village shows that even in its initial phases, it is well on the way to the ultimate goal of operating as a ZNE community. UC Davis turns on Smart Lighting to save energy, be model for Californians UC Davis has pledged to reduce lighting energy use by 60 percent by 2015. World’s 'greenest' winery, brewery and foods facility opens on campus A newly completed complex at UC Davis is set to begin operations as the most environmentally sophisticated complex of its kind in the world. UC Davis takes the lead on clean energy, with Schwarzenegger's backing UC Davis is taking a leadership role in spurring the innovations, ideas and dialogue that are needed to help create a clean energy future for Northern California — and beyond.
