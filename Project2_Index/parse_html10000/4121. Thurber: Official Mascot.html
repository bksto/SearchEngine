He is known as a very active and friendly mascot, and is the subject of a blog called “Thurb’s Blurbs.” He attends sporting events when possible and is known to give “high fives.” Thurber is a favorite subject of University photographers and seems to enjoy the considerable attention he receives from the campus community. President James Appleton collaring Thurber as the University Mascot on Sept. 18, 2010 When not occupied with their mascot duties, Thurber and sometimes his grandpa, Duke, typically can be found in their kennel at the Willis Center. Thurber surveys his kingdom Thurber and Duke try to appear at as many University functions as possible. If you are interested in having Thurber or Duke attend your campus event, contact Student Life.
