Our 16 intercollegiate teams compete in the American Athletic Conference, and they’ve won 33 titles in the past 10 years. Fans turn out in force to cheer on the Cougars and participate in a variety of Cougar traditions. Cougar spirit can be found beyond the stadiums, courts and fields of intercollegiate sports. Opportunities to play in sports clubs (including fencing, tae kwon do and team handball), on intramural teams (such as table tennis, soccer and dodge ball) and even simple “pick-up” games can be found all over campus. The UH Campus Recreation and Wellness Center offers world-class exercise equipment and facilities for an assortment of recreational activities. There, students, staff, faculty and alumni can be found working out, rock-wall climbing, enjoying aquatics activities and more -- all under one roof! UH is a great place to indulge the senses with a performance or an art exhibit. Stages on campus host dance, musical and theatrical performances throughout the year. The Blaffer Art Museum at the University of Houston rotates beautiful and thought-provoking art exhibitions. Our diverse student body lends unique flavors to both creative works and campus surroundings. The sculptures that adorn the outdoor parks, plazas and buildings make the UH campus a feast for the eyes and a wonderful place to relax with friends and family.
