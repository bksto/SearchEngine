Jump to Navigation Instructional Development | production services production services Introduction Instructional Development provides a full range of media production services to support the instructional, research, and administrative needs of the campus. Services range from computer graphics and photography to sound recording and video services. All production services are now available on a cost-recovery basis. The first priority for the production units is to support instruction on the UCSB campus. Instructional Development will provide service to faculty during the regular academic year in order to develop materials for any course listed in the current Schedule of Classes or to prepare for any course listed in the current General Catalog which will be offered within one academic year on a cost recovery basis, but with priority of service. Funding for substantial instructional projects may be avialable through the Instructional Improvement program (call x2972 for information) or Collaborate in the College of Letters and Science.    Changes in Production Support for Course Materials Effective July 1, 2012 For many years a substantial portion of Instructional Development's budget that was allocated to supporting the Production Units (ArtWorks, Photo Services, Video Services and Sound Recording) was funded from core state funds. Originally the whole budget was core funded and all production services were free. With the budget cuts of the mid 1990s the production areas had to shift to a split-funded model of providing a certain level of production support for development of curricular materials for free, based on state support for that activity, and providing support for non-instructional production on a recharge basis. The last three years of permanent budget cuts in core funding for Instructional Development has now eliminated our ability to maintain any level of free support for the development of course materials in our production areas (ArtWorks, Photo Services, Sound Recording, and Video Services). This was after two years of reduced support that went into effect on July 1, 2010. The new funding model will go into effect on July 1, 2012. Henceforth, course materials produced by Instructional Development Production Areas will have to be paid for either through recharge to the faculty member's department, an Instructional Improvement Grant, or Collaborate Curriculum Enhancement Mini-Grants for faculty in the College of Letters and Science, cash or credit card. The only exceptions to this are video conferencing for courses and the recording of replacement lectures, which will remain free of charge. As has always been the case, production of non-instructional materials will be done on a cost-recovery, recharge basis, as is production of materials for student projects (e.g. poster printing, portfolio recordings, etc.). Rates for all services are posted on our web site. We have not taken this step lightly, nor without already making reductions in other areas of expenditure within Instructional Development, including cutting staff positions, substantially reduced student assistance, reductions in the Instructional Improvement Grants Program, elimination of the Faculty Mini-Grant Program, elimination of the TA Instructional Grants Program, elimination of the TA Departmental Grants Program, elimination of printed ESCI reports, and other cost saving and consolidation measures. This step is a necessary reflection of the economic reality with which we are confronted, while still trying to provide as many of the essential instructional support services that it is our mission to provide to the campus. I would also like to assure you that in the event that increased core funding becomes available in the future, we will make every effort to reestablish an allocation of free production support for the development of instructional materials, or a Faculty Mini-Grant program to help cover those expenses. production contacts roberta bloommanager, artworks1140 Kerr Hallroberta.bloom@id.ucsb.edu work805-893-3789 tony mastresmanager, photo services1120 Kerr Halltony.mastres@id.ucsb.edu work805-893-2448 mark ramosSound Recording Engineer2110 Kerr Hallmark.ramos@id.ucsb.edu todd gillespiemanager, video services1204 Kerr Halltodd.gillespie@id.ucsb.edu work805-893-8160   overview consultation grants production classroom services contact us Search Search this site: production artworks photographic services sound recording video services Overview | Consultation | Grants | Production | Classroom Services | Contact Us | Office of Academic Programs | UC Santa Barbara Copyright © 2015 The Regents of University of California, All Rights Reserved.
