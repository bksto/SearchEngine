We invite you to visit our beautiful campus, to attend and participate in some of our events and become a part of our community and our family. UCR hosts a variety of events and performers each week, all made available to the public via our Happenings page.  A day-to-day list of every event scheduled on campus can be found on the online Events Calendar.

ARTSblock Three spaces — the Barbara and Art Culver Center of the Arts, the California Museum of Photography and the Sweeney Art Gallery — form ARTSblock; a regional performing and visual arts center. ARTSblock is the result of a collaborative effort between UCR and the city of Riverside to bring new and ambitious art exhibits and events to Southern California. UC Riverside Presents UC Riverside Presents is a bi-monthly performing arts presentation that brings performers and performances to the university for the enjoyment of students and art lovers alike.

UCR Botanic Gardens The UCR Botanic Gardens is a living plant museum with more than 3,500 plant species from around the world for visitors and researchers to see and study. It was established primarily for teaching purposes. In a beautiful setting, the gardens serves to provide a wide assortment of plant materials for courses at UCR and other local schools. Lifelong Learning (Select UNEX Classes) The UC Riverside Osher Lifelong Learning Institute was created to provide people over the age of 50 the opportunity to continue their education through stimulating courses taught in a variety of subjects. Our courses are only open to OLLI members, so learning takes place in a peer environment. There are no tests or grades and no entrance exams or minimum educational background restrictions — the only requirement is a love of learning.
