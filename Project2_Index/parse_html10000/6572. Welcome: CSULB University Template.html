President F. King Alexander has directed that the University Template be used without modification, save for the layout areas of web pages built with the template. The University Template is provided with seven different layouts designed to provide managers with great flexibility while preserving an overall standard for visual consistency and accessibility. Banners, subsidiary graphics and page layouts are to be included at the discretion of the web managers, with art direction provided by Jorge Hurtado of Public Affairs & Publications.
