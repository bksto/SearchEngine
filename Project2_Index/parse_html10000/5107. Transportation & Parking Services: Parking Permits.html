Short-term, 2-hour visitor parking is available in lot spaces designated as Pay-By-Space or Dispenser parking. Permits for students, faculty and staff are lot specific. Lot entrance signs will display the appropriate permit required in each lot.

Parking Permits are the property of the University and: are for use by the registered permit holder only; are non-transferable; may not be resold; may not be altered. Parking on campus is viewed as a privilege and as such Transportation and Parking Services reserves the right to refuse, revoke or deny parking privileges. The University assumes no responsibility for any vehicle or its contents while being operated or parked on UC Riverside property. Parking regulations may change without notice if deemed necessary. Leave your car at home. Enjoy the ease and convenience of UCR’s public transit program. Use alternative transportation (Vanpool, Carpool, Bike, or Bus). Incentives are available! Avoid the crowds. Purchase your permit through our secure web portal. Order your parking permit early enough for it to arrive in the mail, before you need it. Give yourself plenty of time to park and walk to your campus destination. We suggest arriving 30 minutes prior to your scheduled class time or appointment. Avoid inner campus roads at peak commute hours. Campus Drive becomes congested, particularly during class changes. Review the posted lot entrance signs before you park to ensure your permit is valid in that lot. Park head-in and within the lines at the correct angle allowing other drivers parking vehicles next to you adequate space to exit and enter their vehicle. LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE SECURE. The University is not responsible for parking lot theft. Lock your vehicle. Keep valuables locked in your vehicle trunk or take them with you. Report any supicious behavior of individuals or supicious vehicles. Check our website or follow us on twitter for updates on parking lots and road conditions.
