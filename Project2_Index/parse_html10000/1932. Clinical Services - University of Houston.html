Our approach draws upon the latest scientific information about the ingredients to relationship success. The services are appropriate for couples who are experiencing specific relationship difficulties as well as those who want to make an already good relationship even better. All services are made available to any couple including cohabitating, separated, and gay and lesbian couples. Cognitive Development Lab The research goal of the Cognitive Development Lab is to explore children's language learning environment and their early development of different types of words (e.g., color words, objects' names, and words for different actions) to investigate what really contributes to children's language learning and how such learning may change over time. The lab particularly studies infant's and children's language learning as a tool to deepen our understanding of the learning processes. The lab welcomes children who are themselves growing scientists to help us get more insight into these processes. The University Speech, Language and Hearing Clinic The University Speech, Language, and Hearing Clinic: A United Way Facility, offers services to infants, children, and adults with speech, language, and/or hearing impairments. These services include testing and treatment. The clinic also offers assistance with the fitting and sales of hearing aids. This agency is partially funded by the United Way of Greater Houston and staffed by professionals certified in the fields of audiology and speech-language pathology.
