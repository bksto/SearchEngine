This is an opportunity to team up with local alumni and global and local causes to accomplish what may otherwise not be possible or imaginable." -Dick Soo Hoo AB '72, Harvard Club of the Merrimack Valley For nearly a decade, the Harvard Alumni Association's Global Month of Service (GMOS)—held each April—has been the centerpiece of the opportunities the HAA and its affiliated alumni organizations create for Harvard alumni to become more involved with public service and social engagement throughout the year. GMOS activities connect Harvard's alumni, current students, faculty and staff, and their friends and families through a diverse range of service activities organized primarily through Harvard Clubs and Shared Interest Groups, both domestically and abroad.
