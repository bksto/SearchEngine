Jump to Navigation Accreditation Apply Visit Info Accreditation   Welcome to UC Merced’s Accreditation website. Here you will find complete information related to UC Merced’s accreditation by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC).   UC Merced was granted Initial Accreditation in July 2011 for a seven year period, the maximum term possible for a newly accredited institution. This achievement confirms our educational effectiveness as demonstrated through a comprehensive, multi-year review process.  Most importantly, it reflects the dedication of our faculty, students, and staff to pursuing excellence in our mission of teaching, research, and service.   In 2014, we submitted an Interim Report to WSCUC documenting our progress since confirmation of Initial Accreditation. Our next comprehensive accreditation review will take place during the 2017-18 academic year. Please return to this site for updates on our reaffirmation of accreditation efforts.   Chancellor Dorothy Leland   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   UC Merced Accreditation Liaision Officer Laura E.
