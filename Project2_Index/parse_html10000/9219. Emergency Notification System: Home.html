When Will The System Be Used? Privacy & Confidentiality Helpful Links Frequently Asked Questions Contacts Announcements On the Horizon Important Announcement from Associate Vice Chancellor Rowley The University of California Riverside is committed to providing a safe and secure environment to campus students, faculty, staff, and visitors. UCR engages in a broad array of activities supporting this goal, including comprehensive training for police and other safety related personnel, disaster and emergency preparedness planning, as well as a host of other activities aimed at preventing problems before they occur. To enhance UCR's emergency preparedness, the campus has launched a new emergency communications system. This new system will build on existing methods of information distribution and communication, and will greatly expand UCR's ability to quickly and reliably communicate with students, staff, and faculty in an emergency. The initial deployment of the new system will focus on emergency text messaging. In a crisis, this mode of communication will serve as a reliable tool enabling UCR police and safety personnel to contact the entire campus community. Future enhancements will include the ability to deliver messages to instant messaging accounts, campus digital displays, voice mail boxes, and a wide variety of other personal and business communications devices. UCR encourages everyone on campus to sign up for this new emergency notification service, and also to become aware of the various programs, initiatives, and practices already in place aimed at making the campus the as safe and secure as possible.
