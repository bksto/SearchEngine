But the CSU is affected by federal issues as well, and three CSUSM students learned firsthand what it’s like to take advocacy to the next level. The occasion was CSU Hill Day, an annual day of advocacy in Washington, D.C., held this year on February 26. Cal State D.C. participants Carrie Martin (third from left) and Kristine Diaz (second from right), and CSU Student Trustee Cipriano Vargas (second from left) joined College of Humanities, Arts, Behavioral and Social Sciences Dean Adam Shapiro and the President’s Office Chief of Staff/Associate Vice President for Institutional Planning and Analysis Matt Ceppi on Capitol Hill for a day of meetings with federal legislators, including Congressman Duncan Hunter (center). The group focused its efforts on advocating for the funding for Federal Pell Grants, student loans and work study opportunities, along with issues related to foster youth, veterans, and first-generation and under-represented college students.
