What You Should Know Privacy-first policies ensure a trusted web experience and build confidence for a personalized Internet moving forward. Your privacy is important. Here's how we respect it. Consumers Website Publishers Here's a quick summary, please review our full Privacy Policy for more detail. AddThis is a member of the leading advertising industry groups focused on privacy, notification, and choice. Our industry has created standards to ensure that users can see how their data is being collected and choose what they share. We are active members of the two industry organizations that guard user privacy – the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). We comply with the NAI's Code and the DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, and we implement the Evidon best practices for opt-outs and notifications. Read more about our partnerships. We don't install any tracking software on your computer. The only time AddThis has access to any browsing data is when you visit a website that uses AddThis. If you use one of our browser extensions, we don't send your browsing activity to our servers. We don't have access to personally identifiable information unless you explicitly provide it to us. For example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf, we will use the email addresses in order to deliver that message. We will not share this information, and it will be removed from our system automatically after a short period. We do not have access to other personal information. We do have access to a certain amount of non-personally identifying information about you. All web sites, including those with AddThis installed, receive information such as which web page you came from, which type of browser you are using, and your general geographic location. When you and others use our tools to share content, we aggregate data about what pages are shared, when, and how. We also assign your web browser a unique identifier. This ID doesn't, and can't, say anything about you, it's just a random series of numbers and letters we use to distinguish users from each other. We do use aggregate data to offer reporting to websites that use AddThis. We provide analytics to help website owners better understand their visitors. For example, we use a randomly generated ID assigned to each web browser to tell a website publisher how many people are sharing content. We also use aggregate browsing data to tell a website publisher whether the people most likely to share their content with their friends, for example, are sports fans. We do help advertisers reach large groups of people that express similar interests and behaviors. We believe more relevant advertising provides a better Internet experience. This is also how we support our business with a service that is free to you. For example, we may help an advertiser reach people who are interested in technology. In some cases, this may mean that you receive a "cookie" from an advertising partner. You can manage your industry-wide advertising preferences at AboutAds.info. We do allow you to opt out of data collection for the purposes of advertising at any time. You can easily stop AddThis from collecting any information about you for online behavioral advertising by opting out. This will prevent advertisers from receiving any data that could be used to tailor advertising for you. This will also prevent websites that use AddThis from learning about your interests in order to personalize their content or services for you.

We do require you to let your visitors know you are using tools that may collect data for the purposes of Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA). The latest industry best practices and the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising recommend that users be made aware any time data may be used for the purposes of OBA. In support of those principles and our membership in the NAI, our Terms of Service require you to provide such notice. If you don't already notify your visitors, Section 10 of our Terms of Service includes sample language recommended by the NAI.
