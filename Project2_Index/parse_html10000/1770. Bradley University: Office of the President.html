Her goal was for the University to provide “its students the means of living an independent, industrious and useful life by the aid of a practical knowledge of the useful arts and sciences.” Lydia Moss Bradley and her mission are still relevant today. Bradley graduates are leaders, entrepreneurs and change-makers in whatever field they choose. They are inspired, challenged and encouraged by exceptional faculty who engage them in intellectual discussions, collaborate on interesting research and know them by their first names. Several of the early buildings on campus are as stunning as when the University first opened its doors. Today, 115 years later and with amazing new academic, recreational and athletic facilities, the campus abounds with the same beauty, energy and promise for the future. As President of Bradley University, my passion for our students and commitment to their success is a top priority that I work toward each and every day. I invite you to visit campus and discover all that is Bradley — the vast curricular and co-curricular opportunities, the beautiful park-like setting and most of all the special people who work tirelessly in providing the best education possible for our valued students.
