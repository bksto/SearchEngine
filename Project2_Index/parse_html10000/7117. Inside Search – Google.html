The Evolution of Google Search Learn about Google by exploring innovations, features and milestones in Search since our founding in 1997. Google Search launched 9/4/97 Larry and Sergey, Stanford computer science grad students who have collaborated for the past year on a search engine hosted on Stanford servers called BackRub, decide to rename their search engine. After some brainstorming, they go with Google—a play on the word “googol”—a mathematical term for the number represented by the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros. First Doodle 8/30/98 The tradition of homepage doodles is born when Larry and Sergey incorporate the iconic Burning Man into the Google logo before heading to the Burning Man festival in Nevada. Languages 5/9/00 Acting on our mission to organize the world's information, we launch Google.com in 10 additional languages: French, German, Italian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Norwegian and Danish. Search Index 6/26/00 Google ushers in a new millennium, century, decade, and web search era by becoming the world's largest web search index. Languages 9/12/00 Google begins offering search in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, bringing our total number of supported languages to 15. But (still!) no Klingon. Google Toolbar 12/11/00 Get it now The release of the browser plug-in Google Toolbar makes it possible to do Google searches without going to our homepage. In other words, now you can use Google across the web without visiting Google.com by simply downloading our Google Toolbar and tucking it in your browser. Languages 3/27/01 Not content with the slow process of translating our Google interface one language at a time into the innumerable tongues spoken around the world, Google implements a translation console that allows users to help speed the process. Now any Googler can volunteer to translate part or all of our pages into any one of more than 100 different languages. Already, volunteers have converted Google into Catalan, Afrikaans, Russian and Czech, with more languages being added on a weekly basis. As of this day, Google.com is available in 26 languages. Google Image Search 7/28/01 Try it now If a picture is worth a thousand words, what about a million pictures? Or to be more precise 250 million pictures?
