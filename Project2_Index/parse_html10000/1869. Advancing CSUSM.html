Thanks to our generous donors, enthusiastic president, deans, faculty, volunteers, advancement staff and partners across the University community, we surpassed our goal and raised over 60 percent more than we did last year—a total of $162,000 for student scholarships, faculty development and student programming. The gala is always a wonderful reminder to me that Advancement is a campus-wide team effort. Every one of us—no matter our role—plays an important part in building a culture of giving on our campus and in our community. Thank you for what you do to support student success and share the good work of our University with others. It is inspiring . . . and it is working! In this issue of Advancing CSUSM, we are pleased to update you on recent developments in the division. As we all prepare for another academic year, I remain grateful to all of you in our CSUSM family who have made a difference in our efforts – and I look forward to celebrating even more achievements with you in the months ahead.
