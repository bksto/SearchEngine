Filing the FAFSA is your first step in applying for financial aid. Important facts you should know about FAFSA: You must file a FAFSA before each academic year to be considered for financial aid. The FAFSA application opens January 1 each year. The UCSD school code for your FAFSA is 001317. The U.S. government, California, and UCSD base financial aid, including grants, loans, and work-study, on the FAFSA. To receive priority funding, file your FAFSA no later than March 2 each year. We recommend using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to complete your FAFSA. The FAFSA requires current tax information. You may submit your FAFSA on time even if you have not yet filed taxes using tax estimates. Later use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to update your FAFSA with your actual tax numbers. If you are not eligible to use the data retrieval tool, you will need to verify your tax information with an IRS Tax Transcript. Electronic tax filers will be able to access tax information approximately 2 to 3 weeks after filing. Paper filers will be able to access tax information 6 to 8 weeks after filing. To receive priority funding, submit all financial aid documents by May 21 each year. The Financial Aid Office may ask you for additional documents after you file your FAFSA. Check your UCSD e-mail account often, and make sure you submit any additional documents or clear any FAFSA rejects by May 21.
