Talking about Southwest Cultures ASM Home Blog Index About An App for Fitness and History Posted by falk on 12/22/2014 Today’s post by Michael Ornelas might help with New Year’s resolutions to get fit and to discover more about Arizona’s rich cultural history. Michael is a 6th generation Navajo weaver and online applications programmer for the Arizona State Museum. He graduated with a degree in Computer Science from the University of Arizona and has been an avid gamer for many years. Looking for a fun exercising program, I happened on an iPhone app called Ingress (also available for Android). It’s an “alternate reality game” where users play in the real world. My first night with Ingress will be something I’ll always remember. … » Read more » Posted in Uncategorized Learning about Barcoding Collections Posted by falk on 07/02/2014 This blog is written by Melanie Deer, Arizona State Museum Curatorial Specialist for Archaeological Collections about her experience as a Smithsonian Affiliations Visiting Professional. This program is open for staff of museums who are Smithsonian Affiliates. Smithsonian Affiliations is a national outreach program that develops long-term, collaborative partnerships with museums, educational, and cultural organizations to enrich communities with Smithsonian resources. There are more than 180 Smithsonian Affiliates in more than 40 states, Puerto Rico and Panama. ASM has been a member since 2000. I recently had the opportunity to spend two weeks at the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) in order to study their barcoding system used to assist in managing collections. ASM has been considering using barcoding and I felt this was a great opportunity to determine if it is something that would benefit us or not before putting the time and effort into actually starting a barcoding system. … » Read more » Posted in Museum Jobs, People, Research/Reports from the Field, Uncategorized | Tagged anthropology, Arizona State Museum, barcoding collections, collections care, cultural preservation, museum, museum collections, National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Affiliate, Smithsonian Affiliations, Smithsonian Affiliations Visiting Professionals Program, Smithsonian Institution From Bookcase to Exhibit Case: Literacy Learning at the Museum Posted by falk on 06/09/2014 Today’s blog was written by Michelle Andaloro, a graduate student in the Language, Reading & Culture masters program in College of Education at the University of Arizona. This spring, she was an intern in ASM’s education department where she explored using museum exhibits to promote early literacy learning. When you think of literacy, which type of public institution first comes to mind? Of course, libraries are nearly synonymous with literacy, but what about museums? Among their many roles, museums serve as storytellers who help visitors read the world, but they can also help visitors read and write in general. By design, museums provide stacks of literacy learning opportunities for a range of literacy levels, from early language learners to adults. … » Read more » Posted in Museum Experiences, Projects and Programs | Tagged anthropology, Arizona State Museum, literacy, museum, museum education, object-based literacy, reading in museums Saguaro Fruit Harvesting — Use a kuipud to pluck the bahidaj from the ha:san. Posted by falk on 05/14/2014 This post was written by Lisa Falk with tons of input from ASM volunteer Jan Nash. She and her husband John constructed a ha:san (saguaro) for the museum’s Culture Craft Saturday activities. Now, children can try their hand at picking bahidaj (saguaro fruit) using a miniature version of a kuipud, the traditional tool the Tohono O’odham use to pluck the ripe, nutritious fruit each summer. Our next gallery “harvest” session will be this Saturday, May 17th from 10am-4pm. Free with museum admission (children receive free admission, but need to bring an adult with them). When Jan Nash answered our call for a volunteer to help with a unique project for ASM’s education department, she didn’t realize the challenges she would encounter. We needed someone to take the remnants of a model saguaro and give it new life. It needed arms added and a cover with flowers and removable fruit. She shared her thoughts about the process: … » Read more » Posted in Museum Experiences, People, Projects and Programs | Tagged anthropology, Arizona State Museum, crafts, Culture Craft Saturday, museum education, museum volunteers, saguaro, sewing, Tohono O'odham A Culture of Science and the Science of Culture Posted by falk on 05/08/2014 Today’s blog is written by Beth McClendon, program assistant in ASM’s education office. In a few weeks she will graduate with a BA in anthropology and art history with a minor in ecology and evolutionary biology from the University of Arizona. Because of her experience at ASM, first as an intern and then as a student employee, she has decided to pursue a career in museum education. We wish her luck on her journey. Schools across the United States are focusing on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) studies in an effort to prepare students for future jobs in this sector. This is part of the greater aim to maintain our nation’s competitive edge in the global marketplace as well as further security, sustainability, and energy independence. The current administration started an initiative that invests in STEM programs both in the private and public sector, and funds teacher training in these subjects. This new emphasis on promoting a culture of science benefits society as a whole (especially considering statistics on science literacy rates), but as an institution that specializes in cultural studies, how do you remain competitive? One answer is to work within the new framework, incorporating science in with culture studies, providing a cross-disciplinary approach. … » Read more » Posted in Exhibits, Museum Experiences, Objects and their Stories, Projects and Programs, Uncategorized | Tagged anthropology, Arizona State Museum, cultural preservation, cultural studies, education, environmental studies, human adaptations, museum, museum education, Objects and their Stories, science, science education Continuing the Basketry Tradition Posted by ASMedu on 04/14/2014 Today’s blog post was written by Terrol Dew Johnson, an award-winning contemporary Tohono O’odham artist and guest curator for the contemporary section of the Basketry Treasured exhibit.

Contemporary weavers are using their cultural history, weaving skills and artistic inspiration to bring basketry onto a new, exciting era. To me, contemporary basket weaving is a fusion of two worlds, using traditional techniques with new materials, shapes and sizes. Today’s weavers are stepping out of their traditional realm and incorporating new ideas, while keeping the vital tradition of weaving alive. … » Read more » Posted in Exhibits, Objects and their Stories, People | Tagged American Indian weaving, Annie Antone, Apache, Arizona State Museum, Basketry Treasured, baskets, Carol Emarthle Douglas, coiled basketry, cultural preservation, Elsie Holiday, Eric Otter Bacon, Gail Tremblay, Haida basketry, Lisa Telford, Lola Mae Thomas, Native American baskets, Navajo, Objects and their Stories, Passamaquoddy, sumac baskets, Terri Goode, Terrol Dew Johnson, Tohono O'odham, willow miniature baskets, yucca baskets A Mammothly Good Time Posted by ASMedu on 04/02/2014 Today’s post was written by Thomas McDonough, senior in the History Department at the University of Arizona. He is interning in ASM’s education department this spring. ASM diorama Did you know mammoths once roamed the Southwest? Indeed they did: 13,000 years ago! Currently at Arizona State Museum you can see evidence of these massive mammals. Not only can you see mammoth bones, but if you look closely you can spot spear tips embedded in the bones, evidence of being hunted by early man. Through the study of these, archeologists gain important insight into both the animals and humans who once inhabited these lands. … » Read more » Posted in Exhibits, Museum Experiences, Objects and their Stories, People | Tagged anthropology, archaeology, Arizona State Museum, Columbian mammoth, Dr. Emil Haury, mammoth, Naco, Objects and their Stories, Paleo-Indian Clovis The Changing Role of Basketry in Native Life Posted by falk on 03/18/2014 Today’s blog post was written by ethnological collections curator Diane Dittemore.

Among virtually all of the indigenous people of North America, baskets have been indispensable for a wide range of purposes: gathering, cooking, serving, carrying and other household and ritual functions. After European contact, basketry was gradually replaced by manufactured goods for many of these uses. This process accelerated toward the end of the 1800s. … » Read more » Posted in Exhibits, Objects and their Stories | Tagged anthropology, Arizona State Museum, Basketry Treasured, baskets, cultural preservation, Loretta Saraficio, Native American baskets, Pearl Kootswatewa, Save America's Treasures Early Arizona State Museum Donors and Collectors Posted by ASMedu on 03/14/2014 Today’s blog post was written by ethnological collections curator Diane Dittemore.
