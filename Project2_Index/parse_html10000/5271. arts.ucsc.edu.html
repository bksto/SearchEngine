UC Santa Cruz Alumnus Tom Franco Collaborates with Art Growing up in Palo Alto, CA into a gifted artistic family, it seems natural that Tom Franco would want to pursue a career in art. Both of his parents studied art at Stanford University; his mother, Betsy Franco, is a well-known author of teen and young adult books, and both of his brothers, James Franco and Dave Franco, are famous actors. “We did art projects with my mom,” says Tom. “My parents never told us what to do or how to do it. There were always creative things going on.”   UC Santa Cruz Students Compete in Global Challenge for $1 Million Hult Prize Professor of Music Amy Beal's Book About Composer Johanna Beyer Just Published
