He is best known for his willow wood and cottonwood mask carvings. Using traditional tools, he creates masks used in Yaqui Easter ceremonies. Carved Pascola masks are painted black and decorated with white, red and blue designs. Horsehair is used to fashion beards and eyebrows. His work is often marked with his own personal signature, a painted lizard. The museum store regularly carries Valenzuela’s masks, as well as a selection of Yaqui masks made by carvers from the Yaqui homeland in northern Sonora. Prices range from $50–$250. Hand coiled, hand painted traditional Laguna Pueblo pot made by Marquis Dann-Lente. As with this pot, the museum store specializes in carrying authentic Native American pottery made with traditional construction methods and designs. Pottery carried by the museum store ranges from $20–$3000. Hopi Coil Basket (Plaque) with Polik Mana Katsina image. Many people are familiar with carved representations of katsinam, but images of the beneficent supernatural messengers also appear on Hopi pottery, paintings, and basketry. For centuries, basketry has played an important role in Hopi life. Hopi women (and now, some men) continue to produce a wide variety of baskets for everyday use as well as ceremonial purposes. Second Mesa produces coiled baskets; Third Mesa is known for wicker. Weavers from all mesas plait sifter baskets. Non-Native interest in Hopi material created a strong market and since the late 1800s, baskets have also been made for the tourist and collector markets. Katsina imagery enhanced their marketability and thus their monetary value. The museum store carries basketry from many different cultures of the Southwest including Tohono O’odham, Navajo, Hopi, and Seri. Prices range from $30–$2500. Crazy Rattle Katsina doll Hopi katsina dolls, and the dancers on which they are based, are the physical manifestations of the katsina spirits.  The museum store carries many different katsina dolls, prices range from $150–$1000.
