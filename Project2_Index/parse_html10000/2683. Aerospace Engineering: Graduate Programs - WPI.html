Worcester Polytechnic Institute About WPI Academics Admissions Research Campus Life Athletics Skip to Additional Navigation Home  > Academics > Departments, Programs & Initiatives > Aerospace Engineering > Graduate Programs Graduate Programs Outstanding undergraduate students at WPI are eligible to pursue a combined bachelor of science and either a master of science or master of engineering degree in Aerospace Engineering by double-counting certain courses for both degrees. This accelerated course of study allows students to obtain a master’s degree in only five years of full-time work. Advisors and graduate coordinators in the department consult with students to determine the specific courses and MQP (Major Qualifying Project) requirements needed for the BS/MS program. The courses and project work are determined on an individual basis to match particular academic pursuits and career goals. Students are encouraged to plan this curriculum early in their undergraduate career in order to fulfill the requirements of both degrees. To learn more about this program option, see our WPI Graduate Catalog.   Request Info Apply Academics Aerospace Engineering About the Program Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs MS Program PhD Program Courses Faculty Research Facilities News & Events Student Projects Potential Careers Related Sites Mechanical Engineering Materials Engineering ECE RBE Engineering at WPI Career Opportunities at WPI Contact Aerospace Engineering 250 Higgins Laboratories 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5221 Fax: +1-508-831-5680 aerospace@wpi.edu Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
