Simply choose a course and register. For certificate requirements and instructions, select the certificate you are interested in from the list above, then see the Earning the Certificate section on that page. What does a certificate cost? Tuition for each course, which must be taken for graduate credit, is about $2,200. The exact tuition is listed in each course description. Is financial aid available? If you are not an admitted Extension School degree candidate, you are not eligible for federal or state aid. However, you may be eligible for scholarship funds, including Lowell Scholarships for Boston-area middle and high school teachers, community scholarships, and private student loans. I am an international student. Can I come to campus? Because our certificates are part time, non-degree offerings, I-20 certificates for the F-1 student visa are not available for on-campus study.  You would complete the certificate by taking online courses. Can I earn a certificate online? Several certificates can be completed online. Because some course instructors prefer to meet face-to-face, not every course applicable to a certificate has an online option. How do certificates differ from degrees? Our Extension School graduate degrees require 10 to 12 courses, specific admission requirements, and a formal application process. With only three to five courses, no admissions requirements, and no applications, certificates offer a quicker path to a professional development credential. Certificate awardees do not participate in Commencement or receive alumni status. What will my certificate say? The certificate will state: Harvard University, Harvard Extension School awarded [Your Name] a [three-, four-, or five-] course professional graduate-level certificate in [field name]. Will all the courses listed be offered every year? The required courses are offered, but the elective offerings do change slightly from year to year due to instructor availability and new offerings. Can I count one course toward multiple certificates? No, each certificate requires three, four, or five distinct courses to ensure its academic and professional value. Can I count a certificate toward a Harvard Extension School degree program? Our certificates are standalone credentials, but you can count one certificate toward one degree. Also, our degrees have specific admission, GPA, grade, course, and timeline requirements. You’ll want to do your research by reviewing the program requirements and use the degree course search to see how certificate courses count toward each program.
