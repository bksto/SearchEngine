Scheduling Campus Visits Campus visits are a great opportunity for prospective students to walk the Santa Barbara campus and learn about academics, student life and making the transition from high school or community college to UCSB. Campus visits are scheduled through the UCSB Visitor Center's event calendar. The Visitor Center is closed for all administrative closures and university holidays. All available visit options are listed. If a date or time is not listed, it is unavailable. All dates include a presentation and tour, unless otherwise noted. Note for visitors: As of January 2014 all UC campuses, including UCSB, are smoke-free and tobacco-free. For more information on the policy please visit the campus website.

To schedule a visit for a school or community group of 20 or more, click the button below to make a visit reservation. Group visits usually consist of an admission presentation and a guided campus tour. However, we are able to offer only the presentation at times when our tour guides are not available. School and community groups are encouraged to plan ahead and register early for a campus visit. When the presentation and tour times have been reserved for a particular date, no additional groups will be hosted and that date will no longer appear as an option on the calendar. ​School or community groups (groups of 20 or more) Although we prioritize groups consisting of middle school, high school and community college students, we can sometimes accommodate elementary school students for a campus tour though we do not offer presentations to this age group. For assistance with this or other visit-related matters, contact the Campus Visit Coordinator at (805) 893-3331. Getting to UCSB The Visitor Center is located adjacent to the Mesa Parking Structure 18 on the ground floor of the Student Affairs Administrative Services Building (SAASB). For directions and parking information, visit the Maps and Directions page. I loved my tour of UCSB. We came all the way out here from Connecticut and I definitely was not disappointed. It really was a special day. - Alexandra G., prospective student Contact & Connect Terms of Use Office of Admissions 1210 Cheadle Hall University of California, Santa Barbara Santa Barbara, CA 93106-2014 Copyright © The Regents of the University of California All Rights Reserved.
