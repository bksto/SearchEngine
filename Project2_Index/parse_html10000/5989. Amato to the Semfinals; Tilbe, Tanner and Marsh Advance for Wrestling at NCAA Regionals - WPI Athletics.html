Nigro won his first round bout with Ben Swanson of Norwich 4-2 at 149 pounds while Pizzuto claimed a first period pin of Bridgewater State's Shahib Blount in consolation four at 197 pounds.  Also competing for WPI at regionals were Stephen Jendritz (Rockford, MI) at 133, Tanner Burke (Derry, NH) at 157, Lucas Muntz (West Hartford, CT) at 184 and Teddy Kostopoulos (Devon, CT) at heavyweight.  On the day WPI amassed 21.5 points and sits in 12th place.  Williams enjoys a slight edge in the team race.  The Ephs totaled 66.5 points Saturday but have three other teams within  4.5 points or closer.  Action on Sunday begins at 10am.
