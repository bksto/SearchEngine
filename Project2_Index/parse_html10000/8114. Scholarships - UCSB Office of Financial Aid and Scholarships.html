Thank You Donors! Scholarships provide critical support to the success of students at UCSB. Due to the generous support of donors, students have received over $2.2 million in scholarships. On behalf of the many students who have received support from scholarships, we would like to extend a special thank you to our generous donors! The following list includes a variety of resources for scholarships, including University scholarships as well as scholarships from outside agencies: Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships Awards All students that submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year by the March 2 priority deadline are considered for scholarship support. There is no other application that needs to be submitted. Because of limited funds, almost all scholarships, including restricted scholarships (e.g.: specific backgrounds, academic interests, career objectives, etc.), are awarded to continuing students that have done very well academically at UCSB. Additionally, all scholarships administered by the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships are awarded on the basis of need. None are awarded solely on the basis of merit. New students tell us about their criteria that might meet specific restricted scholarship requirements when they complete the “Scholarship Opportunities” section in Step 2 of the online admissions application or the equivalent section of the paper admissions application. During that process, they are asked to review a list of eligibility characteristics and check off those that apply to them. These characteristics remain part of the students’ financial aid application records for future years’ scholarship consideration. Financial Aid applicants are reviewed for scholarship eligibility at the time their other aid eligibility is determined; thus, scholarship eligibility will be posted on their Financial Aid Award Letter along with other aid for which they qualify. All awards are subject to the availability of funding. Regents Scholarship The Regents Scholars selection committee conducts a comprehensive review of the applicant pool to determine the student’s strength and breadth of academic preparation. Selection is based on a thorough review of the admissions application, including, but not limited to, test scores and grades. To be eligible for the Regents Scholarship, you must be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident, a non-citizen student qualifying under California Assembly Bills 130 or 131, or an international student with outstanding academic qualifications. Only students who fall under these categories are eligible for the Regents Scholarship. Regents Scholarship decisions are mailed in mid-February each year. All decisions are final; appeals are not considered for Regents Scholarship decisions. The Regents Scholarship is a prestigious award for incoming freshman whose UC application shows outstanding academic achievement. Visit the Admissions website for more information. Departmental Scholarships The University of California, Santa Barbara has a variety of scholarship opportunities. While many scholarships are administered by our office, some are available through other campus departments. For some programs, there is no application process, and the recipients are selected on the basis of criteria already available to the university.
