Admissions Interns are all former tour guides who have chosen to take their involvement with the Admissions Office to the next level. All interns are selected among a highly competitive applicant pool, and they are well trained to answer questions about WPI. But because they are current students, they are some of the best individuals to give you a glimpse of what it's really like to be a WPI student! You may encounter interns in our office hanging out, co-presenting one of our information sessions, offering personal interviews, or just roaming around campus. We encourage you to get to know the interns below and contact them with any questions you may have.
