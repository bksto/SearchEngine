Sacramento State defeated San Jose State, 5-0, in the afternoon, before falling to Cal, 4-1, later in the evening. With the split, the Hornets conclude the season with a 3-9 record. However, after Sacramento State co-head coaches Ruben Volta and Jason Borchin changed four of the team's five doubles lineups, the Hornets went 3-3 over their final six matches. Of Sacramento State's 12 contests this season, six were decided by 3-2 scores and the Hornets were 2-4 in those outcomes. In today's victory over San Jose State, the Hornets' No. 1 team of Kayla Beal and Katie Aprile (13-21, 21-19, 15-11), No. 2 Madeline Cannon / Sloan Lovett (23-21, 21-14), No. 3 Lauren Aikels / Chelcy Motes (21-16, 21-23, 20-18), No. 4 Morgan Stanley / Kendall LaVine (9-21, 21-14, 16-14) and No. 5 Lexie Skalbeck / Courtney Dietrich (forfeit) were each victorious. Against Cal, who the Hornets have now played five times since the beginning of last season, Stanley and LaVine won their match by a 21-18, 16-21, 15-7 score. Sacramento State is now 3-2 all-time against Cal, and today marked the first time a match between the two teams wasn't decided by a 3-2 score. Below are today's complete results and the final records of the Hornets' five doubles teams. The tandem of Aprile/Beal have remained the same all season, while the other four lineups were switched six matches ago. Final Doubles Records 1. Kayla Beal/Katie Aprile:  6-6 2.
