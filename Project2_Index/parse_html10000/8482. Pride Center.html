Student Life University of Redlands > Student Life > Campus Diversity & Inclusion > The Centers > Pride Center Pride Center The Pride was opened in 2005 after students campaigned for funding from the University for a safe space for people who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or allies and for those that wanted to have a resource on campus for exploring such topics. The Pride Center serves as the meeting space for student groups and host speakers, discussion groups and community events. Some of the events we help put on are: National Coming Out Week Drag Ball Pride Week National Day of Silence Transgender Day of Remembrance  Lavender Recognition Ceremony The Pride Center also has a great library of books and resources for and about the LGBTQA community. For more questions, drop in and say hello or contact Sarah Vilardo.   Student clubs and organizations that operate out of the PRIDE Center include: People Representing Individuality, Diversity, & Equality (PRIDE) Alliance – provides a safe and supportive atmosphere for all students who are looking to explore and/or define their sexual identity through social and political activity Safe Space Allies– seeks to encourage acceptance and appreciation of GLBT members of the community by providing Ally training and awareness campaigns Pride Center Mission Statement Programs and Activities See Also LGBTQ Programs Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: Campus Diversity & Inclusion Upcoming Events Programs About CDI The Centers Multicultural Center Women's Center Pride Center International Student Services Native American Student Programs Professional Development Community Service Learning Dining on Campus Disability Services Residence Life & Housing Student Academic Support Student Activities & Organizations Student Conduct The Counseling Center Student Health Services Returning from a Leave of Absence Zipcar at Redlands Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories Casavant Pipe Organ The 83-year-old instrument was fully restored in 2003 and features 4,266 pipes.
