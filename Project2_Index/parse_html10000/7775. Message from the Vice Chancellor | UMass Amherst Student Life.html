As student affairs professionals, our work is based on the philosophy of student development. This means we build a total educational environment that integrates students’ learning in and outside the classroom. We respond to students as unique individuals. We develop students by responding to their needs in intellectual, emotional, social, cultural, spiritual, physical, and occupational dimensions. We create a supportive and challenging campus environment that enhances students’ personal and social growth, and helps develop personal resources needed to succeed in college and beyond. We are in the business of transforming students’ potential where: Critical Thinking is increased; Knowledge is expanded; Multi-cultural awareness and competency are developed; Inter and intrapersonal competence is gained; and Practical life skills are acquired. We believe in engaging our students in their educational journey because we know that students’ educational success is increased when they are active participants in the learning process. Involving every student in a meaningful way to learn and develop themselves and/or connecting students to positive role models paves the road for a transformational collegiate experience. We develop partnerships with Academic Affairs and with the surrounding community to create a campus culture that supports student success leading to increased retention rates, higher graduation rates, and better academic experience for all students. We look forward to meeting and working with you! Enku Gelaye Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Campus Life Whitmore Admin.
