College of Business Administration COBA is committed to providing rigorous and relevant educational programs that reflect a balance of theoretical and applied learning. This is achieved through collaborative relationships between faculty, staff, students and the community. College of Education, Health and Human Services The Schools and Departments in the College focus on student centered education that prepares learners to join their chosen fields as dedicated and dynamic professionals. The college brings together excellent teacher preparation and nursing programs with vibrant undergraduate programs in Kinesiology and Human Development. College of Humanities, Arts, Behavioral & Social Sciences The new College of Humanities, Arts, Behavioral and Social Sciences (CHABSS) is home to several core disciplines in the arts, humanities, and social and behavioral sciences, and many interdisciplinary programs. Nearly every CSUSM undergraduate takes courses in the College in degree programs or in General Education courses. We currently offer 17 Bachelor of Arts (BA), 5 Master of Arts (MA) degree programs, and 28 minors. The College contributes richly to CSUSM’s General Education program, which serves all undergraduate students with coursework designed to develop broad basic knowledge and valuable skills. College of Science & Mathematics We provide our students with the foundational knowledge and skills needed to meet technological challenges in a rapidly evolving world. It is an exciting time to be a STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) student at CSUSM. The Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development has designated our region as an innovation hub for life sciences and technology. The National Science Foundation estimates that 80 percent of jobs created in this decade will require math and science skills, and we are designing our curricula to be responsive to the needs of quality STEM education. © Copyright 2012 California State University San Marcos.
