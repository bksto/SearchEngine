The digital images are available to students and faculty through our online database.  The still images are available only to faculty for classroom use and the videos can be checked out by students and faculty. Image Request Policy: Requests for new images (digital images and dvd's) are taken throughout the semester. Primary consideration will be given to image requests for current class instruction. Image Circulation Policy: Digital images may be accessed at any time through the online database and slides may be assembled at any time in the College’s VR slide sorting room. Slides are checked out the day of the class lecture and returned immediately after. Videos for use in a class may be checked out for a week. All other video checkouts are overnight only. Collection Development Initatives: In addition to the procedures in place for collection improvement and development, a special digital media initiative is in progress:  The Houston Collection.  The Houston Collection is a collection of images that will reflect the built, unbuilt and demolished environment of the Houston region.  One goal is to build a complete history of each site and, when possible to add a current photo to the historical images. Staffing: The visual resource teaching collections are administered by one fulltime curator and graduate research assistants. The role of the Curator and Collection Staff is to improve and preserve the teaching collection of images and assist in integrating the images into the architectural curriculum. AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT is available from the Computer Laboratory, Room 301. A 24-hour advance reservation is required. COPYPHOTOGRAPHY STAND is available for use in the William R. Jenkins Architecture & Art Library. No camera is provided.
