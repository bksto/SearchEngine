So much so, in fact, that he was awarded the 2009 Frank Serrao Student Athlete of the Year. The prestigious award is given annually to the top male and female student athletes who best exemplify strong academic and athletic success at the University of Redlands. In addition to his well-deserved Student Athlete of the Year recognition, Ross Schunk has earned the honor of being the most prolific scorer in University of Redlands history–and we mean that in the most honorable way. For example, this Bulldog student athlete not only set the career program record for number of goals (63), but also for highest points scored (139), and number of games played (90). He did it all while earning three First-Team All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) Honors, two SCIAC Player of the Year Awards, three National Soccer Coaches Association of American (NSCAA)/adidas® All-Far West Region awards, two NSCAA/adidas® All-American nominations and many other coveted accolades. All of this set the stage for the Redlands athlete’s pivotal moment when the dream of playing professional ball became a real invitation to play in front of top Major League scouts during the 2009 MLS Combine. No other NCAA Division III student athlete received such an invitation. Ross’ performance at the MLS combine ultimately led to a phone call from the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer during the 2009 SuperDraft. The Rapids wanted him on their team. Redlands head coach of men’s soccer, Ralph Perez, said Ross’ outstanding achievement also benefits the school. “Ross has been a great ambassador for Division III, but more importantly, he’s been a great ambassador for the University of Redlands.”  Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: All News Redlands in the News News Releases Och Tamale A Legacy of Leadership SmartAdvice Search News Profiles Tara Johnson '12 Johnson Kosgei '09 Bill Butler '08 Angel Blue '05 Danny O'Brien '86 Rick West '65 Chris Depew '13 Ross Schunk, Bulldog athlete Bob Miller '04 Brian & Sarah Cain '09 Ollie Ivy '11 Gary Byrne '64 James Stewart '11 Ruben Gonzalez '13 Violet Miehle ‘15 Dorothy Catanese ‘12 Amanda Baker ‘12 Richard Blair '42 Jordan Castellanos '16 Sarah Emoto '11 Brian Nuño '11 John Townsend '54 Ed Vance '56 Krista-Nicole Bishop '12 Waldo Buitrago '12 Tiffany Eggleston '12 Traci English '10 Debbie Eytchison '07 '10 Ryan Gallagher '00 Rashid Ghazi '89 Andrew Smaltz '00 & Lindsay Gunderlock-Smaltz '00 Julie Lamoureux '10 '12 Jean Stephens ’81 Larry Walker '10 Eric Zornes ‘11 Steffany Ellis '11 Susan Levine EdD Paula Merrick '76 Koby Rodriguez '08, '11 Erick Witherspoon Inauguration of President Ralph Kuncl Kelly Rogers '13 Shanice McKinley '10 Faculty Experts $2,600 Success Scholarship Celebrating the Class of 2014 Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories Cogeneration Plant The state-of-the-art power facility enables the University to produce a majority of its own energy and has reduced the campus’s carbon footprint by 33 percent.
