The NRS draws investigators for many reasons. The reserve network reflects California's diverse ecosystems at sites located across seven degrees of latitude. Reserve lands are protected for the long term, enabling researchers to conduct experiments without fear of the land or their equipment being disturbed. Data archives enable scientists to build on decades of previous research. Overnight accommodations, laboratories, Internet access, and other amenities make fieldwork more comfortable and productive. Research Using Multiple Reserves NRS reserves span a north-to-south distance of 600 miles, and an east-to-west distance of 300 miles. The vast reach of the system enables researchers to compare species and conditions in one portion of the state with those of another, at a spatial magnitude relevant to entire ecosystems. For this reason, a number of major research projects involve transects featuring multiple NRS reserves. Institute for the Study of Ecological Effects of Climate Impactjs • ISEECI A platform for synthesizing past, current and future environmental change research, and for understanding and potentially mitigating future climate impacts, leveraging the UC Natural Reserve System as a biologically and geographically diverse laboratory; 24 reserves. California Phenology Project A project tracking the dates of life stage events (leaf out, flowering, etc.) in selected native plant species to observe the impact of climate change on natural communities; more than 100 sites monitored at eight reserves. NRS Climate Monitoring Network Replicate, high-precision climate station equipment using identical data collection protocols provides data to reserve users; 26 stations at 22 reserves. Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans • PISCO Large-scale, integrated studies of the coastal ocean, rocky intertidal, and kelp forest ecosystems of the U.S. West Coast designed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of how these systems function; seven reserves. KelpWatch Sampling marine algae off the U.S. West Coast to monitor radiation leaked from nuclear reactors in Fukushima, Japan after a major earthquake in 2011; five reserves. Research Projects of National Significance Large national research projects are addressing many of today's global environmental problems call for. NRS reserves are part of several major national efforts to understand basic physical and ecological processes that govern the functioning of the environment. Critical Zone Observatories • CZOs Critical Zone Observatories study the outer skin of Earth, a layer that extends from the bottom of groundwater basins to the treetops and is essential to aquatic and terrestrial life. Angelo Coast Range Reserve is part of the Eel River Observatory, one of nine National Science Foundation-funded CZO sites in the United States. Long-Term Ecological Research Network • LTER The Long Term Ecological Research Network was created by the National Science Foundation in 1980 to research ecological issues that can last decades and span huge geographical areas. The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER, one of 27 sites in the network, studies how land and ocean processes structure giant kelp forest ecosystems. Santa Cruz Island, Coal Oil Point, Carpinteria Salt Marsh, and Scripps Coastal reserves all supply SBC LTER data. USDA Forest Service Experimental Forests Experimental forests provide places for long-term science and management studies in major vegetation types. The NRS's Sagehen Creek Field Station, part of the Sagehen Experimental Forest, is the site of a pilot project to improve forest habitat while reducing wildfire fuel loads.
