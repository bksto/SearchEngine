How the Fund Has Made a Difference The gifts to the UCR Fund from thousands of alumni, parents and friends have helped UCR: Attract and retain the nation’s brightest students through scholarship and fellowship support. Recruit world-class faculty in each department. Create new and innovative programs and curricula. Renovate classrooms and laboratories, and equip them with the necessary equipment and supplies to maximize our students' learning experiences. Renew subscriptions to scholarly journals and keep our libraries up to date with the information our students need to support their educational experience. Provide support for UCR Intercollegiate Athletics, the UCR Botanic Gardens and other programs and projects. Chancellor's Associates Donors who contribute $2,000 or more annually to any school, college, program or department are invited to become members of The Chancellor’s Associates. These loyal supporters want to make a difference at UCR — and they do. Chancellor’s Associate members provide the backbone of critical private support that makes UCR a leader for positive developments in our community, our region and beyond. Their gifts make a profound difference in the lives of countless people locally and around the world who benefit from the UCR’s teaching, research and public service programs.

The UCR Telefund The UCR Telefund is an integral part of the annual giving program. Student callers connect with alumni, parents and friends nationwide to keep them informed of UCR news and events. Students also share with our constituencies the importance of private support and giving back to UCR. Meet members of the UCR Telefund team.
