If the web form cannot be accessed for any reason, you can send your request to the department email address which is: printshop@chaffey.edu. You must include all required information and job specifications in the email to prevent delays in printing. Please include a phone number where you can be contacted with any clarifications about your request. Also, be sure to check your email for replies from us regarding questions or problems with your job. When sending multiple jobs in a single email, files will be printed separately unless stated otherwise. Note: Some files (especially large ones) may not come over correctly attached to the web form. Power Points files can be a problem. In that case, the web form can be filled out and you can attached the file to a regular email and send it to: printshop@chaffey.edu.

(If you use regular email in lieu of the web form, you must include the same information that is on the paper requisition.) The following information is necessary to process your order promptly and efficiently: Full Name School AND Department (what you teach, such as math or sociology) Extension or phone number where you can be reached in case clarification is needed to complete your job. Mark ALL appropriate boxes in the job specifications section. DUE DATE IS IMPORTANT FOR JOB SCHEDULING! “Deliver to” means delivery location (not your name) such as your building and room number. If you are going to pick up your job, just write Pick Up in that space. OTHER TIPS AND HELPFUL INFORMATION In an effort to be "environmentally friendly" and to cut paper costs, a two-sided policy has been implemented for sequential documents other than tests. Please explain any circumstances that require one sided copies. If the one-sided or two-sided box is not marked, it will be printed two-sided! When sending tests online, be sure to delete answer keys in the document or state in the special instructions to omit them when printing. THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHEN THE INSTRUCTOR WANTS THEM ATTACHED FOR A STUDY GUIDE, SO BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE SO YOUR DOCUMENT IS PRINTED CORRECTLY. When emailing extremely important documents, it’s always wise to have a backup copy on a flash drive or hard copy with you in case there is a problem. COMPUTERS ARE NOT FAIL-PROOF! Things DO go wrong occasionally. Get familiar with the copyright rules for educational use by reading the booklet included in your faculty handbook. There is also a link to a PDF file on-line.
