LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) Gold certification is awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). The team of Lentz Morrissey Architecture and Tilden-Coil Constructors, Inc. worked with the University on the green features of the Center project recognized, which include:  More than 77 percent of the wood-based building materials were harvested from Forest Stewardship Council certified forests. Energy-efficiency measures including an improved thermal envelope, high-efficiency glazing, reduced-lighting power density, and occupancy sensors. All indoor adhesive and sealant products, and all indoor paint and coating products comply with the Volatile Organic Compounds emission standards. Management of construction waste including diverting from landfills 1,738.97 tons (or 96 percent) of on-site generated construction waste. Use of recycled content in the project including 32 percent of the total building materials content being manufactured using recycled materials. Water-use reduction measures including reducing potable water use by 42.7 percent from a calculated baseline used to determine exemplary performance by USGBC standards. The Center, which is home to the Art and Art History departments, Ann Peppers Hall and the Theatre Arts Department facilities, is the second LEED-certified building on campus. Lewis Hall, the one-story, earth-sheltered 14,484-square-foot “green” building, is a LEED Silver certified building.
