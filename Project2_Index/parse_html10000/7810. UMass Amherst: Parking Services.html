News March 6-8 Campus Wide Parking Restrictions Last year, thousands of students from other campuses came to the town of Amherst during the first weekend in March. This event became known as ?Blarney Blowout.? Many of these out-of-town visitors stayed in our residence halls and utilized our parking lots as staging areas. The ensuing large scale disturbance resulted in personal injuries, destruction of property, arrests, and numerous student discipline cases. The lasting impact of this disturbance and recommendations for responding to this type of incident was outlined in the Davis Report - http://bit.ly/196BIgz. This year we are limiting access to our campus in the residence halls and parking lots. Consistent with the changes to the residence hall guest policy for the weekend of March 6-8, please note that all campus parking lots will be restricted to valid UMass Amherst permit holders from Friday, March 6 at 5 PM through Sunday, March 8 at 5 PM. During these dates, all campus parking lots will be considered 24 hour restricted lots. Vehicles parking on campus without a valid UMass Amherst parking permit are subject to ticketing and/or towing. Faculty, students and staff who do not have a UMass Amherst parking permit and need to park on campus for work during this restricted period may call Parking Services at 413-577-PARK for additional information.
