Recognizing a Potential Threat Violence prevention relies on having effective resources available, excellent communication between service administrators and community members, and the ability to recognize, report and respond to a potential threat. It is recognized that each individual has the ability to prevent violence on campus through recognizing and reporting a potential threat. Trusting Your Intuition (Your "Uh Oh!" Feeling) Warning Signs Understanding How a Threat Develops Color Chart of Threat Escalation MultiMedia Resources How to Respond Students | Faculty/Staff | Postdocs Trusting Your Intuition It's always a good habit to trust your intution especially when dealing with a potentially threatening situation. Listening to your "uh oh" feeling and reporting a person or situation that is of concern to you is extemely important and critical to violence prevention. It is natural to rationalize or deny that a concern or threat may exist. We ask that you overcome that by considering the following: You may only be aware of one piece of the puzzle. You may not be aware of a person's history. Coming forward and contacting a resource that you feel comfortable with may be critical for bringing awareness to a potential threat. Information that you feel is not worthy of attention may in fact be critical information for others to recognize a pattern or potential threat. This is because threat assessment professionals rely on gathering as much information as possible oftentimes from a variety of sources and use this information to create an assessment of potential violence. Warning Signs There are several indicators of a potential threat which, taken by themselves, may not be immediately obvious. Nevertheless, you may only be seeing part of what is going on and so it's very important to tell a supervisor or campus resource person any cause for concern that you may have. If you recognize any of these warning signs, you are encouraged to notify someone immediately about your concerns. A variety of resources are available here: Students | Faculty & Staff | Postdocs Warning signs can manifest themselves in many forms: one-on-one settings, group interaction, public behavior, letters, emails, blogs, websites, social networking sites, photos, phone calls, text messages, etc. The following list of warning signs is not intended to be fully comprehensive.
