Wendell Stanley (1904–1971) shared the 1946 Nobel Prize in chemistry for contributions to the preparation of enzymes and virus proteins in pure form. Stanley received two U of I degrees: a Master of Science (1927) and a Ph.D. (1929). Rosalyn Sussman Yalow (1921–2011) shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for the discovery and development of radioimmunoassay, a technique that employs radioactive isotopes to detect and measure the levels of insulin and hormones in the blood and in body tissues. Yalow was the second woman to win the Nobel Prize in medicine.Yalow holds two U of I degrees: a Master of Science (1942) and a Ph.D. (1945). Faculty John Bardeen (1908–1991) won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 and 1972, the only person to have won the physics prize twice. He shared the 1956 prize with W. H. Brattain and W. Shockley for research on semiconductors and the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs, and the 1972 prize with L. N. Cooper and J. R. Schrieffer for the theory of superconductivity, developed at the U of I. Bardeen served on the University’s faculty from 1951 until his death in 1991. Leon N Cooper (1930– ) shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physics with faculty member John Bardeen and alumnus John R. Schreiffer for their development of the theory of superconductivity, usually called the BCS-theory. He was a research associate at the U of I from 1955 to 1957. Elias Corey (1928– ) won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1990 for his “development of the theory and methodology of organic synthesis.” Corey served on the faculty in the Department of Chemistry at the University from 1951 to 1959. Vincent Du Vigneaud (see listing under alumni) Murray Gell-Mann (1929– ) won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for "his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions." Gell-Mann was a postdoctoral research associate in 1951 and a visiting research professor from 1952-1953. Leonid Hurwicz (1917–2008) shared the Nobel Prize in economics in 2007 with Eric S. Maskin and Roger B. Myerson for "having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory." He served as a faculty member at the University of Illinois Department of Economics from 1949-1951. Hurwicz served as a faculty member at the University of Illinois Department of Economics from 1949-1951. Paul C. Lauterbur (1929–2007) shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2003 with Sir Peter Mansfield for "seminal discoveries concerning the use of magnetic resonance to visualize different structures." Lauterbur was among the first scientists to use nuclear magnetic resonance in the studies of molecules, solutions, and solids. Lauterbur joined the U of I faculty in 1985. Anthony J. Leggett (1938– ) shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in physics with Alexei A. Abrikosov and Vitaly L. Ginzburg for "pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids."

Eight faculty members and research scientists on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign served on the IPCC and were aknowledged by the organization for their contributions to the Nobel-earning work. Donald Wuebbles and Michael Schlesinger were recognized by special certificate by the IPCC for their leadership roles in the work.
