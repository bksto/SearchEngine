Malone The University of Massachusetts Amherst has emerged over the last decade as a world-class center for research and scholarship. The campus is classified as a Research University with Very High research activity (RU/VH) by the Carnegie Foundation. The success of our research programs reflect the faculty's innovative and interdisciplinary approach to research. This increases the relevance of research and creates new areas of study, many of them important to the social and economic vitality of the Commonwealth and the nation. As we enjoy success there is still much to do to advance the campus as a top public research institution. I am honored to have this opportunity to help faculty, students and staff grow their research programs and to further the campus's mutually beneficial engagement with public and private partners. _____________________________________________ The mission of the Office Research and Engagement is to provide leadership and services that support the growth of research and scholarship across the campus, to facilitate funding and engagement with external partners, to promote innovation and societal impact, and to ensure compliance with all research related regulations and policies.       Michael F.
