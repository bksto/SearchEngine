Phase III Unit Planning: Academic Year 2014-2015   In October of 2012, a Joint Task Force on Strategic Oversight (JTFSO) was charged to "make recommendations to the Chancellor with respect to a high-level Strategic Plan" to be submitted as part of the campus's fifth-year interim accreditation report of August 2013. The document that was produced, "Innovation and Impact: Renewing the Promise of the Public Research University," set an agenda for the campus and continues to serve as a guide for planning and implementation across the campus. During the 2013-2014 academic year, JTFSO built on the Phase I report by identifying initiatives that could be immediately or quickly implemented, and by fleshing out campus priorities and direction in order to create developmental plans to set the stage for unit planning in Phase III.  With campus goals and directions clarified, departments and administrative units have been asked to assess their progress with respect to the campus's goals and articulate the contributions they plan to make going forward. In the fall of 2014, the Schools, Colleges, and departments drafted plans for Part I: Destination of Choice, focusing on undergraduate education. During the spring of 2015, they will develop plans for graduate education and research for Part II: Investment of Choice.
