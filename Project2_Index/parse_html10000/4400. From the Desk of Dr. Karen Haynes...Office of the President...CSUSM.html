As a recipient of this national honor, CSUSM will be featured along with 82 other recipients in INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine’s November 2014 issue.  While I am very pleased we received this honor, I am not surprised. For the last decade, we have worked tirelessly to create a diverse and inclusive environment at Cal State San Marcos. Half of our student body self-identifies as being from an underrepresented student population. We have been successful at closing the achievement gap because our diversity initiatives help ensure student success and prepare them for a diverse working and civic environment. Diversity doesn’t just happen at CSUSM, diversity happens because we develop strategies, craft initiatives and develop partnerships that ensure diversity is part of everything we do.

Graduation parties are being planned, caps and gowns are being picked up, and the university is making its final preparations to mark the achievements of students. That was certainly the case at Cal State San Marcos … until the fires. As the final chairs were being put in place on Mangrum Field, and the commencement stage was being set, CSUSM was evacuated. The Cocos fires were encroaching, burning through the hillside and toward campus. We thankfully got all staff, students and administration off campus as the fires grew closer. Our emergency response team quickly gathered and set up a command post to monitor the situation. It was Wednesday, late afternoon.

It not only has special meaning for you but also for your extended family and friends who have supported you in your journey along the way. Canceling Commencement was not a decision we took lightly and we are saddened by the circumstances. Safety continues to be our first concern. Our thoughts are with those in our community that are being impacted by the wildfires and we thank our region’s first responders for their dedication and support. We will continue to keep you updated. April 16, 2014 A New Beat at CSUSM Can you feel that? There’s a new beat at Cal State San Marcos, and it’s courtesy of our new University Student Union (USU). Opened for the start of the Spring 2014 semester, we are officially celebrating the union’s opening over the next two weeks with a variety of activities and events, including the Grand Opening Celebration, which was held outside on a perfect Southern California day in our USU amphitheater. Hundreds of guests, from CSUSM students, staff and faculty to alumni and community supporters, gathered for a short program, where they heard how a student union has been part of the Cal State San Marcos Master Plan since 1992. But, as I said in my remarks, the real planning for today’s union began in 2006, and it took the foresight of my leadership team and plenty of input from students to get us where we are today — with an amazing space that has quickly become the heartbeat of campus.

Perhaps it has something to do with the new Student Union that opened just after the semester began. Or maybe it’s because our men’s basketball team won its first-ever Association of Independent Institutions (A.I.I.) Division I Conference Championship. Whatever the reason, there’s no denying that CSUSM is the campus to be on right now. I know this to be true because I have heard it repeatedly as I have met with various groups and delivered remarks across campus and in our community. January started with a lively Q&A session with Vivienne Bennett, chair of the Academic Senate, at the Academic Spring Assembly, where faculty gather to discuss the semester. I followed that with our annual Faculty and Staff Awards, a celebration of the best of our employees.  It’s always good energy and a good way to start the year.

This week not only marks the beginning of the spring 2014 semester, it also marks a significant time at Cal State San Marcos as we open our new University Student Union. Staff and administrators moved in over the holiday break, and the finishing touches are being in put in place, but the building’s opening has already leant new energy to our campus. I invite you to explore all of the Union’s offerings in person or online. (read more about "Welcome to Spring 2014") © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos. All rights reserved.
