Stanford research programs reflect the expertise, creativity and initiative of the faculty who set the research agenda. Stanford faculty have a long tradition of engaging with their colleagues and students within Stanford's seven schools and working across disciplines. There are more than 5,300 externally sponsored projects throughout the university, with the total budget for sponsored projects at $1.33 billion during 2014-15, including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC). Of these projects, the federal government sponsors approximately 82 percent, including SLAC. In addition, nearly $230 million in support comes from non-federal funding sources. National research programs with centers at Stanford: Departments of Plant Biology and Global Ecology of the Carnegie Institution for Science National Bureau of Economic Research Independent Laboratories, Centers and Institutes There are 18 independent laboratories, centers and institutes, accounting for about 10 percent of Stanford research and involving about 300 faculty members and 800 students. These institutes are in line with Stanford's longstanding tradition of the independent labs that bring researchers together to solve large problems, engaging faculty and their students in collaborations that range from international and economic studies to studies on the environment, energy and health.

Research at SLAC addresses questions in materials and energy science, biology, chemistry, particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, advanced accelerator development and other fields. Nearly 3,400 scientists worldwide use the lab’s facilities each year, and more than 1,000 scientific papers are published annually based on research at SLAC, earning Nobel prizes for six scientists. Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace The Hoover Institution, devoted to the study of domestic and international affairs, was founded in 1919 by Herbert Hoover, a member of Stanford’s Pioneer Class of 1895 and the 31st U.S. president. One of the first “think tanks” in the United States, the institution has more than 100 resident scholars/specialists.   This page last modified Jan 05, 2015.
