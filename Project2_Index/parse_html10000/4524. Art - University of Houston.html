This graduate-level graphic design seminar offered through the University of Houston School of Art encourages students to pursue advanced research in graphic design and critical theory. The students worked together with Professor of Art Sibylle Hagmann and DiverseWorks Associate Curator Rachel Cook to push the boundaries of design thinking and visual expression. Each student will give a presentation about their project and process, and each project will be on view in the DWOW gallery space.  UH Graphic Design Creates Book Machine The UH Graphic Design project, "Book Machine," at the recent Texas Contemporary Art Fair in Houston.
