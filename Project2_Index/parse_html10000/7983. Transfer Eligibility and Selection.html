When UCSB cannot admit all eligible applicants it uses standards to select students that are more competitive than the minimum requirements. These standards, which the university calls selection criteria, identify students who have demonstrated high academic achievement and the capacity to contribute to the intellectual vitality of the campus community. Additionally, visit the Selective Majors for Transfer page to find out more about selective majors at UCSB that have additional requirements for admission. Minimum Transfer Eligibility Requirements Requirements for admission are explained at the University of California Admissions page. Students must complete the following requirements for transfer admission, listed as items A and B below. Complete 60 semester or 90 quarter units of transferable college credit with a grade point average of at least 2.4 for California residents and at least 2.8 for nonresidents (no more than 14 semester or 21 quarter units may be taken Pass/Not Pass). Complete the following seven-course pattern requirement, earning a grade of C or better in each: Two courses in English composition. One course in mathematics beyond intermediate algebra, such as college algebra, precalculus or statistics. Four courses from among at least two of the following areas: Arts and humanities Behavioral and social sciences Biological and physical sciences In addition to this course pattern, students are encouraged to complete as much of the lower-division preparation for their intended major as possible. UCSB transfer applicants are required to apply to a specific major. Prospective applicants who have not identified a major are encouraged to take courses that meet general education requirements while researching majors and trying coursework in potential major subject areas. Students attending a California community college are advised to refer to the ASSIST website for major preparation and course articulation. Intercampus Transfers Students interested in transferring to UCSB from another UC campus must apply for admission to UCSB and go through the same process as any other transfer applicant. To be considered for admission to UCSB, you must leave/have left your previous UC campus in good academic standing or have cleared any bad standing.
