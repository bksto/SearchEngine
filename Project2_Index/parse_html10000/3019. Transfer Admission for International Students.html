Note: UC San Diego does not accept transfer credit from programs that are technical or vocational in nature. Residence for Tuition Purposes at UC San Diego The financial independence requirement makes it extremely difficult for most undergraduate students whose parents are not California residents to qualify for classification as a resident at the University of California. This includes students from community colleges and other post-secondary institutions within California. Transfer students who were classified as residents of California at their previous school should not assume that they will be classified as residents at UC San Diego.
