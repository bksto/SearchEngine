Investigating this dynamic, scientists have found evidence of a glitch in the brain’s higher-order decision-making circuitry that could eventually be targeted in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Read More February 27, 2015 First Detailed Microscopy Evidence of Bacteria at the Lower Size Limit of Life Scientists have captured the first detailed microscopy images of ultra-small bacteria that are believed to be about as small as life can get. The research was led by scientists from Berkeley Laboratory and UC Berkeley. Read More February 25, 2015 Study IDs key birds that host Lyme disease bacteria in California A new UC Berkeley-led study has found that birds are more important than previously recognized as hosts for Lyme disease-causing bacteria in California.  Read More February 24, 2015 New York’s preschool expansion tilts system toward better-off families Rather than extending access to new families, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s robust expansion of free preschool across New York City has instead drawn thousands of children from existing programs and aided better-off families who already enjoyed abundant preschool supply.

Read More February 16, 2015 The Invisible Comes to Light Laura Waller is working on computational imaging methods for quantitative phase microscopy, which enables one to map the shape and/or density of invisible samples in a non-invasive way.  Her group is developing simple experimental architectures and efficient post-processing algorithms for phase recovery, applied in a variety of scientific and industrial settings. Read More February 9, 2015 Cancer’s Disposal System: Target for a Cure? Andreas Martin has developed novel systems and strategies to screen for compounds that selectively inhibit protein turnover in the cell and may lead to new drugs against cancer.   Read More February 9, 2015 Electricity from biomass with carbon capture could make western U.S. carbon-negative Biomass conversion to electricity combined with new technologies for capturing and storing carbon, which should become viable within 35 years, could result in a carbon-negative power grid in the Western United States by 2050. Read More February 5, 2015 Study Reveals how Oxygen is like Kryptonite to Titanium UC Berkeley scientists have found the mechanism by which titanium, prized for its high strength-to-weight ratio and natural resistance to corrosion, becomes brittle with just a few extra atoms of oxygen.
