Â  MIP has been reorganized as a unit of the Data Services Department of Information Services & Technology. Please bear with us as we work to bring our website up to date. MIP is a collaborative effort at the University of California, Berkeley to coordinate the application of information technology in museums and other organized, non-book collections. MIP staff work with faculty, collections managers, and curators to develop data models, system architectures, and demonstration and production systems as bases for coordinated and integrated approaches to the application of information technology in museums and archives. MIP assists museums and archives to broaden access to primary academic collections and data by scholars, students and the public. Information | Services | Related | Projects | Collections | Contact
