And it's evident in the caliber of our libraries. They are not only reading reference rooms but also cutting-edge research centers. The newly renovated and reconceived Charles E. Young Research Library is more than just a repository of existing knowledge. It is now flush with idea labs, communal research pods and a host of other tools designed to promote and capture the exchange of information at every stage. It's a place that has to be experienced to be appreciated, and it is just one of 10 world-class libraries on campus.
