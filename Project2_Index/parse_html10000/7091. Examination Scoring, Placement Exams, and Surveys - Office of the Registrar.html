Currently, our office works with the following departments on campus to administer and process their placement exams and surveys: Chemistry Math French Italian Hebrew Russian Spanish German Chinese Japanese Engineering Sweetland Center for Writing Survey Services The Office of the Registrar is no longer providing survey work for new customers based on a decision by the Provost’s Office. New customers are encouraged to use Qualtrics, provided by the University of Michigan free of charge for creating and administering online surveys. If new paper surveys are required, we suggest finding a contractor outside of the University. Scantron Corporation provides these services for larger jobs. The Office of the Registrar does maintain survey services for existing customers who are making only minor modifications to existing surveys.
