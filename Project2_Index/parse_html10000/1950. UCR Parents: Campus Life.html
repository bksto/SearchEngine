What’s Happening at UCR? Calendars What day do classes begin next year? How long is winter break? When is homecoming? Enrollment deadlines are on our current year Academic Calendar. And our Events Calendar keeps you up to date on what’s happening on campus. Orientation Programs UCR's Highlander Orientation Program is mandatory for all incoming first-year students. It gives students the opportunity to enroll in fall classes, meet with an advisor, learn their way around campus, meet other students, and find out tips that will help them academically. And we invite parents to be a part of it, too. The Highlander Family Orientation (on Day 1 of the student orientation), provides you with the tools and information needed to assist in your student's transition to college life and academic success. Athletics The UC Riverside Intercollegiate Athletics Department has 17 sports competing at the NCAA Division I level in the Big West Conference. When our students aren't out cheering for one of our teams, they can take an aerobics class or work out at our 80,000-square-foot Student Recreation Center. Arts & Culture From concerts and theater to dance and art exhibits, UCR's creative spirit and energetic diversity have earned us a reputation across the region as a thriving arts community. We invite you to check out our Events Calendar and experience the arts at UCR for yourself! Clubs & Organizations Whether your student is interested in debating politics, environmental activism – or just throwing a Frisbee around – there’s a club or organization on campus that will bring him or her together with other like-minded students. With about 200 clubs and organizations, including fraternities and sororities, there are always lots of opportunities to get involved. Search our database of groups. Commencement Commencement is the culminating event of an academic career, a time for you and your child to celebrate with friends, family and peers.
