Students explore the great ideas of Western and Eastern heritage and encounter fundamentals of almost all other disciplines. The philosophy curriculum contributes toward a broad, general education in the liberal arts, the goal of which means a liberating of one's mind, to free oneself from conventional opinions of one's time and place. Religious Studies Religious Studies encompass the personal, cultural, and ultimate dimensions in life. Students are introduced to theistic and non-theistic religions and philosophies, East and West, and their distinctive world views' through cognitive and social emphases. Religion courses aim to enable students to discover basic structures or essential characteristics of human religious experience through critical observation and thought.
