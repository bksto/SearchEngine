University of Redlands > Academics > College of Arts & Sciences College of Arts & Sciences Top 10 Reasons Why Redlands 1. Credibility + Value Not only do we have a 100+ year history, we’re consistently ranked among the best universities in the nation. 2. Earning potential Our graduates’ starting and mid-career salaries (15+ years) rank in the top 30 nationally of liberal arts colleges, according to Payscale.com 3. See the world and make a difference in it Study abroad in your choice of 100+ destinations worldwide. 4. Financial assistance Everyone deserves the opportunity to earn a degree, and we’re here to support your dreams. In fact, more than half of our students receive financial aid. 5. Become whomever you want Choose from 40+ majors/programs or customize your own through the uniquely innovative Johnston Center, where vision and independence are honored. 6. Feel the pride of service Community service is in our DNA. Collectively, our students donated more than 100,000 hours last year. And it’s why we won the Presidential Award for community service—one of three top schools in the nation! 7. You’ll never be bored Our stunningly beautiful campus is within easy distance of snow skiing, hiking and climbing. Head south to the coast where some of the world’s best beaches await. Go east into Palm Springs and Joshua Tree. Or west into Los Angeles for big city culture. Redlands also offers 100+ social groups/clubs to join. As a member of NCAA Division III, our 20+ athletic teams compete in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC). 8. Smart and caring professors Our faculty is an important reason why Redlands has produced 15 Fulbright Scholars in the past six years.  Redlands was cited for the second time in five years, in 2013, as being one of the JW Fulbright "top producers" for the United States.  A distinction held by approximately 30 universities annually. In fact, Redlands was highlighted by The Chronicle of Higher Education for its high percentage of undergraduate Fulbright Scholars. Our low student-to-faculty ratio (14:1) and a close-knit culture of connection create a better learning environment. 9. Holistic learning Life happens all around you, and so does your education. We’re known for holistic learning in multiple settings: classes, internships, study abroad, May Term and community service. You’ll leave here transformed, well-rounded and able to thrive wherever you land. 10. We earn high marks of our own Redlands earns high grades from authorities on higher education. The Fiske Guide to Colleges calls Redlands “One of higher education’s best-kept secrets.” Plus, Redlands is ranked in the “Top 100 Universities” that deserve a second look according to Jay Matthews, Washington Post writer and author of Harvard Schmarvard. If you’re someone looking for unlimited opportunity in life, there’s a very good chance that Redlands is the place for you.   Programs of Study Undergraduate Accounting Art History Art Studio Asian Studies Astronomy Biology Biochemestry & Molecular Biology Business Administration Chemistry Communicative Disorders Computer Science Creative Writing Economics English Environmental Studies French German Government History Human-Animal Studies International Relations Johnston Center for Integrative Studies Latin American Studies Mathematics Modern Languages Music Philosophy Physical Education & Athletics Physics Prelaw Premed Public Policy Psychology Race & Ethnic Studies Religious Studies Sociology & Anthropology Spanish Theatre Women's & Gender Studies Graduate Communicative Disorders Music Geographic Information Systems Take Action Request Information Redlands in your area Meet the Office of Admissions How to Apply Apply Online Check the status of your application Information en español Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: College of Arts & Sciences Academic Calendar Office of the Dean About the College Undergraduate Studies Graduate Studies Liberal Arts Foundation Success Stories CAS Faculty Resources Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories Take Our Virtual Tour » Cogeneration Plant The state-of-the-art power facility enables the University to produce a majority of its own energy and has reduced the campus’s carbon footprint by 33 percent.
