Spatial Programs at the University of Redlands Space and place are part of human experience. We use spatial thinking to orient our bodies, navigate terrain, and envision objects. The vast majority of information and data in our world has a geographic component, and spatial factors affect every aspect of our lives. The University of Redlands is a spatially-infused institution. We use spatial reasoning to enhance our curriculum, research and operations. Geospatial technologies support our activities, but our focus is on how thinking spatially enriches our understanding of our world. The Master of Science in Geographic Information Systems Program is designed for professionals seeking to enhance their knowledge of analysis, management, and communication of geographic information. It combines the development of strong technical skills and in-depth understanding of geographic information science and theory. The Redlands Institute supports the University's mission of education, research, and community outreach. The Institute serves as a resource for departments and programs across the campus. Working with teams of students, faculty, staff and administrators, we apply GIScience expertise and technology support to a wide array of projects and educational experiences. Learning Spatially is a campus-wide initiative promoting spatial literacy as a foundational component of a liberal arts curriculum. This program is one outcome of Redlands' institutional dedication to spatial reasoning in programs, research and curriculum. LENS harnesses the integrative power of geography with technologies to help faculty and students visualize knowledge, solve problems, and understand relationships through a spatial lens. 1200 East Colton Ave, P.O.
