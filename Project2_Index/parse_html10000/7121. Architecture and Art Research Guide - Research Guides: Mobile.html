Login Register for service close Building Plans   How to locate building plans   When searching for architectural graphics on specific buildings in books:  Search for plans and other building graphics in books on the architect.  Locate books on a specific architect using the UH Libraries’ online catalog:  ﻿To refine your search: Click on Advanced Keyword in the Other Searches box. Enter the name of the architect in one of the empty fields.  If the building is sufficiently notable, you may search for it by name.  Farnsworth House, for example.  Change the Location to –UH Architecture and Art. Change the Sorted by menu to Relevance and Date.  When searching through hits, make sure you identify whether a book was published before or after your building was completed.     When searching for architectural graphics on specific buildings in articles:  Architectural journals are typically the best place to find plans, sections, elevations, etc.   Visit the Jenkins Architecture and Art Library’s website. Click on Avery Index under Research Tools:   (If accessing from outside the library, you will be asked for your last name and Cougarcard Number to identify you as a legitimate user.) Enter the last name of your architect in the first line.  Enter variations on the name of your building in the three fields of the second line.  (For example:  Vals Platz OR Thermal Bath Vals OR Hotel Theme)﻿     The database will return a list of article titles using your search terms Click on any title and look for the field titled “Physical Description.”  Each type of graphic included in that article will be listed.  For example, “details, elevations, models, photos., plans, sections, site plans, sketches.”  To determine whether the UH Libraries owns the journal that contains that article, click on the Find This Item black box near the top of the record.     This will open up another screen.  If UH owns an electronic copy of the journal, the screen is named Article Linker.  If not, it will open a screen named a Citation Linker.  The Article Linker will either take you directly to the online version of the journal or list multiple databases that contain that journal.  Select any that include the publication date of the article.  The Citation Linker translates between two software programs.  In this case it takes information from the Avery Index and gives it to the UH Libraries online catalog.   Finding books and journals owned by the University of Houston Libraries Note the location code when reading the catalog record for a journal title.  Most will be ARCH&ART/GENERAL COLL, which means they are in the general collection at the Architecture and Art Library located on the first floor of the College of Architecture.  Some, particularly those that focus on engineering, construction, and general history, may be ANDERSON/GENERAL COLL or ANDERSON/BOUND JOURNALS.  These will be located at the M.D. Anderson Library.  Please ask how to locate them at the Information Desk on the first floor of the M.D. Anderson Library.    Locating plans for new buildings: If your building was completed within the past three years, it may be difficult to locate published plans.  For recent buildings, contact the architecture firm that designed the building and ask them to email any plans to you.  Saving the plans: Almost all books may be borrowed by UH students and faculty.  Journals may not be borrowed, unless they are a duplicate copy.  The Architecture and Art Library collects duplicate copies of Architectural Record and Praxis only.   Photocopiers and a scanner are provided, so students may copy journal pages. The scanner is not online, however, so patrons must bring their own flash drive.  close MFAH Partnership   Welcome The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston has partnered with the UH Libraries and the UH School of Art to share resources and develop programming.  This page exists to help researchers at the MFAH and its affiliate campuses enroll in the partnership program.   Partners Museum of Fine Arts, Houston School of Art, University of Houston University Libraries, University of Houston   If you wish to borrow books and media...
