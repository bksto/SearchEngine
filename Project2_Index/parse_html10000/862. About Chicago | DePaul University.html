From its world-class architecture and thriving business district to its cultural institutions and the stunning beauty of Lake Michigan, DePaul students not only enjoy the fun and excitement of living in Chicago, they benefit from the multifaceted and multi-cultural community, and the many ways the city becomes an integral part of their educational experience. Architecture Chicago’s skyline is recognized around the world, and the city has been hailed the architecture capital of the United States. A favorite activity for tourists and locals alike is the famous Chicago Architecture River Cruise, which includes stunning views and fascinating information about architectural styles and the city’s rich history.  Theater and Music Chicago has long been known for theater, from big productions at landmark venues in Chicago’s downtown Theater District to experimental works at small storefront theaters in outlying neighborhoods. When it comes to music, you can find live performances of every kind every night of the week (although jazz and blues have a special place in the city’s cultural history).  Dining  Chicago takes food very seriously—not just its famous pizza and hot dogs, but everything else, too, from breakfast and contemporary dining to ethnic food found in Chinatown, Greektown and Little Italy. Saveur Magazine even dubbed Chicago “America’s new culinary star.” Lake Michigan Lake Michigan is located just a few blocks away from both our Lincoln Park and Loop campuses, making it easy for students to stroll the shoreline, play some volleyball, or bike or jog along scenic Lake Shore Drive. Sports Chicago is one of only three cities in the country with six professional teams: the Chicago Bears, Blackhawks, Bulls, Fire, Cubs and White Sox. Classic Wrigley Field, home of the Cubs, is a sight to see even if the Cubs aren't in town. It was the White Sox, though, who brought home the 2005 World Series Championship, and the Blackhawks, who won the Stanley Cup in both 2010 and 2013. Museums Learning throughout the city is easy, thanks to Chicago’s nearly 50 museums, including those dedicated to art, history, science and technology. From the Impressionist painting collection at the Art Institute to numerous interactive science exhibits at the Museum of Science and Industry to "Sue," the largest and best-preserved Tyrannosaurus rex fossil yet discovered at the Field Museum. Getting Around Chicago is a travel hub, which means it’s easy to get to from anywhere in the country or world. Once you’re in Chicago, there are many convenient options for getting around, from bike paths and L trains to buses and cabs.
