The mission of AHS is to promote health and wellness across the lifespan, and you will find this common thread throughout our curriculum, research, and engagement activities within the College. Our students gain invaluable experience through internships, research opportunities, honors options, career development and leadership programs, and student engagement opportunities. Our dynamic and world-renowned faculty conduct research that addresses issues associated with health, disability, and aging and translates into practical solutions that enhance quality of life. The College has had a remarkable record of achievement. Over the last few years, every aspect of what we do—research, instruction, and public outreach—has gained significantly in strength. In fact: College Record Our service unit, the Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES), has a record of leadership and is nationally recognized for providing outstanding support and services for students with psychological, physical and learning disabilities. Research is focused on improving health and well-being with college-wide research initiatives in the areas of aging and disability. Approximately 77% of College of Applied Health Sciences faculty members serve as Principal Investigators. Within the last 10 years, eight of our faculty members have received the Campus Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. The Undergraduate Advising Program in the College is outstanding. Our supportive and encouraging advising staff works to ensure that students have the resources and the experience necessary to achieve their long-term career goals The Mannie L. Jackson Illinois Academic Enrichment and Leadership Program (I-LEAP), the Edmund J. James Scholar Honors Program, and the Career Development and Leadership Awards Program have all been recognized as model programs and initiatives on-campus, in the state, and in the nation. We offer five undergraduate degree programs with 11 different areas of concentration, and four graduate programs with more than 20 areas of study. The Khan Annex of Huff Hall, opened in Fall 2011, houses our Center on Health, Aging, and Disability, which provides leadership in interdisciplinary research, education, and outreach efforts that promote health and wellness, healthy aging across the lifespan, healthy communities, and optimal participation of individuals with disabilities. In February 2012, we announced plans to build the Center for Wounded Veterans in Higher Education to provide educationally integrated services to student veterans of recent conflicts who have sustained severe and multiple injuries. We are now fundraising for that project. We have an exciting future ahead of us, which includes addressing some of society's most pressing needs and concerns in a richly collaborative environment in the college and across this nationally and internationally recognized campus. I'd like to invite you to explore our website to learn more about the exciting opportunities in the College. Sincerely, Tanya M.
