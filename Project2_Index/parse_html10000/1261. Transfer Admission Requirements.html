Major Preparation If you are applying to an impacted major, you are strongly encouraged to complete all lower-division major courses prior to transferring. See Transfer Preparation for more on Major Preparation and General Education Requirements  Transferability More than 90% of UC San Diego transfer students are from California community colleges. We also accept transfer students from other UC campuses and from four-year institutions. We are unable to evaluate coursework for applicants prior to admission due to the high volume of applications. Ensure your courses are transferable: California community college students: See the UC transferable course list on the ASSIST website. Other UC campus students: All courses completed at a UC campus during a regular or summer session (excluding UC Extension) are transferable. UC Extension courses numbering 1–199 are also transferable. All other transfer applicants: UC San Diego accepts transfer courses from accredited post-secondary institutions similar in content to those offered in the UC system. Transfer from semester to quarter system To avoid duplicating coursework, complete all courses within a sequence before transfer (i.e. Chemistry 1A-1B). Review additional details Check transferability information at the University of California website. Limits on transfer units Students will be granted up to 70 semester (105 quarter) units of credit for lower-division coursework completed at any institution (or combination of institutions). See Senior Standing details, below. For units beyond the maximum, subject credit for appropriate coursework will be granted and may be used to satisfy requirements: units earned through AP, IB, and/or A-Level examinations are not included in the limitation (do not put applicants at risk of being denied admission); units earned at any UC campus in Extension, summer, cross/concurrent and regular academic year enrollment are not included in the limitation but are added to the maximum transfer credit allowed (may put applicants at risk of being denied admission due to excessive units).
