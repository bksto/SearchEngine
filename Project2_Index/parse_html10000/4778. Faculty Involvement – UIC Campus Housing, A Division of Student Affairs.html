This has clearly been one of the goals of our residence life program. In the past several years, many faculty members have responded generously with their time and effort and have assisted in the process of supporting the growth of resident students outside the classroom. Faculty in Residence & Alumni The Faculty Members in Residence Program offers the opportunity for selected faculty and their families to live in a residential community with students. It is a unique experience that encourages a crucial link between students and faculty. In order to facilitate contact with students, the Resident Faculty will work closely with the Residence Life staff and the Residence Hall Association. Faculty Associates This initiative began in Fall 2002. Individual Faculty Associates are assigned to one specific floor in the residence hall, if possible based on a match between the individual Faculty Member and the types of students living on that floor. Faculty Associates provide another vital link between resident students and faculty and hopefully will foster a greater sense of community here at UIC—with an eye toward our primary goal of student retention and student success. Visiting Scholars When visiting faculty members or researchers are on campus, they can be offered a free space to stay in the JST Visiting Scholar apartment. As part of the program, scholars interact with students regularly and advise them on living and learning in college. For more information, visit the Visiting Scholar in Residence page. Faculty Fellows The Faculty Fellows program, started in 2000, provides a way of recognizing educators who have been especially active and supportive of our Residence Life program. These faculty have provided assistance related to programs in the residence halls, informal dinners, and discussions with residents, among other contributions.
