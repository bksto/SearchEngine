(510) 642-4357 RCC Office Hours RCCs hold office hours at each residential unit's Academic Services Center (ASC) and at the Computing Center in University Village, where you can drop by with questions or for advice. During office hours, an RCC will troubleshoot your laptop or schedule a time for an in-room appointment for assistance with your desktop, network connection, or any other problems you might be experiencing. For more information about services and resources offered at your unit's ASC, visit the Academic Services website. RCC appointments If you're experiencing problems with your computer or network connection, you can schedule an appointment through the online Helpdesk and an RCC will come to your room or apartment to provide one-on-one technical support. Log in to the Helpdesk to select an RCC appointment time that works for your schedule. If there are hardware problems with your computer, you will need to sign a liability release in order to allow an RCC to access your computer's hardware. If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you cannot sign a valid waiver and your RCC will not be able to alter or repair your hardware.
