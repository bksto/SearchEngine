(Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) More San Jose Earthquakes news SAN JOSE -- Almost everyone agrees the Earthquakes have upgraded their roster heading into the Major League Soccer opener Saturday at FC Dallas. Just how much better it is will determine their success in a vastly improved Western Conference. Despite the Quakes' giddiness over a new coach, new stadium and major roster changes, most MLS pundits predict another dismal year in San Jose. No one is suggesting the Earthquakes will suffer the ignominy of another 14-game winless streak that landed them in last place in 2014. But as San Jose got stronger, so did the competition. The West lost perennial loser Chivas USA, which disbanded, but gained Eastern Conference powers Sporting Kansas City and the Houston Dynamo in realignment. Expansion teams Orlando City FC and New York City FC prompted the moves that make it even more difficult for the Quakes to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2012. They have qualified for the postseason only twice since re-entering the league in 2008. It could stay that way even with six of the 10 conference teams advancing to MLS Cup playoffs next fall. The defending champion Los Angeles Galaxy lost star Landon Donovan to retirement but signed Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, who is scheduled to arrive by summer. Seattle Sounders FC, the Portland Timbers, Real Salt Lake, the Vancouver Whitecaps, the Galaxy, Dallas and Sporting open the year as the playoff favorites.

After going 6-16-12 (30 points) last year, the Quakes fired coach Mark Watson and hired Dominic Kinnear to guide them through the inaugural season at 18,000-seat Avaya Stadium. Offseason changes came as expected. Gone are goalkeeper Jon Busch, midfielders Sam Cronin, Yannick Djalo and Atiba Harris and defender Jason Hernandez. Newcomers are midfielders Fatai Alashe, Leandro Barrera and Sanna Nyassi, forwards Innocent Emeghara and Mark Sherrod and defenders Paulo Renato and Marvell Wynne (son of the former baseball outfielder of the same name). "We're definitely a lot deeper than we have been," goalkeeper David Bingham said. A breakdown of positions: Goalkeepers One of the Quakes' biggest questions is how Bingham handles replacing Busch, who led MLS last year with 137 saves. The team let the veteran go in favor of Bingham, 25, who has five MLS appearances since signing with San Jose in 2011. "I don't feel any pressure taking over for Jon Busch," Bingham said. "If we play bad we're out of a job, that's the pressure." The Earthquakes' big-picture plans hit a snag in the offseason when veteran Andy Gruenebaum decided to retire after the team picked him in the re-entry draft. Keep an eye on backup Bryan Meredith, who made 12 appearances for Seattle in 2012 and had three shutouts. Defenders The Quakes lost center back Hernandez to New York City FC in the expansion draft and waived Uruguayan fullback Pablo Pintos. But the back line has been bolstered by newcomers Renato, a Portuguese center back, and Wynne, a versatile defender. Aging central defenders Victor Bernardez and Clarence Goodson anchor the defense with Jordan Stewart holding down the left side. The question is whether returning right back Brandon Barklage has found his confidence. If not, the position is Wynne's. Reserves Ty Harden and Shaun Francis also can expect playing time with injuries and national team call-ups always looming. Midfielders Benfica of Lisbon loaned oft-injured Djalo to a Russian club, although the Quakes wanted him back. San Jose instead found other options in Nyassi, a Gambian who has had a breakout winter camp. Another newcomer with promise is Barrera, from Argentina. They give the flanks needed speed with returnees Shea Salinas and Cordell Cato. Argentine designated player Matias Perez Garcia suffered a knee injury in his second game last summer and made only six appearances. The attacking midfielder should have a much better go this year. Kinnear also can play budding U.S. star Tommy Thompson in the midfield or the front line. The Quakes traded Cronin to Colorado, but expect big improvements from second-year player JJ Koval of Stanford and French veteran Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi. The team also got Michigan State's Alashe with the No. 4 pick of the MLS draft. Alashe has the promise to become the box-to-box midfielder the Earthquakes badly need. Forwards Kinnear appears to have plenty of options to go big, small or something of a mix. Whatever he does, the offense probably will be built around Chris Wondolowski, the team's bona fide star. The biggest anticipation is how well Emeghara does in his MLS debut. The Swiss designated player gives San Jose blistering speed up front, meaning Wondolowski might play more as a secondary forward. Veteran Mike Fucito looks healthy after struggling with injuries for two seasons and could spell Emeghara. If the team needs more power, it has veteran Steven Lenhart back -- once the target forward has fully recovered from a knee injury. In the meantime, Stanford alum Adam Jahn has bulked up and gained better ball control to score seven preseason goals. Kinnear also brought in 6-3 forward Sherrod, who is recovering from right knee surgery. "You can vary the way you play any minute of the game," Kinnear said. "Maybe we're good on set pieces, maybe play a little more direct or play on your feet. It's good to have that balance."
