Hines College of Architecture offers a Bachelor of Science in Interior Architecture, enabling students to become effective design leaders and innovators. Design is the focus of undergraduate studies and provides students with access to resources involving research, building and community components. Students gain hands-on experience in studio courses with guidance from experienced faculty. Degree Plan The program for the Bachelor of Science in Interior Architecture degree is a four-year program focusing on the design of architectural interiors with particular focus on sustainability, materiality, color theory, lighting, and the social and cultural aspects of habitable space. The program offers 132 semester hours and includes 77 semester hours of Interior Architecture and Architecture courses, 38 of which are advanced hours (3000-level or higher). The degree includes the University’s required core curriculum and 7 semester hours of elective courses. Because of the mutual and overlapping bonds of Architecture, Industrial Design, and Interior Architecture, the programs share a common first semester curriculum, and Interior Architecture and Architecture share studios through the Foundation Level.
