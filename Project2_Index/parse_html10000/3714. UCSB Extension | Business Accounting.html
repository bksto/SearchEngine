In order to receive certificate credit for courses taken, students must earn letter grades of "C" or better in all credit courses. Most students take two to three years to complete the program; however, you may proceed at your own pace, depending on how many courses are available each quarter. Students have five years from the date their first course ends to complete the program. Course Prerequisites Most courses will require the prerequisites of either Principles of Financial Accounting I (Econ X40A) and Principles of Financial Accounting II (Econ X40B), equivalent training, or consent of the instructor. Students are responsible for meeting individual course prerequisites (or possessing equivalent knowledge) prior to enrolling in courses. Prerequisites ensure that all students have the appropriate background before entering a course. Recommended Course Sequence It is recommended for students new to business accounting that they begin with Intermediate Accounting I (Econ X120A) and follow the courses as they are sequentially offered. Refer to the planned course schedule for recommended sequence of classes. Individual courses are open to non-certificate students who wish to study a specific subject area. Course Prerequisites, Recommended Course Sequence, Course Credit/Transfer, Instructors As the continuing education division of the University of California at Santa Barbara, UCSB Extension is fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). All courses in the program are approved for professional-level, post-graduate credit. This type of credit is typically recognized by government and industry for full or partial tuition funding or reimbursement. Course units and/or continuing education units (CEU) values are listed with the course descriptions. Completion of the program shows evidence to a prospective or current employer of recent professional-level training and development in this field for career advancement and/or salary increase purposes. Questions concerning transferability of credit toward degree programs at other schools should be directed to the degree-granting institution. Transfer Credit Business Accounting: Transfer credit is limited to 8 quarter units. Proposed transfer courses taken at other schools must be comparable in content and length to the UCSB Extension equivalent and must have been taken from an accredited college or university within the last five years. To determine whether courses taken at other schools will qualify, send a copy of the course title and description and the dates the course was taken along with the UCSB Extension course title equivalent(s) to the certificate advisor. The advisor will inform students whether the coursework is transferable. To activate the formal transfer of credit, students must have filed their Application for Candidacy in the certificate program and must request the school previously attended to send an official transcript to the certificate advisor. Applying for Candidacy To be accepted as a candidate in a certificate program, students must first submit the Application for Candidacy Form below and a one-time, nonrefundable filing fee of $100. Students will be expected to fulfill program requirements in place at the time candidacy is filed. Students will automatically be notified of acceptance once the application and filing fee are received. Allow four to six weeks for applications to be processed. Acceptance letters are mailed upon acceptance into the program. Certificate candidates must notify the UCSB Extension certificate advisor by phoning (805) 893-3816 or by e-mailing when they receive the grade for their final course. Once your final grade is received and your records are checked to verify that you have met all program requirements, your certificate is processed and mailed to you. Duplicate certificates are available if requested in writing. There is a $22 charge for each duplicate certificate. Program Cost Business Accounting: estimated $3,090 The total cost of the program is determined by the number of units required to complete the entire curriculum and the actual courses taken, particularly in the area of elective courses where tuition fees can vary greatly.
