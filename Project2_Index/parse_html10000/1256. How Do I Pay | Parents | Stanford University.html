Stanford assumes that students understand and will honor this financial obligation. While the university acknowledges parents’ financial support, payment is the responsibility of the student. Students may authorize parents or others to access their Stanford account and make payments on their behalf through Axess, the student database system. Visit the parents page of the Student Financial Services website. To learn more about such subjects as the University Bill, tuition insurance plans and tax information. Parents can contact the Student Services Center at (866) 993-7772 or (650) 723-7772 with questions about the university bill. However, information specific to a student account may be discussed only with the people authorized by the student to receive such information. Financial Aid Stanford has one of the strongest financial aid programs among U.S. colleges and universities. Stanford's financial aid program is need-based, meaning that all aid eligibility is determined by a family’s financial circumstances. While you and your students have the primary responsibility for paying for college, financial aid can bridge the gap between the total costs and the ability to pay.
