Welcome Home Veterans Be sure to note your veteran status on your Application for Admission. The application fee is waived for our veterans. The University of Kentucky is extremely proud of its long standing relationship with the men and women in uniform that bravely serve this country. From its founding as a Land Grant University in 1865, charged with teaching agriculture, mechanics, and military tactics, to its continuing production of leaders for the Army and Air Force through the Reserve Officer Training Corps, UK has consistently contributed to the defense of freedom. It has also consistently honored its veterans through such notable campus landmarks as the iconic Memorial Hall and Memorial Coliseum. The Veterans Resource Center was established to continue that tradition of support by providing UK's military and veteran populations with the service and assistance they deserve. Our goal is to ensure that your transition to college is as smooth as possible. Whether you are entering college for the first time, transferring from another school, or returning after a deployment, the Wildcat community welcomes you home. The Veterans Resource Center is located in 124 Funkhouser Building across the hall from the Office of Undergraduate Admission. The Veterans Resource Team is made up of dedicated professionals who have an interest in your success. The Team is comprised of professionals from several departments across campus, all with the common goal of helping our veterans accomplish their academic mission. In addition, UK has two student organizations dedicated to the service of our active military and veteran populations: The University of Kentucky Student Veterans Association (UKSVA) is comprised of student veterans dedicated to the recruitment, education, and support of all veterans attending the University. Honoring Our Military Everywhere (HOME) is a student organization that supports our troops both at home and abroad. The University of Kentucky also proudly hosts two stellar Reserve Officer Training programs that continue to produce quality leadership for the Army and Air Force.
