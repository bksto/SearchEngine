Earning Credit for an Internship Many of CSUSM’s academic departments offer credit-bearing internship courses; some are open to non-majors while others are required/restricted courses open only to students in those majors. In order to earn academic credit for an internship experience, you must be enrolled in an internship course. Please contact the faculty member of your internship course to determine course requirements, supplemental department forms/processes, recommended internship placement sites, major-specific internship credit limitations, and other pertinent guidance. Selecting and Internship Site If your faculty member directs you to the Office of Internships for assistance in identifying placement sites, please browse the listing of internship opportunities. Steps for securing internship: Browse listing of opportunities. Consult with your internship course faculty member to ensure appropriateness. Apply for an internship position by following the specific instructions detailed in the position listing. The positions may use varying screening methods including written application, resume review, interviews, etc. After you have secured a faculty-approved internship placement, contact the Office of Internships at 760-750-7005 or internships@csusm.edu to determine whether the community/industry partner has a current Community Partnership Agreement on file with CSUSM. Complete the Participation Guidelines and Release documents and return to the Office of Internships in Craven Hall 6109. Check with your internship course faculty for additional forms and requirements. For example, some faculty/courses require a learning plan. You may also be asked to log your hours on a time sheet. Other Tips/Suggestions Do not wait until you are a graduating senior to consider taking an internship course – explore the idea as a sophomore or junior. Internship course offerings vary by semester. Check with your department, program advisor or internship course instructor for updated course offerings, requirements, important deadlines and enrollment procedures. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
