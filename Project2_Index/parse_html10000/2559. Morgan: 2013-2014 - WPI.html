Moruzzi Young Faculty Award for Innovation in Undergraduate Education for his efforts in cyber security education. WPI assistant professor of computer science Craig Shue has won the 2014 Romeo L. Moruzzi Young Faculty Award for Innovation in Undergraduate Education for his efforts to innovate cyber security education. The award recognizes pre-tenure faculty members who have made a specific improvement to undergraduate education at WPI. Shue was nominated by fellow faculty and students for developing WPI’s first undergraduate network security course—an effort that has been met with wide praise for its exciting game-like elements and real-world applicability. In the course, students complete “missions” using an educational technology module called ScoreKeeper, which Shue created to enable students to experiment and test different threat scenarios. Students note that the course not only helped them learn but also brought them together as a community. The ScoreKeeper module also demonstrates ambitious scope and international novelty that is especially relevant in today’s climate of increasing cyber security challenges. It is part of InstructAssist, a sophisticated set of interacting programs built by Shue that is aimed at improving the quality of interaction in lectures and managing project teams. The Moruzzi Award was established in 1999 in honor of former WPI electrical and computer engineering faculty member Romeo Moruzzi, who was instrumental in bringing tenure to the faculty of WPI and helping establish the WPI Plan in 1970. Award winners receive $5,000 in professional development funds.   May 1, 2014   Academics Morgan Teaching and Learning Center About Us Resources for New Faculty Resources for All Faculty Resources for TAs & Supervisors News 2014-2015 2013-2014 2012-2013 Events Funding Opportunities Contact Morgan Teaching and Learning Center Chrysanthe Demetry, Ph.D., Director Gordon Library, Room 302 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5707 morgan-center@wpi.edu Related Sites Certificate in College Teaching Academic Technology Center (ATC) Center for Communication Across the Curicculum Project Advising Resources Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
