It is the principal mechanism for consultative participation by the University community in the administrative decisions of the President. This legislative body is comprised of approximately 50 elected faculty representatives, 4  administrators, and 2 students. The Academic Senate formulates and evaluates policy and procedures on academic, fiscal, and personnel matters. The work of the Senate is accomplished through its several committees (comprised of approximately 130 faculty, administrators, and students), which received their charges from the Academic Senate Executive Committee. Recommended action is forwarded to the Academic Senate for deliberation and then to the President for approval and implementation. In addition, the Academic Senate may make recommendations to the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the CSU Academic Senate that it judges will benefit the CSU.
