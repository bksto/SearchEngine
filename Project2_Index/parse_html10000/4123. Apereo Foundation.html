We support software used in thousands of educational institutions worldwide, ranging from the CAS single-sign on solution, through uPortal, to the Sakai collaboration and learning environment, and the Apereo Open Academic Environment - a next generation cloud-based platform for academic collaboration. We're also the place new projects supporting higher education can find support and sustenance. Our incubation process supports new projects as they find the path from innovation to sustainability, with communities developing around products such as Bedework, a calendaring solution, and Student Success Plan, recipient of a $1.5m grant from the Next Generation Learning Challenge Program to develop an open source solution to support early intervention and student retention. Opencast Matterhorn, a lecture capture and media services platform, UniTime, a higher education timetabling and scheduling system, EDexchange, a transcript exchange solution, and Karuta, a next generation eportfolio initiative have recently entered our incubation process. Apereo is a global network, with member institutions on six continents. We seek to actively develop partnerships to further our mission to create and sustain software supporting learning, teaching and research. Our partnership with our sister organisation, the ESUP consortium in France, creates a network of over one hundred and eighty higher educational institutions and partners.
