Recognized as one of the top 200 research-funded institutions in the world, it's fair to say that UIC faculty discover what others teach. Two members are MacArthur Genius Award winners, and others have earned awards, fellowships and grant support from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the National Academy of Science, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Sloan Foundation, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Education and more. But perhaps the strength of our faculty is best illustrated by the success of our students. Since 2001, 35 have earned Fulbright Fellowships, 16 have received Goldwater Scholarships and three have been awarded Gates-Cambridge Scholarships. With nearly 2,574 instructional faculty members, there is one faculty member to every 11 students. What's more, 75 percent of tenured faculty members teach undergraduate courses and 83 percent of full-time instructional faculty have earned a PhD or equivalent. What does this mean to UIC students? Our low student-to-faculty ratio ensures access to nationally and globally recognized scientists, researchers, artists, writers, clinicians, educators and other scholars. What's more, as our faculty advance their areas of study, students benefit as the latest trends and insights are brought directly into the classroom. For listings of faculty members, please refer to individual Undergraduate Majors or Graduate and Professional Degree Programs. Find out about faculty involvement in campus housing.
