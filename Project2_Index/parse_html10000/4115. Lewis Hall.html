About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > Green College > Green Buildings > Lewis Hall Lewis Hall Lewis Hall is a one-story, earth-sheltered, 14,484 square foot “green” high-performance building, named in honor of Congressman Jerry Lewis. The building is located just north of the existing courtyard of the Stauffer Science Center. The building contains a central courtyard, crowned by a space-frame trellis, while the roof and most exterior walls of the building are covered with earth and native planting materials. The structure consists of poured-in-place concrete for the floor, walls, and roof. The building houses 3 classrooms, 2 project studios, 3 GIS labs, 11 faculty offices for Environmental Studies and the Masters-in-GIS Program, 6 research offices for the Redlands Institute, two operations hubs/reception areas, a small conference room, work room, IT server rooms, and an open office configuration of work stations for secretarial support, research staff, and student interns. All classrooms, studios, and labs are “smart,” with the latest audio-visual and wireless computer technology. Occupation of the building began in early September, 2005. Design and construction conformed to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) requirements for Green Building Certification Version 2.1, earning Lewis Hall a Silver Level certificate. A few of the environmental performance indicators evaluated are erosion & sedimentation control, alternative transportation options, stormwater management, heat island effect, water efficient landscaping, CFC reduction, storage & collection of recyclables, low-emitting materials, and recycled content. The building utilizes energy efficient design and a small photovoltaic array which generates a total of 9.4 kW. The space frame over the courtyard is designed to support additional modules, particularly as translucent PV technology becomes cost-effective. Additional green features include: Erosion and sediment control Water efficient landscaping and plumbing fixtures (e.g., low flush toilets and waterless urinals) Bicycle racks "Green" roof design appropriate to arid climates Demolition and building material resource reuse and recycling Recycled carpeting Native plants and decomposed granite covering building exterior Use of nontoxic glues and other materials to protect indoor air quality Extensive use of natural daylighting Certified wood (50% of wood based materials) Integration of indoor-outdoor environments through placement of a courtyard (featuring a dry stream bed and native plantings) and an amphitheater designed for use as an outdoor classroom LCD display screens linked to sensors for use in tracking building performance and for visualizing interactions between environmental systems and human social systems.
