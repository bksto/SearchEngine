Your Engineering Student Services (ESS) adviser works with you throughout your entire undergraduate career and is your key to a successful experience at Berkeley. ESS advisers are available to help with everything related to your undergraduate education. They answer questions about degree and graduation requirements as well as academic policies and procedures. They assist with course selection and help address challenges you may be facing in your studies. They can suggest enrichment opportunities or make referrals to campus resources. They’re here to offer guidance and support. Students admitted as undeclared work with a special adviser until they declare a major; at that point, their ESS adviser will be based on their new major. New students: You must attend CalSO or complete a virtual CalSO (in mid-June) before you can meet with an ESS adviser.
