These are all critical components of thinking and knowing. This data visualization tool, created by Rebecca Mazur, a web developer at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, allows users to see how faculty, academic programs, and research and teaching areas come together at the School. Aspiration in Action Fostering Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship The Harvard Innovation Lab (i-lab) offers programs designed to help students pursue their ideas and ventures at any stage of development, covering a wide range of disciplines. The Innovators’ Practice: Ideas With Impact Lecturer Beth Altringer's course "The Innovators’ Practice" simulates the hurdles innovators must clear as they run with their ideas in the real world. Environmental Law and Policy at HLS The Environmental Law Program at Harvard Law School (HLS) offers students a targeted blend of courses, clinics, and hands-on environmental experience. Students as Curators Students in Professor Jennifer L. Roberts’s tutorial course created a full-fledged exhibition at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum about the relationship between artist Jasper Johns’s paintings and prints. Tackling Blindness, Deafness Through Microengineering New grants for five research projects awarded by the Bertarelli Program in Translational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering. Java in the Genes An international research team has found six new genes underlying our coffee-slurping ways. Recreating Bacteria for Innovation Harvard team lays foundation for using biofilms to create self-healing materials and other technologies. Magnetic attraction System that prompts objects to 'float' in suspension could prove a boon to manufacturing with fragile materials. Ways to Support To achieve our aspirations, Harvard will build on strengths across the University. There have never been more great ideas, great thinkers, or great opportunities worthy of your support. Below are just a few examples. Visting Artists' Space Underwrite a new studio and arts-making facility where visiting artists can mentor and collaborate with students and faculty. Student Research Opportunities  Offer the resources enabling undergraduate and graduate students to have hands-on research experiences—in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and leadership— during the J-term or summer.   Contact us for more information on how you can get involved.
