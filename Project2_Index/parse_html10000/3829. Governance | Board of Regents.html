The governing documents of the Board include its Bylaws, Standing Orders, and Regents Policies which are adopted by the Board and define the parameters for how the Board, in collaboration with President, governs the institution. The Bylaws and Standing Orders establish the rules by which the Board organizes itself and conducts business.
