Most models do not include snow aging and interactive snow-aerosol radiative transfer processes, both of which are necessary to capture the full snow-albedo feedbacks in a realistic manner.  Furthermore, most modeling studies use coarse resolution GCMs, which cannot adequately resolve complex mountainous terrain and associated precipitation/snow processes. In this work, we develop a more physically-based model by improving snow processes in SSiB land surface model that is coupled with WRF regional climate model (RCM). This is accomplished by introducing SNICAR model (Flanner & Zender, 2006) into WRF/SSiB, which simulates snow aging and vertically-resolved radiative transfer in the snowpack. We also further modify WRF/SSiB to account for physical presence of impurities in snow, their movement within the pack, and removal by meltwater. Here, we present model development technique, validation with in situ observations, and preliminary results from the RCM simulations. We find that by including snow/aerosol interactions, the model is able to realistically simulate observed surface water and energy balances. Over western U.S., realistic aerosol deposition in snow induces a springtime average radiative forcing of 33W/m2, a regional surface warming of 1.46°K, and a snowpack reduction of 40mm. The preliminary RCM results also suggest this aerosols-in-snow radiative forcing has an effect on regional land-atmosphere interactions and atmospheric circulation, such as the North American monsoon.  AOS 270: Qianli Ma Seminar Wed, Mar 11, 2015 3:30pm to 4:30pm MS 7124 A Read More Calendar Events list Events archive University of California, Los Angeles; Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences; Los Angeles, CA 90095-1565 | Phone: (310) 825-1217 | © 2015 UC Regents site by Pendari
