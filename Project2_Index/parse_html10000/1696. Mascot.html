Origin of the Bulldogs On a brisk October evening in 1917, the University of Redlands football team defeated the Whittier College Poets by a score of 20-0. The following issue of the U of R Campus newspaper (now known as the Bulldog Weekly) featured an article, "Baptist Bulldogs defeat Quaker Poets 20-0", which included a quote from the opposing team's coach: "The U of R football team might well be called the Bulldogs of the conference for the fight they put into the game last Saturday." The name stuck, and beginning in 1918, a dog named General Haig—named after the famous World War I general—became the University’s first live mascot, kicking off a tradition of several canine icons throughout Redlands’ history.
