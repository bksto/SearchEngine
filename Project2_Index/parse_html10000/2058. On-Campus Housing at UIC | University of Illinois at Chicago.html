Not surprisingly, commuting is a popular choice for many UIC students. But make no mistake...UIC offers plenty of on-campus housing options to thousands of students who prefer the ease of living close to campus. Each UIC residence hall is within walking distance to cafeterias and recreational facilities, and includes standard residence hall amenities (air conditioning, heat, free laundry, kitchenettes and Internet connection). Our newest residence hall, James Stukel Towers, offers four-, five- or eight-person suites, gorgeous skyline views as well as a dining hall and meeting rooms.
