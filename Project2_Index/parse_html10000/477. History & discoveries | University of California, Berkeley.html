Photo © UC Regents Following the gold rush that brought hundreds of thousands of people to the state, the University of California is founded when two institutions merge - the private College of California in Oakland, and a new state land-grant institution, the Agricultural, Mining and Mechanical Arts College. Leaders of the two institutions decide to join the two schools. A mere 10 faculty members and 40 students make up the new university when it opens. 1870 University president Henry Durant 1870 - University president Henry Durant × 1870 - University president Henry Durant University president Henry Durant Photo © UC Regents In 1853, Durant came to California and founded the Contra Costa Academy as a private school for boys. In 1855, the school was chartered as the College of California, which later merged with the state of California’s Agricultural, Mining and Mechanical Arts College to create the University of California in 1868. Durant was elected the first president of the University of California in 1870 and resigned two years later. He would later be elected the 16th mayor of Oakland. 1872 University president Daniel Coit Gilman 1872 - University president Daniel Coit Gilman × 1872 - University president Daniel Coit Gilman University president Daniel Coit Gilman Photo courtesy of The Bancroft Library Gilman was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College, and served as the second president of the University of California, the first president of Johns Hopkins University and the founding president of the Carnegie Institution.

Herma Hill Kay, a faculty member at Boalt Hall, co-drafts California’s 1970 no-fault divorce law, the first of its kind in the nation. The law eliminates the need to place blame on a spouse for a failed marriage and makes “irreconcilable differences” sufficient ground for divorce. Eventually, every state in the nation enacts some version of no-fault divorce. Kay later serves as the first female dean of the law school (1992-2000). 1967 Molecular evolution 1967 - Molecular evolution × 1967 - Molecular evolution Molecular evolution Photo copyright © UC Regents Biochemist Allan Wilson establishes the field of molecular evolution, using genetic material, rather than fossils, to investigate the origins of humanity. Wilson and doctoral student Vincent Sarich show that proteins evolve and change as life evolves, and consequently can serve as a “molecular clock” to measure the evolutionary relationships between animals and humans. In the early 1980s, Wilson and colleagues defy conventional thinking (which dates human origins to some 25 million years ago); they trace humans back to common ancestors in sub-Saharan Africa some 200,000 years ago. Today, scientists compare DNA to determine evolutionary family trees. 1970s Oncogenes 1970s - Oncogenes × 1970s - Oncogenes Oncogenes Oncogene activation Molecular and cell biologist Peter Duesberg discovers the first cancer-causing gene, or “oncogene,” in a virus.

During the war, male enrollment drops more than 50 percent, and many male students are Army and Navy members in officer training programs. Women at Berkeley enjoy greater opportunities to assume leadership positions during this time. For example, the Daily Californian (student newspaper) and the Blue and Gold (yearbook) have their first female editors during these years, and women head ASUC student government.

Photo courtesy of The Bancroft Library © UC Regents The Cold War era sees waves of organizing at Berkeley. The targets are a campus administrative ban on socialist or communist speakers and a loyalty oath for UC employees statewide. The oath, approved by the regents in 1949, requires each faculty, staff and student employee to declare in writing that he or she is not a member of the Communist Party. A number of faculty reject the use of coercive oaths in a democracy and organize a resistance movement. The regents eventually rescind the oath and the California Supreme Court sides with those employees who refused to sign and lost their jobs. 1961 Ludwig Fountain 1961 - Ludwig Fountain × 1961 - Ludwig Fountain Ludwig Fountain Photo courtesy of The Bancroft Library © UC Regents The regents name a fountain on Sproul Plaza after a German short-haired pointer named Ludwig von Schwanenberg who had visited it daily. 1962 John F.

After the Free Speech Movement in 1964, the Berkeley campus is in the national spotlight as a hotbed of political action. Students and community members hold marches, rallies and sit-ins over the years. At several points these demonstrations become violent clashes with law enforcement and Berkeley remains in national headlines. 1969 People's Park protests 1969 - People's Park protests × 1969 - People's Park protests People's Park protests Photo courtesy of The Bancroft Library © UC Regents Students protest the development plans of a three-acre lot south of campus. The University had purchased the land in 1967 with plans to demolish existing residences and build an athletic field and student housing on the site. After demolishing the existing structures, the lot sat vacant for over a year. A group of student activists and community members planned to turn the lot into a public park, but these plans were not approved by university administration. Students and community members protest further development, and confrontations with law enforcement become violent. Gov. Ronald Reagan, who campaigned on a promise to “clean up” the student unrest at Berkeley, eventually sends National Guard troops to quell the confrontation. Late 1960s DeCal classes Late 1960s - DeCal classes × Late 1960s - DeCal classes DeCal classes Photo © UC Regents In response to student interest an innovative program of student-initiated courses launches, known as the Program for Democratic Education at Cal or DeCal. Students also win an expanded role in university governance.
