A wide variety of facilities are required to meet the needs of nearly 14,000 students that attend SBVC each and every semester. Walking through the campus, you may see a concert break out in the Greek Theatre. You might enjoy a hand-prepared lunch in the Sunroom. And, as the daylight fades to evening, the Planetarium show can reveal the sky above you in a way you never imagined. For more information on reserving SBVC facilities for your event or activity, contact the Office of the Vice President of Administrative Services.
