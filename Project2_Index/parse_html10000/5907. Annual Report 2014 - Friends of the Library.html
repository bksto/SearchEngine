The March 6th lecture by Alan Taylor, Pulitzer Prize winner and 2013 National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction, was not part of our 2013-2014 Author Lecture Series, but was added because Taylor’s book, The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War in Virginia, 1772-1832, had not been published when we completed the author lineup for the year and his scholarship was especially notable.  In August, he will become the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation Chair at the University of Virginia. The 2013-2014 Author Lecture Series concludes on April 17th at our Annual Meeting. Local author Anthony Barcellos will discuss his novel, Land of Milk and Money. The Board held a fall and spring grant cycle, approving $12,200 for the purchase of books and other media.  Since the founding of the Friends considerably more than $200,000.00 has been granted or donated to the Library for this purpose, which remains of great importance to the Board and of significant benefit to the Library and the students, staff, and faculty of the University.  Once again the Board has donated or granted the bulk of its revenue to the Library in a most timely manner.  We also appreciate a gift of $500.00 from the Retirees Association for the purchase of books.  The Book Bin continues to be of enormous importance to the Friends as its major source of revenue. Lou Lower, the coordinator of the Book Bin, and her many volunteers deserve our deepest gratitude for the services they perform week in and week out.   In consultation with the Book Bin Volunteers, I have created a Book Bin handout which is presently being reviewed by University Marketing for approval and distribution.  A Book Bin Volunteer email list is now available and I have been using it on a regular basis for the past two weeks. Bookends, the Friends newsletter, was published in the fall and spring.  Its editor, Roz Van Auker, is always seeking articles and interesting commentary for future issues.  Friends are urged to contact her with ideas or potential contributions.  The Bookends publication schedule has been closely maintained by Roz with our thanks. In order to enhance the grant program the Board has streamlined its operations by going online for the majority of communications with the Friends membership.  By preparing Bookends in-house and distributing it online we are able to reallocate as much as $4,000 annually to the grant program.  Bookends is mailed to our Friends who do not use or have a computer at home. Our spring issue was available online on April 2nd and was mailed first class to those at home on April 3rd. On December 4th, the Friends co-hosted an exhibit and reception with the Library’s Special Collections & University Archives in celebration of Frank La Pena’s generous donation of the Frank La Pena Collection and in honor of Native American Heritage Month and the Indian communities of the Sacramento region. On January 2nd, the Friends began accepting credit cards for annual renewals and other monetary donations and gifts.  This will be an important convenience for all our Friends in the years ahead.  Our thanks go to John Power and Lisa Woodard-Mink in University Development who worked with others in bringing this effort to a successful conclusion. In early April, a newly redesigned brochure was completed as well as a Book Bin handout and two flyers.  The Board will seek to place these items at optimum locations both on campus and in the community. April also brings to an end the first full year of the Friends redesigned and thoroughly revised website (www.folcsuslibrary.com).  The website has been exclusively maintained by your President, which is not an ideal situation.  Not a single piece of news has been received from anyone other than Roz with her editions of Bookends.  A one-sided communication tool cannot be considered a success and its future will be decided in the months ahead.  Membership There were approximately 88 members when we began the annual renewal period in late November. This number is down from previous years and is a major source of concern.  As your President, I have failed either to maintain or to increase membership in the Friends.  The goal of expanding membership by reaching out to the greater Sacramento community and by being more effective in terms of on-campus recruitment has not translated into any meaningful actions. It should be noted that in 1995 there were 220 members, with 85 from the Sacramento community. Currently, there are very few members from this community.  A Join Us! email letter was sent to  thirty top administrators on campus, including Deans and Associate/Assistant Deans.  As a result, our membership now includes three of the campus’s top administrators.     Fiscal Affairs The March 31, 2014 balance for the Friends was $15,689.99. The spring grant funds have been deducted although I expect up to $1,000 will be required for tax and shipping.  The Book Bin continued to be the main source of revenue, contributing over $9,000.00.   Acknowledgements The efforts of Bill Dorman, Vice President, and Jean Torcom, Secretary-Treasurer, were instrumental to whatever successes the Board achieved in 2013-2014.  Thanks must go out to them and the other members of the Friends Board of Directors: Robin Aurelius, Wesley Doak, Terry Kastanis, Peter Shattuck, Rosalind Van Auker, and Charlotte Xanders.  The ongoing and wonderful support of Sally Hitchcock, Coordinator for Community Outreach, and Ellen Young, Accounting/Budgeting, Library Office, is also acknowledged. The Board extends its grateful appreciation to Terry McDaniel and Nadeen Ruiz, who recently resigned from the Board.  At the same time, the Board welcomes Maryellen Bush-Dabaghian and Lisa Woodard-Mink.
