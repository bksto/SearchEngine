In a beautiful setting, the Gardens serves to provide a wide assortment of plant materials for courses at UCR and other local schools.

The Gardens also provides plant materials for various research projects and serves to test and exhibit plant species introduced from all parts of the world. The variable terrain and Riverside's subtropical climate create numerous "microclimates" which allow for the notable diversity of plantings.This wealth of vegetation creates a hospitable sanctuary for wildlife, where nearly 200 bird species have been officially observed.    Though maintained separately, the University of California Riverside campus grounds is also considered a part of the Botanic Gardens, and serves to demonstrate landscape plants that do well inRiverside's climate.
