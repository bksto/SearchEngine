It is pomp. It is pageantry. It is impressive and spectacular. It is joy and pride for your family, and it is precedent-setting for generations to follow. Commencement at the University of Houston is comprised of two coordinated ceremonies: University Commencement, held at TDECU Stadium, and College Convocation, held at locations around campus.  University Commencement is the formal university-wide celebration at which President Renu Khator officially confers degrees upon graduating students. The ceremony features a processional of graduates and faculty, remarks from the President, and a vibrant keynote speaker. University Commencement is an event not to be missed for students, families, and friends. College Convocation College Convocation is personal and meaningful. It is a shared celebration with faculty and friends of your college who have shaped your education. Hear your name called and walk across the stage to receive your accolades. For the complete commencement experience, graduates and their families are encouraged to attend both ceremonies. Don’t miss out on this unforgettable exclamation point on your UH career!
