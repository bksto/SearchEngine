UC Berkeley > CalParents > Make a Gift, Support Cal Make a Gift - Support Cal Cal Parents make a difference – by giving a gift, volunteering your time, hiring a student, there are numerous ways to be involved at Berkeley. The Cal Parents Fund Every year all Cal parents are invited to give a gift to the Cal Parents Fund or a program meaningful to their student, to ensure ongoing excellence at Berkeley.  A gift at any level enriches and enhances the already high quality programs and services Cal offers to your students.  State funding and tuition only cover a portion of the cost to educate a student at Berkeley.  Parent gifts are critical in covering this gap, and increasing the margin of excellence in Berkeley’s programs. Please consider making Berkeley a philanthropic priority.  The Cal Parents Fund provides immediate impact and critical support to three core areas: *Curriculum *Student Services *Faculty During our 2012-13 campaign, 4,400 Berkeley families contributed $2.1MM to The Cal Parents Fund and other campus annual giving funds. We invite you to join our community of donors to The Cal Parents Fund. Your gift is an important investment in your student and UC Berkeley.
