SOMeCA would like to congratulate one of our alumni on her recent accomplishment. Recently, President Obama appointed Tiffany Dena Loftin to a key Administration Post as a member of the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans. Tiffany Dena Loftin graduated with a degree in Political Science and American Studies. She found her first family in a recruitment program for black students called Destination Higher Education (DHE) and then walked into Rainbow Theater and the African Theater Arts Troupe. Tiffany was also elected to serve as the Internal Vice Chair and then Chair of the SUA. Tiffany is consistently working to make sure that communities of color and young people are ready to participate in democracy, and that young people fight for a world that we want and not one that is simply given to us. Congratulations Tiffany! Leadership: The Importance of Self-Agency A tradition of Transformative Leadership - SOMeCA alumni bring collaborative and purposeful leadership skills to their communities and careers. This week we are honored to feature Mr. Rafael López, Senior Policy Advisor for the Executive Office of the President (for identification purposes only).
