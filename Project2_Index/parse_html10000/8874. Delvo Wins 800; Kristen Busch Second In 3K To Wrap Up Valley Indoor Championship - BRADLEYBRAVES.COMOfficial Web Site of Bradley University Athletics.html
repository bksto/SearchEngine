The sophomore pair helped Bradley finish with a school record 46 points, surpassing the previous school mark for the league indoor championship of 38 points set in 1999 and the Braves finished eighth overall.  Delvo won the 800 meter title by more than one second, outkicking Loyola’s Rebecca Stearns for Bradley’s second individual title of the meet with a personal best time of 2:10.61.  The 800 meter title gave the Braves two individual champions at the Valley indoor championship for the first time since 1999.  Delvo’s time is second all-time at Bradley and was exactly one second off Mary Goldkamp’s school record time of 2:09.61 set in 2011. "What a fantastic meet for our women this weekend,” said Bradley head coach Marc Burns.  “We scored more points at this meet than any team at Bradley in the history of the program.  Sarah McMahon won the Elite 18 award for the third time in her career and Emily Delvo and Kristen Busch both won titles.  This was a great team effort in that everyone came to race.  We had two school records and multiple personal bests.” Busch nearly added a 3,000 meter title to her resume, finishing less than two seconds behind Valley champ Alyvia Clark of Loyola in second.  Clark crossed the line at 9:39.51, while Busch was close behind in second with a career-best 9:40.70.  Busch’s time is third in school history as she improved her career-best by four seconds.  Junior Sarah McMahon (Colfax, Wis./Colfax) was fifth in the 3,000 meters at 9:48.14, missing all-conference honors by six seconds.  Sophomore Caitlin Busch (Waterloo, Ill./Freeburg) also helped highlight the 3,000 meters for the Braves with a career-best time of 9:54.26 to finish 10th in the field.  For the third time in her career and the second straight MVC Indoor Track and Field Championship, McMahon was given the MVC Elite 18 Award, which was established by The Valley in the fall of 2010 to honor the highest achievement in academics and athletics by a student-athlete in each MVC-sponsored sport. Modeled after the NCAA Elite 88 Academic Recognition Award Program, the MVC Elite 18 Award is presented to the student-athlete with the highest cumulative grade-point average competing at the finals site at each of the MVC's 18 team championships.  The winner is chosen from nominated student-athletes who earn all-conference honors at the Valley championship. An English major with a 4.00 cumulative grade point average, McMahon earned the honor at last year’s MVC Indoor Championship and the 2013 MVC Cross Country championship.  “I am extremely proud of this team and our staff for preparing them to be at their best this weekend,” added Burns.  “Emily (Delvo) led wire to wire in the 800 and still was able to close in 31 to run away from the field for the win.  Kristen (Busch) and Sarah (McMahon) made the 3,000 meters honest by setting a strong pace early.  Kristen was able to chase the winner to the line for second and Mac (McMahon) hung on for fifth.  Kristen Busch, Caitlin Busch, Whitney Schumacher and Lauren Friese all ran personal bests in the race.  We will back off a bit this week and recover before ramping up for the outdoor season." In the mile, sophomore Rachel Sudbury (Tomahawk, Wis./Tomahawk) opened the day with an 11th-place finish at 5:17.21.  Sudbury also teamed with Delvo, junior Kyela Specht (Munster, Ind./Munster) and freshman Casey Kramer (Yorkville, Ill./Yorkville) to break the school record in the 4x400 meter relay to wrap up the Valley Championship.  The group broke the1986 school record of 3:59.98 with an effort of 3:58.33 Sunday. The Braves will open the outdoor track and field season March 22 at the Cougar Classic in Edwardsville, Ill.
