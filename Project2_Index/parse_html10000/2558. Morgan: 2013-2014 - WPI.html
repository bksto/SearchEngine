WPI graduate student Ross Lagoy has received the 2014 Teaching Assistant of the Year Award, which recognizes the contributions graduate students make to the quality and success of WPI’s undergraduate curriculum. Lagoy, a PhD candidate in biomedical engineering, was selected unanimously out of eight candidates for his dedication to student learning, innovative approaches to teaching, and contributions to new course development. Lagoy received enthusiastic nominations from both students and faculty members. Students praised Lagoy for his generosity, approachability, and technical knowledge. They also noted his ability to help them learn by providing clear explanations and asking meaningful questions, with one student stating that when lost in class, Ross “would make me see the light.” WPI biomedical engineering faculty members Kristen Billiar and Dirk Albrecht describe Lagoy as someone who has an eye for detail, plans ahead, and turns vague ideas into effective assessments. They credit him as being a full partner in the development and delivery of the courses he supported, including helping to develop a new lab component of a course that became the overwhelming highlight for students.
