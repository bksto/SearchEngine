Add in an opportunity to have some great photos taken in our photo booth, a chance to chat with representatives from Kaplan and Jostens. Last year featured dance competitions and lots of laughter. And don’t forget about the hourly prize drawings! Check out photos from last year’s BBQ to get a glimpse of all the fun.   This event is all about celebrating the fact that you’ve made it! Bring your friends (students from any year can attend) and join us.   Thursday, April 23 11 a.m. – 2 p.m. Golleher Alumni House (across from the TSU and the State College Parking Structure) Student Programming Events Grad BBQ Student Alumni Ambassadors Grad Trip to Europe Dinner for 12 Titans Homecoming   This site is maintained by the Alumni Relations.
