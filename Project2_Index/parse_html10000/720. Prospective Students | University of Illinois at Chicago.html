The only way to really know if UIC is right for you is by visiting our campus, walking through the dorms and facilities, and meeting students and faculty. Choose a weekday or a Saturday visit, on your own or as part of a group. Or come during our scheduled preview days for freshmen, transfer students, and students in health sciences. We'll do everything we can to accommodate you. For more information, see our Visit Campus website.
