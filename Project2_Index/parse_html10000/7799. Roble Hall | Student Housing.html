The elegant, Beaux-Arts building carries the Spanish name for the valley oak trees that dot the Stanford campus. This four-class residence hall serves approximately 308 students, many of them freshmen. When Roble Hall was completely renovated in 2005-2006, Stanford conserved its original and unique interior and exterior architectural features while updating the infrastructure and living spaces to 21st century standards. Dining is in the adjacent Lakeside dining commons which also serves Lagunita Court. The building is three stories high and has four wings: A, B, C & M (middle). A Beaux Arts Beauty When it opened in 1918, Roble Hall was hailed as “one of the most modern and best equipped dormitories in the United States.” An architecturally unique structure, the exterior walls are built of hollow clay tiles, with intricately carved columns framing the entrance.  Roble was built to house women, and its original lounge had chairs with blue and pink bows. It has now been co-ed for several decades. During Roble Hall’s $17 million renovation during the summers of 2005 and 2006, workers discovered an historic photo of a young man in the wall between a kitchenette and student room 153. An inscription read “Janet, Night and Day, Justin,” perhaps a reference to Cole Porter’s famous 1932 song, “Night and Day.” Four original Corinthian column capitals which had been abandoned in the basement of B wing were also found.
