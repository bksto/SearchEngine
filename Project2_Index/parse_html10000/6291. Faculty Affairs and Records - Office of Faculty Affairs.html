It is our goal to administer academic employment processes effectively and efficiently and to serve as a resource for faculty and academic student employees throughout their Cal State Fullerton careers. FAR coordinates the following academic employee processes: Retention, Tenure, and Promotion (RTP); Temporary Faculty (Lecturer) Evaluations; Post-Tenure Review; Range Elevation; Student Opinion Questionnaires (SOQs); Sabbatical Leaves; and Campus-wide orientations for Academic Student Employees (TAs, GAs, ISAs). FAR is the official repository for documents and correspondence concerning full-time faculty, and has the responsibility for retaining documentation pertaining to employment, reappointment, tenure, promotion, and the evaluation of faculty performance. FAR also works in collaboration with the Faculty Development Center and HRDI to provide faculty with support for successful academic careers.
