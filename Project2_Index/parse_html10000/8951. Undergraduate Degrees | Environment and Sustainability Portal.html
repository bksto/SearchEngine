The Agricultural Economics and Management program puts students in touch with the world's most critical resources, such as land, people, food, and water. The program provides options to focus on either business management or agricultural economics -- preparing undergraduates for exciting careers in the United States or abroad. Related Department(s): Agricultural and Resource Economics, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Agricultural Technology Management and Education This program provides course work in the basic sciences, technical agriculture, teaching principles and techniques, and communication skills. Students may choose an option in agricultural technology management or teaching. The agricultural technology management option prepares students for careers in agribusiness and farming technology. The teaching option prepares students as secondary school or community college teachers. It meets requirements for Arizona secondary school certification in agricultural education and general science. Related Department(s): Agricultural Education, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Anthropology Anthropology is the study of modern humans, their ancestors, and closest relatives (non-human primates). Biological anthropologists study the evolution of humans and other primates and modern human populations. Archaeologists trace the evolution of culture over the past three million years, analyzing ancient environments and modern material culture. Linguistic anthropologists are interested in the relationships between language, culture, society, and the individual. Related Department(s): School of Anthropology, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences Architecture Architecture is an interdisciplinary field. It requires a comprehensive general education and an understanding of history and culture, physical environments and building technology combined with skill in drawing, design, math, and computer modeling. Architects concern themselves with the structure, materials, function, safety, cost, and environmental impact of their buildings. The scope of their work varies considerably: an architect may design an entire community, a building complex, an individual structure, or the smallest details of interior space. Related Department(s): School of Architecture, College of Architecture, Planning and Landscape Architecture Biology The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology provides general and professional education for those intending to pursue graduate study or for those planning a career in fields where training in basic or applied organismic, evolutionary, and environmental biology is necessary or desirable. Courses are offered in population, community, and physiological ecology; behavior; population theory; biogeography; natural history; genetics; systematics; morphology; and evolution. A BS and minor in general biology are offered. Related Department(s): Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, College of Science Biosystems Engineering Biosystems engineers use engineering, math, and biology to design systems to manage soil and water resources and to design and develop biological and biomedical products. They work on projects involving wise use of energy, materials, biochemicals, and recyclable wastes. They combine technical knowledge, computer techniques, and control systems for a deeper understanding of agriculture and biology -- knowledge which someday may be used to design life support systems for colonies on other planets. Students may specialize in water resource engineering or biological engineering. Related Department(s): Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Chemical Engineering Chemical engineers are the link between science, math, and societal needs. They design processes for new materials, fuels, and consumer goods. Chemical engineers are interested in how chemicals react, how products are separated and purified, how fuels and energy are transported, and how a process can be made safe and economical. This degree opens the door to medical, law, and business school, as well as graduate school in engineering. Related Department(s): Chemical and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering Civil Engineering Civil engineers design, construct, manage, and maintain physical facilities buildings, bridges, roads, tunnels, dams, power plants, and systems for water treatment, and waste disposal. Study includes fundamental instruction in math, physics, and chemistry as applied to civil engineering. Other courses include fluid mechanics, hydrology, soils, transportation, and computers. Related Department(s): Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, College of Engineering Ecology and Evolutionary Biology The program focuses on the history, development, and interaction of living organisms on this planet. Majors study species evolution, the effect of environmental pressures on evolution, patterns of biological diversity, and species interaction within a given ecosystem. Degree programs within the department offer different levels of concentration. The BS prepares students for graduate study in the field and offers course work in population, community and physiological ecology, behavior, population theory, biogeography, natural history, genetics, systematics, morphology, and evolution. Related Department(s): Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, College of Science Environmental and Water Resource Economics The impact of economic activity on the quality of our environment will be a major public issue in the coming decades. This major prepares students for public and private positions in natural resource and environmental management. Students receive training in the economic, social, and physical aspects of environmental problems. Students in this major are encouraged to minor in a complementary field such as political science, watershed management, or soil and water science.
