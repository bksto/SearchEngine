Research performed within the EESS department aims to characterize and model the fundamental dynamics of the climate system to predict its response to anthropogenic forcing and to provide avenues for mitigation. Learn more Defining Changes in Global Elemental Cycles From major elements such as carbon and nitrogen to trace elements such as arsenic and uranium, faculty and students in the EESS department study the biological, chemical, and physical processes driving their cycling through land systems (including soils, lakes, streams, and groundwater), oceans, and atmosphere. Learn more Deciphering and Forecasting Land Use Change Land change science has emerged as a fundamental component of global environmental change and sustainability research. This interdisciplinary field seeks to understand the dynamics of land cover and land use. Learn more Resolving Ocean & Ecosystem Response to Global Change The environment is constantly changing and these changes, natural or man made, may have severe repercussions on the health of the earth's ecosystems. The EESS department studies if and how these ecosystems adapt and evolve in response to these external pressures. Learn more Determining Sustainable Land and Water Practices The earth resources that feed and shelter populations are limited, coveted and precious. The EESS department researches the best practices such that future generations may enjoy the same benefits from the earth's ecosystems that we do today. Learn more Climate System Dynamics Contaminant and Nutrient Cycling Land Use Change Ocean & Ecosystem Response Sustainable Food and Water Welcome to EESS Our goal is to understand, predict, and respond to human-caused and natural environmental change at local to global scales. To take on this challenge, we strive to investigate the complexity of the global system, including the interactions, synergies, and feedbacks that link the oceans, atmosphere, land surfaces, and freshwater systems. Through the graduate and undergraduate programs, we will train a new generation of scientists that comprehend the multiple facets of environmental processes. Learn more.

But Noah Diffenbaugh says the causes of the drought are "very complex, with multiple components." December 9, 2014 Scientists Track Down Serious Methane Leaks In Natural Gas Wells A new study that aims to pinpoint the source of natural gas leaks from wells looks solid and addresses a major problem associated with fracking, says Rob Jackson. December 10, 2014 Rains to provide short-term relief for California drought, says Stanford researcher Stanford researcher Daniel Swain said the upcoming rainstorms this week – among the largest in recent years – will provide a short-term respite to California's drought, by far the state's most intense in the historical record. The rain will be good for ecosystems, salmon runs and reservoirs. November 20, 2014 Urban agriculture on the rise A new study by Eric Lambin finds that the land in and around cities are increasingly becoming important centers of food production worldwide.

As you may have guessed from my greeting, I am writing this message to you from China. My travels initially brought me to Beijing where I studied Mandarin for a few weeks and met with fellow researchers at Peking University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I have since moved westward to my field site in Zhangye where I am studying sustainable water management for irrigated agriculture.   1 of 4 ›› Environmental Earth System Science 473 Via Ortega, Rm 140 Stanford University Stanford, CA 94305-4216 © Stanford University.
