You are embarking on one of the most important and exciting journeys of your life! Financial Support All Bauer College of Business Ph.D. programs offer a generous package of financial support to accepted applicants who agree to take on the half-time responsibilities of Graduate Assistant. Depending on a student's particular circumstances, these packages can provide a student with a total up to $36,000 per year of financial support. There are 5 possible sources of financial support provided to Bauer Doctoral students: Instructional Assistantships (including health insurance) University-Sponsored Graduate Tuition Fellowship (GTF) University-sponsored Presidential Fellowships Bauer Doctoral Fellowships Teaching Instructional Assistantships Who gets awarded an Instructional Assistantship? All students accepted for any Bauer PhD program unless your application states that you are not requesting financial aid. Students who are enrolled full-time. Full-time enrollment requires nine credit hours of coursework in the fall and spring semesters, and no fewer than six hours of coursework during the summer. Students who maintain a 3.0 GPA will have their Instructional Assistantships renewed every academic year. When do I start? How much will I earn? When do I get paid? You start work as an Instructional Assistant at the beginning of your first Fall semester at Bauer. The basic stipend for a 20-hour per week half-time appointment is $2250 per month based on a 12-month year. This works out to be a stipend of $27,000 per annum. As a part of your assistantship, you will also receive an additional $150 per month stipend to help cover health insurance. You will be paid monthly, and your appointment is renewable, assuming satisfactory performance. You will be expected to be available in the department that houses your Ph.D. program one week prior to the beginning of the semester. Is there any fine print regarding the Instructional Assistantship? YES. Please read the following very carefully. A student accepting an appointment as an Instructional Assistant cannot participate in any other form of paid employment during the nine-month academic year. Failure to abide by this regulation may result in the loss of your financial support and may be a violation of visa requirements for foreign nationals. Those without visa restrictions are, however, free to accept paid employment during any summer, although you will not receive tuition reimbursed or a monthly stipend for that summer (June to August). In addition, all students must demonstrate English Proficiency. See information specifically for International Students. University-Sponsored Graduate Tuition Fellowship (GTF). Do I have to apply for the Graduate Tuition Fellowship? NO. Your appointment as an Instructional Assistant will also qualify you for the Graduate Tuition Fellowship (GTF). This fellowship will reimburse you for the cost of 9 hours of in-state tuition per semester and up to 6 credit hours of in-state tuition in the summer, paid at the graduate student credit hour rate. The Bauer College attempts (but cannot guarantee) to provide this fellowship to all doctoral students in good standing for up to five years (the maximum time allowed to complete the program). Students typically still owe approximately $1,000 per semester in fees that this fellowship does not cover. Receipt of the tuition fellowship also qualifies all non-residents for in-state tuition. Who gets awarded the University-Sponsored Graduate Tuition Fellowship? To be eligible, a doctoral student must: Be in good academic standing Be enrolled full time in a Bauer College doctoral program Be employed by the Bauer College in a 50% FTE assistantship; employment (on or off campus) beyond the assistantship is prohibited. A violation of this restriction will result in the GTF being revoked immediately Be nominated for the fellowship by the Department Doctoral Coordinator within his/her major area. Continued eligibility for this fellowship will be contingent upon meeting the fellowship eligibility criteria. Is there any fine print regarding the GTF? YES. Please read the following very carefully. As per the tuition reimbursement policy of the State of Texas, the University of Houston charges non-resident tuition rates to all doctoral students, regardless of resident status, who have 100 or more doctoral semester credit hours. If your progress requires that you take more than 99 hours, you will be subject to tuition payments at the out-of-state rate and will most likely have exhausted all your eligibility for tuition fellowships. Thus, it is critical that you work closely with your faculty advisors to complete your studies in fewer than 100 doctoral credit hours. University-sponsored Presidential Fellowships Do I have to apply for this fellowship? No. All eligible students accepted for admission will be automatically be considered for this fellowship. If awarded, this fellowship pays an additional $2,000 per year for a student's first two years. Who gets awarded the Presidential Fellowship? The purpose of the Fellowship is to improve the Bauer Collegeâ€™s competitiveness with other prestigious business schools. As such, accepted students will normally be nominated for the Fellowship if they have: A score above 640 on the GMAT or above 1250 on the GRE A cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.5 or higher on a 4.0 point scale in their most recently completed 60 hours of coursework Three letters of recommendation, all of which provide unequivocal positive assessments Bauer Doctoral Fellowships This fellowship is awarded by the Bauer College to selected applications based on their academic potential and promise. Selected applicants can receive $1,500 per year for the first two years. Teaching Many students supplement their base stipends with additional compensation for teaching (typically beginning in the third year of study). However, programs within the college differ in terms of how much students are expected and/or allowed to teach. Please contact your department PhD Coordinator to discuss this option more completely. International Students When you arrive in Houston International students cannot register for classes without checking in with a representative of the International Student and Scholar Services Office. Please carry the following proof of legal visa status, including passport, visa, I-94 card, all I-20 forms (F visa holders), all DS-2019 forms (J visa holders) and I-797 Approval Notice, if applicable. Check-in Dates are posted on the ISSSO web site at: http://www.issso.uh.edu/arrivalinfo/index.html Additional check-in dates will be announced during the summer. For questions, please contact Anita Gaines, Director of International Student and Scholar Services Office at againes@uh.edu or call her at 713-743-5071. Resources for International Students: The University of Houston has a very vibrant international student community. The Office of International Student and Scholar Services (http://www.uh.edu/oisss/) has a number of useful resources for international students. Please review these essential resources to ease your transition into the United States. How do I demonstrate English Proficiency? Note: Students who have completed a baccalaureate at a regionally accredited U.S. institution are considered to have demonstrated English Proficiency, and are not required to take an English proficiency exam. First-year Instructional Assistants from a non-native English speaking country are required to demonstrate proficiency in spoken English by successfully passing the SPEAK or TSE examination during the first semester. Students are encouraged to engage in intensive spoken English studies in the months ahead in preparation for these tests and for future teaching duties at the University of Houston. Students who fail to pass this examination may no longer be qualified to receive a tuition fellowship, and may lose their financial support at the end of the second semester Cost for either examination or any additional English language study is the responsibility of the student. A review of the progress of all Instructional Assistants will be made at the end of each semester to determine eligibility for continued support. What our students say about us Sonja Prokopec University of Houston Ph.D. program in Marketing encourages students to pursue original and impactful academic research, and to think and act like aspiring scholars. The support of the world-class research faculty provides an ideal environment to develop interesting research ideas while at the same time fostering intellectual rigor. What I really appreciated was the encouragement and kindness of the faculty members at the Marketing Department â€“ they treat students as colleagues from the first day. I have fond memories of my time there and take time to visit my former mentors and professors as often as I can. Learn more about Sonja Prokopec at the ESSEC web site. â€“Sonja Prokopec Associate Professor ESSEC, Paris Tharindra Ranasinghe The accounting doctoral program at Bauer trains you rigorously and provides you with ample opportunities and resources to become a successful accounting scholar. Bauerâ€™s coursework strongly emphasizes on both empirical and analytical accounting research and allows you to develop an understanding of the discipline that is both broad and deep. The faculty is diverse and well recognized in their respective research areas. They are very approachable and willing to work with doctoral students on research projects. The department holds an active workshop series where reputed external scholars present their latest work. This workshop series, in which doctoral students are encouraged to actively participate in, exposes them to the cutting edge accounting research. The leadership is extremely supportive of the PhD program in ensuring that students are supported with ample resources and opportunities to present their work at conferences. Located in a one of the most internationally diverse, economically vibrant, and affordable cities in the USA, the accounting doctoral program at Bauer enables you to accomplish your academic ambitions while enjoying an enriching student life. Ranasinghe graduated with a Bauer Ph.D. in Accounting in 2012. Learn more about Tharindra Ranasinghe at Singapore Management University's web site. â€“Tharindra Ranasinghe Assistant Professor Singapore Management University Son (Sonny) Lam The Ph.D. program in marketing at the University of Houston is unique in many ways. The faculty members are genuinely invested in doctoral students. They adopt an open door policy, so during my program, I had the luxury of interacting with them very often. The Ph.D. students are very collegial. Our friendship extends beyond the Ph.D. program. The marketing department at Bauer has always been one of the most productive in many substantive areas. The department also runs Friday seminars and an annual doctoral student consortium, which offer its doctoral students valuable networking opportunities with outstanding researchers and cohorts from other universities. I feel very privileged to have earned my Ph.D. in Marketing from Bauer College of Business. Learn more about Son (Sonny) Lam at the University of Georgia's web site. â€“Son (Sonny) Lam Associate Professor University of Georgia Zachary Hall If I could sum up my experience my Bauer Doctoral experience, I would do so in one word, empowering. Through guidance of faculty, I was empowered to choose my coursework, research topics, and even how to teach my classes. While this led to much frustration and many failures early in the program, I was able to develop my own identity as an academic very early in my career. As a result, I found a true passion for research, particularly for topics I never thought I would enjoy. This brings me to my advice to current and future doctoral students is, choosing the safe route very dangerous. For example, when I was a 1st year student, I was empowered to lead my own research project based on my paper in a seminar class. I had a choice: (a) I could take the safe route of study for my qualifying exam as all the other students were doing or (b) the risky route of beginning a research project that would take up most of my time for the next year. If I would have chosen (a), I would have likely added 1-2 years on my PhD program and missed out on a few publications. Learn more about Zachary Hall at Texas Christian University's web site. â€“Zachary Hall Assistant Professor Texas Christian University Bingxin Li I joined the PhD program of Finance Department at Bauer College of Business in 2007. With a physics background, I am especially grateful the Finance Department offers systematic PhD courses that helped me to form my knowledge foundation and gradually build up my intuition for future research. I also benefit a lot from the weekly seminar and colloquium, which share research progresses and encourage discussion. The faculty at Finance department are strong both in their research abilities and advising students. They are productive, insightful, and always willing to help. I greatly appreciate that they set high standards for PhD students. While I struggled and eventually solved the problem, I learned and was inspired to approach excellence. During my PhD study, I gained not only valuable knowledge and skills, but also passion and confidence in research. Learn more about Bingxin Li at West Virginia University's web site. â€“Bingxin Li Assistant Professor West Virginia University Rachel Sturm I feel privileged to have earned my doctorate in Business Administration from C. T. Bauer College of Business. The Bauer doctoral program has enriched my life in so many ways, not only academically and professionally, but also personally as well with great friendships. I am thankful for all that I learned in the program, especially the training I received to have a successful career in higher education. Since graduating, I have been able to apply the knowledge learned and the skills that have been developed to my new job as an Assistant Professor at a university in the Midwest. I have been well prepared for this new position in my career and am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead. Learn more about Rachel Sturm at Wright State University's web site. â€“Rachel Sturm Assistant Professor Wright State University Faiza Khoja The Ph.D. program in Management at UH was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences for me. In addition to the academic rigor supported by experienced and qualified faculty, the program taught me valuable life lessons â€” to stay committed, focused, and organized. It provided me with several opportunities to self-learn and explore varying topics of interest. In my current position as Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs at the University of Houston-Downtown, I encounter new challenges and learning almost on a daily basis. The knowledge and training I received in the Ph.D. program is allowing me to address and cope efficaciously in my professional career. I am proud to be a graduate of this prestigious program. Learn more about Faiza Khoja at University of Houston-Downtown's web site. â€“Faiza Khoja Associate Professor University of Houston-Downtown JÃ©Anna Abbott When deciding between PhD programs, I was searching for both rigor and collegiality. I found both at the Bauer College of Business. The doctoral program is challenging yet supportive. I never stopped working: reading, thinking and writing â€¦ enjoying every minute. But, itâ€™s the people, faculty and fellow students that made the difference. I had the opportunity to work with highly accomplished and dedicated faculty while studying alongside some of the most supportive individuals I have ever known. This shared commitment gave me strong research capabilities and a fantastic network of friends. The Ph.D. program at Bauer literally transformed my life. Everyone cared about me as both a student and human being, and left me with a far broader intellectual perspective. Presently, I am a professor at the Conrad N. Hilton College, and Ombudsperson for the University of Houston. I consistently publish in top tier journals and engage in state of the art research in the hospitality industry. My experience at the Bauer College of Business provided me with the tools to flourish as a top researcher at a tier one-research university. Learn more about JÃ©Anna Abbott at University of Houston's web site. â€“JÃ©Anna Abbott Professor University of Houston Zeyun Chen I joined the PhD program in Accounting at University of Houston in August 2004 and was among the first of the students to go through the entire of the completely revamped program. I studied under a new regime â€“ one that provides much more rigorous research training. The program has considerable research strengths in analytical and empirical paradigms, so I took advantage of it and learned to seek sound theoretical foundation for empirical tests. I was fortunate to have had opportunities to work with many faculty while studying in the program. Some of them have become co-authors on research projects and others are good friends and mentors. UH holds a Bauer Accounting Research Conference every year, which exposes PhD students to top researchers in the field. It offers a great opportunity for learning as well as networking and I really enjoyed its exciting and fostering research environment. Chen graduated with a Bauer Ph.D. in Accounting in 2009. Learn more about Zeyun Chen at the University of Colorado, Boulder website. â€“Zeyun Chen Assistant Professor University of Colorado, Boulder Jeff Boichuk Bauer is a great place to earn a doctorate in marketing. No matter your area of interest (CB, quant, or strat), UH has a strong advisor for you. Mike Ahearne was my supervisor. I have learned over the years that PhD students in our field are amazed when they hear about the Bauer experience. In Mike, I have a lifelong role model, a dedicated mentor, a close friend, and a titan in our field who is my biggest advocate. For these reasons, there isn't another institution in this world I would have rather attended. Bauer gives you the opportunities, resources, and training you need to succeed. My dreams were enlarged and realized during my time at UH, and I will forever be thankful to its faculty and PhD students for their unwavering help and support. â€“Jeff Boichuk Postdoctoral Fellow Darden School of Business Susana Velez-Castrillon The Ph.D. program has been a very enriching experience. I am a biologist and did not have any interest in business when I graduated from college. I started working and became curious about the things that happened in the lab that had nothing to do with biochemistry. Why were we pursuing this or that alliance? How were the companies we worked with choosing which projects to fund? How did the entrepreneurs I worked with decide to enter such risky ventures? Even the daily interactions with my bosses and co-workers mystified me. This is how I became interested in business, and the Bauer Ph.D. in management program has been an excellent match for this curiosity. From the start, Ph.D. students are encouraged to pursue their research interests. Some of the papers I have presented in national conferences began as class assignments in my first year, and I think this is because professors are really involved in hearing our ideas and helping us to better formulate questions and develop research. The people at Bauer are a tough crowd: always questioning your logic, asking why, telling you different ways to think about the issues you are considering. This is hard, but it creates a very stimulating environment for discussion and has sharpened my skills as a researcher (not to mention my ability to stand in front of audiences!) I am constantly exposed to the research of Bauerâ€™s faculty and also of top researchers from across the globe who attend our seminars. I have gotten to hear many different perspectives, view different methods to answer questions in management, and see how these renowned scholars have shaped their careers. The constant exposure to research has not given definite answers to the questions I had when I joined the program. If anything I have more questions now. What has changed is that I have acquired many tools to answer these questions, and am now well equipped to be part of the management field intellectual conversation. Learn more about Susana Velez-Castrillon at University of West Georgia's web site. â€“Susana Velez-Castrillon Assistant Professor University of West Georgia Madhu Kalimipalli I am an Associate Professor in Finance at the School of Business and Economics, Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU), and an affiliated member of the Waterloo Research institute in Insurance, Securities and Quantitative finance (WatRISQ), University of Waterloo, and MS2Discovery Institute at Laurier. I was in the Bauer College of Business Ph.D. Finance program during 1995-99. I immensely benfitted from the rigour and depth of its PhD course work and training. I cherish my rich four years spent at Bauer, as the Melcher Hall - where I first languished and later thrived - quickly became a home and its fellow inhabitants my family. Finance professors at Bauer School sowed in me strong seeds of both learning and thinking that were essential for later growth, academic and otherwise. The close research guidance and caring support I received from Arthur Warga and Raul Susmel, and numerous fruitful interactions with Praveen Kumar, Ed Kao, Latha Ramchand, Bong Soo Lee and others significantly contributed to my progress and hence are truly invaluable. Learn more about Madhu Kalimipalli at Wilfrid Laurier University's web site. â€“Madhu Kalimipalli Associate Professor Wilfrid Laurier University Ricky Griffin I earned my doctorate from the Bauer College of Business back in 1978. During my Ph.D. program I had the great fortune to work with such outstanding faculty as Skip Szilagyi, Bob Keller, and the late Jack Ivancevich. These individuals, as well as several other and other faculty members, mentored me and gave me great appreciation of the importance of research, teaching, and service. The department equipped me with the skills necessary to perform at a high level across all three of these areas. Since leaving UH I served on the faculty at the University of Missouri-Columbia for three years and then moved to Texas A&M in 1981. Among other things, I have served as editor of the Journal of Management and held several administrative positions. I currently serve as Interim Dean of Mays Business School. I credit the Bauer College and its great faculty for preparing me for my career in higher education. Learn more about Ricky Griffin at Texas A&M University's web site. â€“Ricky Griffin Distinguished Professor Texas A&M University Eunju Lee The Bauer Ph.D. program was a great opportunity for me to achieve my academic goals. It was structured in a way that students were able to learn various areas of their field of study throughout coursework and focus on their research areas by working on research projects. It was also a great experience working with Bauer faculty during my Ph.D. studies. They were very research active and tried to help students develop skills for research and teaching. I remember whenever I became frustrated with the lack of research progress or uncertainty about my future career, they encouraged me to overcome such difficulties and keep moving forward. These memories will always remain in my mind, and I am trying to do my best to give my students the same precious memories I have had from Bauer.
