Four former U.S. presidents — Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush — participated in the ceremony, setting a bipartisan tone that James A. Baker, III, and university leaders had mandated from the very beginning. James Baker has himself defined the purpose of the institute that bears his name. “My vision for the institute is simple: to build a bridge between the world of ideas and the world of action,” he has said. “Scholars should learn firsthand from statesmen of the practical imperatives that impact policy, often times making the ‘perfect’ the enemy of the ‘good.’ Statesmen and policymakers should hear rigorous, logical — and always practical — scholarly analyses of how to improve the work they do. And students, the next generation of scholars and statesmen, should be enriched through participation in this dialogue and go on to be better scholars and statesmen as a result.” The founding of the Baker Institute represents the culmination of a long-standing relationship between the Baker family and Rice University. James Baker’s grandfather and namesake was the first chair of the Rice Board of Trustees, a post he held from 1891 to 1941. “Captain” Baker, as he was affectionately called, was also instrumental in saving the nascent university’s endowment after a valet murdered its benefactor, William Marsh Rice, in his sleep. Between 1993 and 1994, the Baker Institute was managed by John Rogers, former under-secretary for management at the U.S. Department of State. In May 1994, distinguished diplomat Edward P. Djerejian was named the institute’s founding director. His appointments over 30 years of public service included U.S. ambassador to Israel and to the Syrian Arab Republic. Under the ambassador's leadership, the Baker Institute quickly joined the ranks of the nation's and the world’s leading nonpartisan think tanks.
