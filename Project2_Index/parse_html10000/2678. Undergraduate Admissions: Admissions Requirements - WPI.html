Frequently asked questions about the Flex Path option and WPI's test-optional policy. Interviews While interviews are optional, this is your chance to meet one-on-one with an Admissions staff member or a trained Admissions intern. We'll have the chance to learn more about you, and can answer specific questions you may have regarding the admissions process or WPI in general. Interviews are designed to be informational, however information that is gathered through an interview will be added to a student's application, and it will be considered during the application review process. If you would like an interview, please visit the interview details page. Interview opportunities for international applicants are limited, so we encourage Chinese, Taiwanese, and Korean applicants to conduct an interview through the CIEE Applicant Interview Program. Homeschooled and Early Admission Requirements If you are applying to WPI as a high school junior, please plan to schedule a personal interview with the Dean of Admissions prior to the application deadline. If you are applying as a home school student, interviews are not required, but strongly recommended with a member of the admissions staff (not a student interviewer). Please refer to either the Home School or Early Admission sections specifically, to find more details regarding application requirements. International & Transfer Application Requirements Requirements for international and transfer applicants will vary. Please refer to either the international or transfer sections, specifically, to find a more accurate list of the respective application requirements. If you have questions about these requirements or any application procedure, please contact the Admissions Office at 508-831-5286 or admissions@wpi.edu for assistance.
