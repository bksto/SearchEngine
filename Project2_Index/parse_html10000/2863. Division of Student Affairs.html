As Vice President of Student Affairs, and on behalf of our whole Division of Student Affairs, I invite you to explore all that our campus has to offer, through these electronic pages as well as in person. We are part of your life here at CSUSM, whether we are helping you to register for classes or to obtain financial aid, introducing you to campus at Orientation or sending you your diploma after commencement, supporting you academically or providing you with a rich cultural experience. We are committed to ensuring that you develop the skills to be a success, to graduate ready for your professional future and to assume your engaged role in society. We are here for you whether you choose to live in the newly opened Quad, in the University Village Apartments, commute from San Diego or spread your wings globally. Our hope is that we inspire you to reach for your dreams and in the process, to seek out your fellow students, engage with your faculty and become immersed in your experience here at CSUSM. This year keep an eye out as the new University Student Union rises from the hillside next to the Kellogg Lbrary, and opens in early 2014! Join with your fellow students as our Civility Campaign grows into its second year, and be sure to get one of those cool civility bracelets. We strive to provide academic support services through the math, writing and language labs that aid in timely degree completion. We hope you get involved in any one of our over 100 organizations or stop by the Career Center to beef up your resume, or use their database to look for a part-time job.  We know that you will enjoy attending a U–Hour event as well as appreciate receiving help from an advisor. Where ever you turn, we are here for you. If you have any questions, want to chat or can’t find something you are seeking, contact us at 760-750-4056 or stop  by our office at Craven Hall 3600. And now, we have  SOAR--a FIRST STOP SHOP for EVERYTHING student—call, write or come in to talk with SOAR (760-750-SOAR).   We will answer your question- whatever it is! My team and I would love to hear from you.
