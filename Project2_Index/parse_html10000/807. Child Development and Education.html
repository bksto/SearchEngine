Administration of Justice Anthropology Child Development Child Development Center Correctional Science Economics Education History and Humanities Philosophy and Religion Political Science Psychology Sociology University Studies Nutrition Program The Chaffey College Child Development Center participates in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) offered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and serves meals at no separate charge to all enrolled children. The reimbursement received from the CACFP helps with our food costs, and therefore, enables us to keep our fees for care as low as possible. If your household currently receives benefits under the CalFresh Program; the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility for Kids (CalWORKs); the Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payment Program(Kin-GAP); or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR), you only need to list your current CalFresh, CalWORKs, Kin-GAP, or FDPIR case number on the Meal Benefit Form. You must also have an adult sign and date the Meal Benefit Form. However, if your household does not receive benefits under CalFresh, CalWORKs, Kin-GAP, or FDPIR, please complete the Meal Benefit Form and make sure you: provide the names of all household members and their income by source; and have an adult sign, date, and provide the last four digits of his or her social security number, or check the box "Check here if no Social Security Number" if the adult does not have a social security number. For All Households: The USDA defines a household as a group of related or unrelated individuals (not residents of a boarding house or an institution) who are living as one economic unit (i.e., sharing living expenses). Therefore, the income reported on the Meal Benefit Form must include the gross income of all members of your household, by source. The income you report must be the total gross income received last month, listed by source for each household member. If last month's income does not accurately reflect your circumstances, you may provide a projection of your monthly income. If no significant change has occurred, you may use last year's income as a basis to make this projection. If your household's income is equal to or less than the amounts indicated for your household's size on the attached Income Chart, the center receives a higher level of reimbursement for meals served to your child(ren). Once properly approved for free or reduced-price benefits, whether through income or proof of benefits as supported by a current CalFresh, CalWORKs, Kin-GAP, or FDPIR case number, your child(ren) will remain eligible for those benefits for 12 months. Foster Children: For households with foster children, please contact us for additional information. Confidentiality of Information on the Meal Benefit Form: We will use the information on the form to decide the level of reimbursement our center is eligible to receive. We will place the Meal Benefit Form in our food program files and keep the information confidential. Only upon your request, will we share the information on your form with officials of other child nutrition, health, and education programs so they can use it to determine benefits for those programs.
