Meet Martin Gannon The activities that President's Circle champions are of great interest to me, as I have been a long-time professor, writer, and consultant for 45 years. Scholarships, support of student clubs and faculty development are of particular importance to me. Many of our students at CSUSM are the first in their families to attend college; the majority of students struggle to finance their education. Such students learn to become co-operative group members and leaders not only in the classroom but also in the student clubs that are directly related to their coursework. Similarly, productive faculty struggle to support their research and such activities as attending conferences where the latest, cutting-edge ideas are discussed. Consequently, my wife Doris and I joined President's Circle almost immediately after arriving on campus nine years ago and plan to support its activities in any way we can do so. Martin (Marty) Gannon is Professor of International Management and Business Strategy in the College of Business Administration at Cal State San Marcos and Professor Emeritus, University of Maryland at College Park. He is author or co-author of 13 books, some in multiple editions and translations, and over 90 articles and papers. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos. All rights reserved.
