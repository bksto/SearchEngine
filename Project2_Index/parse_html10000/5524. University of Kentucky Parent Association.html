Make sure your student is aware of the risks related to drowsy driving, alcohol and drug use, sober driving, sun exposure, and personal safety. Encourage your student to make positive choices both for his or her own welfare and for that of his or her friends. Be sure to check out what's new on the UK Parent Association Facebook Page!
