At Rice, that means setting the bar high with a series of grand challenges and then pursuing those challenges with transformative contributions from the basic sciences, engineering, public policy, the social sciences and the humanities. To meet these challenges, the Energy and Environment Initiative is engaging expertise from multiple research disciplines, from industry leaders and from government officials to develop greener, safer and more sustainable carbon-based fuels. We are committed to: Driving down drilling costs by utilizing advanced materials. Maximizing the power of high-performance computing to generate real information designed to de-risk investment, enhance productivity and ensure long-term sustainability. Simulating, visualizing and modeling reservoirs to better predict their properties and production levels. Reducing the environmental footprint associated with energy production. Ensuring that Gulf Coast communities and oil operations are resilient in extreme weather. Putting nanotechnology and biotechnology to work on several fronts, including the purification of water and the treatment of oil spills. Educating the next generation of energy leaders to ensure they have a holistic understanding of the technological, economic policy and human dimensions of energy. Why Rice? Rice consistently ranks among the top 20 universities in the United States. Rice ranks in the top five for scientific impact, has a top five nanotechnology program and the Baker Institute's Center for Energy Studies is ranked as a top five globally for energy think tanks. The Jones Graduate School of Business offers a wide array of programs and degrees that serve traditional MBA students and mid-career and executive professionals, placing a strong emphasis on the vital role of entrepreneurship in developing new technologies that address the energy challenge. Our curriculum, faculty and students are multi-disciplined and globally focused. More than half of Rice students have science, engineering, and business majors, and one in four will earn a degree in more than one major. The Cultures of Energy Initiative at Rice University has received significant funding to engage undergraduates, graduate students, faculty members, and industry experts in energy and environmental studies both in the U.S. and abroad. From research to policy to the human dimensions of energy issues – Rice embraces the big picture. Rice has a long history of welcoming external partners, including virtually all the major international energy companies, multiple nonprofits, think tanks and government agencies. These partners help fashion Rice’s drive to develop transformative research into marketplace impact. The trajectory we envision for Rice Energy and Environment – ideas to impact –  is a central component of the Rice tradition. Rice founded the first research institute in nanotechnology; today, innovations in nanotechnology are fueling a technological revolution, from energy to medicine and beyond. Our high-performance computing institute is a recognized global leader, with a specific focus on the intersection of energy and “big data.”  Rice’s panoramic, 360-degree view and enthusiasm for multidisciplinary collaboration and our constant drive to apply "unconventional wisdom", make it the right place to take on the world’s energy and environmental challenges.
