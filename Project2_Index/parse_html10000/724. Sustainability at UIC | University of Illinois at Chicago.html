We were the first university in Chicago to establish an Office of Sustainability (2008) and in 2009 published our Climate Action Plan, identifying steps to reduce the our carbon emissions at least 80% by 2050. Our Office of Sustainability encourages students, faculty, and staff to reach this goal by making changes in daily behavior, academics, campus operations, and policies. To date, we've made significant progress: Courses are offered in sustainability and energy, including a summer institute; During the year, monthly lunchtime seminars given by student groups, faculty, and staff educate our UIC community about sustainability issues; In 2010 an energy policy was established and the campus recycling rate doubled from 2008 to 40%; Lincoln Hall's 2009 renovation was UIC's first project to earn LEED Gold certification – it connects to an innovative multi-building geothermal heating/cooling system and uses its own solar photovoltaic panels; Future major campus building projects must be LEED-certified at the Silver level or above, and similar minor projects are guided by these standards (with or without certification); Four buildings have green roofs installed. Additionally, students can contact the Office of Sustainability or the Institute for Environmental Science & Policy to pursue research or campus project internship opportunities relating to sustainability, or get involved in active sustainability-related student organizations.
