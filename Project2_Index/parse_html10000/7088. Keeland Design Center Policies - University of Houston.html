Houston’s hot, humid environment, low lying Gulf Coast geography and dispersed pattern of unzoned metropolitan development presents designers with an extraordinary laboratory full of challenges and opportunities. The proposals seeded in the vast urban sprawl of Houston are transmutable to cities around the globe. The Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture offers its students a platform of integrated disciplines—architecture, space architecture, interior architecture and industrial design—from which to negotiate the complexities of contemporary practice in a world that is grappling with diminishing economic and natural resources; the realities of post disaster reconstruction; and at the same time, continued, rapid urbanization. Faculty and students work together in a studio-centric curriculum, supported by a digital fabrication facility. Open studios seamlessly incorporate coursework into project based learning through material investigations and applied research. Making is not simply an action or a craft, but a form of critical thinking, calling forth innovative solutions for contemporary conditions. Our programs foster an environment where ideas find form; where practices are socially equitable and fundamentally ecological establish a model from which to develop Houston’s future; and to inform and share design strategies globally.
