With the clock counting down in front of a rowdy group of fans who made the 2 ½ hour drive to host-school California Maritime Academy, the team was swarmed for the happiest celebration in school history. The Bobcats' stifling defense was again the catalyst in the victory as they held La Sierra to just 27% shooting and 27% shooting from deep. They also held the Cal Pac's leading scorer to just five points on 2-15 shooting. UC Merced was powered by Freshman of the Year Christina Castro's 20 points, but got one of their best all-around team performances of the year. Brittany Martinez recorded 11 points down low, Shelby Howard knocked down two 3-pointers on her way to 10 points and four steals, and Courtney Danna led the team in both rebounds (seven) and assists (three). The Bobcats trailed only momentarily in a game that, while never a blowout, never really seemed to be in question for more than a few seconds here and there. Over the last five minutes, UC Merced went on a 13-2 run that sealed the victory. Before the game, coach Kevin Pham said there were two keys to winning the game: want it more, and work harder. After the game he was happy to announce the team accomplished those goals. "To see how excited the kids are made the journey worth while," Pham said. "In the beginning we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to try to end the game in the first half. Because of that we made some silly mistakes and took some bad shots in transition trying to blow the game up. At halftime we calmed things down a little bit and tried to stick to the game plan, focusing on the details, letting our work produce the results instead of focusing on the end game." With the score tied in the second half, Pham called a timeout and relayed a simple message to the team: "'Just have fun out there, we're putting too much pressure on ourselves to complete the task,'" Pham said. "Once they started having fun they really started to believe they could win the game." On being a champion, Pham said his reaction was different to his expression of pure emotion after Sunday night's upset victory over Menlo. "I was so happy I couldn't say anything," Pham said smiling. "The other night [After Menlo] I was jumping up and down and screaming. Tonight I was just so happy that I was trying to savor every moment. It was a different type of happiness that I've never experienced before." The Bobcats finish the season with a program record of 14 wins, more than tripling their total of four victories last year. For now the Bobcats will enjoy the moment, but for the first time in UC Merced history, the team will look to the NAIA National Championship Tournament draw to see who they will play in the first round in Sioux City Iowa March 11th.
