I hope that you enjoy your tour through our academic neighborhood. Arts & Science is home to the College of Arts & Science (CAS), the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS), Liberal Studies (LS), several international houses, and numerous centers and institutes. In Arts and Science, we take great pride in the high quality of our two fundamental missions:  teaching and research. The teaching experience in Arts and Science is highly personalized for both faculty and students. The faculty use imaginative and innovative approaches that not only communicate critical information, but also make the subject matter come alive for the student. In addition to their teaching, our faculty are also engaged in exciting, ground-breaking research and scholarship. This not only contributes to the high profile of NYU among research universities globally, it also affords students the opportunity to engage in cutting edge research projects that capture their imagination and open new worlds for them to explore. A final exciting feature of Arts and Science is that we are part of NYU’s Global Network University. This allows students in Arts and Science, as well as students in other Schools within NYU, to pursue a unique course of study around the globe (over forty percent of our undergraduates now study abroad). This distinct opportunity allows students to challenge their preconceived notions about different cultures and ideas, to push themselves outside their comfort zone, and to become genuine citizens of the world. As Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, I am privileged to enjoy collegial and lively interactions with our students and faculty on a daily basis. This is not only intellectually uplifting, it is also a great deal of fun. For those of you that are considering Arts & Science at NYU, I do hope that you will make it your academic home.
