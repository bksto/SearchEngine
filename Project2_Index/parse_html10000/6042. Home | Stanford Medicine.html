Feb 25, 2015 Press Releases Molecule as cancer protection Scientists have shown that small molecules can “hijack” enzyme function in mice, suggesting a possible preventive mechanism for alcohol-related cancers in an at-risk population. Feb 23, 2015 Press Releases Nano-spies force tumors to reveal themselves Tiny DNA rings, carrying instructions for making a blood-detectable biomarker, can enter both healthy cells and cancer cells. But only cancer cells follow the recipe to make the biomarker.
