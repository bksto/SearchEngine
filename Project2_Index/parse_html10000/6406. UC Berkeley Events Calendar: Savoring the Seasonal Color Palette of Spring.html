Together we'll explore the design possibilities of making and applying foraged hues from surprising spring produce, and gathered flowers and weeds from the garden. This workshop will be divided between learning about the local and biodiverse color palette, hands-on experimenting with seasonal dye baths, tasting a variety of spring produce and edible flowers, and making a small collection of your own naturally dyed table linens to inspire any seasonal celebration. Includes materials, seasonal spring produce and edible flower tastings, as well as your own take home tabletop linens you've dyed with the very same ingredients. Teacher Bio: Sasha Duerr is founder of Permacouture Institute and a Professor in Textiles at California College of Arts where she develops courses and curriculum in the intersection between slow food and slow fashion and textiles. Sasha is the author of The Handbook of Natural Plant Dyes (Timber Press/Workman 2011).
