The next step is to reserve your place. To confirm your inclusion in the Class of 2019, please confirm your enrollment and submit your $500 deposit by May 1, 2015 online or by mail. As a first year student, you are guaranteed on-campus housing; however, housing preferences are prioritized by the date enrollment deposits are received. Reply Online: Complete the online enrollment form, confirming your decision to enroll. Submit the form to pay your $500 enrollment deposit by credit card. Reply by Mail: Mail your completed enrollment form (.pdf file) and $500 deposit. Please do not complete the online enrollment form if you plan to submit your enrollment deposit by mail. In early April, you will be invited to visit our Welcome to WPI site to prepare for your life as a student at WPI. After confirming your enrollment, but before arriving on campus, you’ll be required to complete health forms, submit your housing preferences, and begin the course selection process. Shortly after enrolling, you’ll receive additional information in the mail about the next steps. No rush—this information is not due until early summer. Please do not complete and submit the additional forms until after confirming your enrollment. Upon submission of your enrollment form, housing on campus is guaranteed for your first year at WPI. Residence hall preferences are prioritized by the date tuition deposits are received. Information about housing will be sent to your WPI email address in May 2015 following enrollment.     Home Next Steps Enroll Class of 2019 Profile and Cover Images New Student Orientation First Year Experience Connect With Us Living at WPI Residential Services Residence Halls Dining What to Pack Explore Academics Life on Campus Student Services More Videos Virtual Tour Explore Worcester Visit With Us Visit Options Open House Events Winter Preview Closer Look Open House Directions and Maps Contact   Contact Us: Office of Undergraduate Admissions Worcester Polytechnic Institute Bartlett Center, 100 Institute Road Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Phone: +1-508-831-5286 Fax: +1-508-831-5875 admissions@wpi.edu       Avatars by Sterling Adventures Footer Image Copyright © 2015 Admitted Students.
