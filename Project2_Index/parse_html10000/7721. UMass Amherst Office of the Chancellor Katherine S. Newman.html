Newman Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs The Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs serves as the chief academic officer of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her office oversees the academic missions of the campus in education, in scholarship, and in outreach and service. Working with the academic deans, who report to the Provost, this office oversees the recruitment of talented faculty, authorizing their appointments, reappointments, and promotions and providing resources for their professional development.  In our system of shared governance, the Provost works with faculty members, department heads and chairs, and deans and with the Faculty Senate to establish, monitor, and renew the more than 200 academic programs offered at the associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral levels that serve our 27,000 students. Also within the Provost's purview are the Admissions, Financial Aid, and Registrar’s Offices and other vital resources supporting our academic missions, such as the Library, Extension Service, and the Fine Arts Center. Other reports to this office include Continuing and Professional Education, providing both classroom and online courses and degree programs, and University Without Walls, meeting the needs of nontraditional and returning students. The university counts among its academic offerings a growing number of nationally and internationally ranked programs, leaving no doubt that our reputation is growing around the world as we strive for ever-higher levels of achievement. It is a privilege to work with such an outstanding faculty to translate our ambitious aspirations into reality.
