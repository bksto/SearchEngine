Campus Events   DePaul University Events » Event Details Login Search × Exploring Chicago and the World: Bringing Course Concepts to Life with Place-Conscious Learning (Loop) Thursday, April 9 at 12:00pm to 2:00pm Loop Campus Grounding course concepts in a particular place or geographic location helps students connect learning in the classroom to their lives outside school, which makes learning more relevant and longer-lasting. This workshop will introduce you to approaches, tools, services, and various university resources you can use to make Chicago and even the larger world part of your classroom. Faculty presenters will share how they have used place-conscious learning to facilitate the teaching of two different courses: a Capstone seminar for seniors and a Discover Chicago course for first-year students. After the presentations, you will discuss ideas and create a potential place-conscious assignment of your own.  By the end of this workshop, you will be able to: Describe features and benefits of place-conscious learning Compare two approaches to place-conscious learning Identify tools and resources for facilitating place-conscious learning Develop a place-conscious learning assignment for a specific course Presented by Patrick J. Murphy (Professor, Driehaus College of Business) and Jason Martin (Assistant Professor, College of Communication) Lunch will be provided.
