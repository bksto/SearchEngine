ACES Alumni Association Endowment A high priority for the college is to grow the ACES Alumni Association Endowment Fund to ensure programming efforts. The ACES Alumni Association was founded 50 years ago and continues to operate today by meaningfully engaging our graduates. As we look forward to our next 50 years, the Association faces new challenges as we attempt to retain the vitality of the association and the rich heritage of our college. Knowing that the future is often unknown, the ACES Alumni Association has created an endowment fund which will support our future programs. As our association prepares for the future, it is critical that we be able to respond to the needs of the college, the needs of our fellow graduates, and the needs of our future students. Funding from this endowment will allow us to sustain our existing programs and activities, but also ensures us with an opportunity to create and grow new points of connection for you and other alumni.
