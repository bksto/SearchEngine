The following giving vehicles provide donors the flexibility they seek in making giving decisions. Fund for Academic Priorities The Bauer College of Business Fund for Academic Priorities strengthens centers, programs, and departments through funding for operations and special program support. This money helps bridge the gap between the cost of educating students and fluctuations in state support. Through the Fund for Academic Priorities, alumni and friends of UH are asked to make regular, yearly gifts at whatever level is appropriate for each individual donor. Tax-deductible donations may be unrestricted (financial resources are directed to the areas of greatest need) or they can be designated (purpose, program, center, etc. is specified by the donor). Most gifts to the Fund for Academic Priorities are eligible for a match from employers. Please go to Matching Gifts for more information. If you have questions or need further information about the Fund for Academic Priorities, please contact Kimberly Fernandez, Executive Administrative Assistant at (713) 743-4626 or e-mail at kpfernandez@uh.edu Outright Gifts Outright gifts remain a valuable and viable source of donations for the University of Houston and its programs. Regardless of size, an outright gift is an effective way of assisting UH to fund areas the donor considers important. The most common donations to the university come from outright gifts, such as cash, which are received and utilized right away. The University of Houston appreciates all levels of support for current operations, endowment, and capital purposes and gladly accepts gifts of cash, securities, and certain types of property. For further information concerning outright gifts, please contact John Ryan, development officer at (713) 743-4470 or e-mail at jrryan@bauer.uh.edu Cash A gift of cash is the simplest form of giving, whether a donor wishes to support the Dean's Excellence Fund, create a scholarship or endowment, benefit an academic program or designate monies to a capital campaign. Cash gifts provide the most immediate benefits for the donor and the university. Individuals who itemize income tax returns can deduct donations of cash to the Bauer College of Business. Securities An alternative to cash is a gift of appreciated securities, which can offer income tax deduction benefits as well as savings on capital gains. Personal Property Book, art, manuscript, and other special collections offer donors an opportunity to share coveted treasures as well as benefit from an income tax deduction and reduction of estate taxes. As with all gifts, the Office of Development and External Relations can discuss ways to maximize the benefits of personal property gifts for both the donor and the College. Matching Gifts Through corporate matching, charitable contributions can be doubled or even tripled. The process is as simple as completing a standard matching gift form from the employer and mailing it with a gift to the university. Learn whether your employer has a matching gifts program by searching our online database. You may also contact your Human Resources Department directly. Mail your gift with the form to: UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON P.O. BOX 988 HOUSTON, TX 77001-0988 The proceeds from the match will be placed toward the same program as the original gift. For further information, please contact Ronnie Calhoun, Matching Gift Administrator, at (713) 743-8920 or e-mail at rdcalhoun@central.uh.edu Planned Gifts There are many ways to support the University of Houston, but when you plan a gift to us as part of your long-term estate and financial plans, you will support our students and programs far into the future while still ensuring that your loved ones are taken care of.
