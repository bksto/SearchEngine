Declaring candidacy via GOLD is the only way to officially graduate and receive a degree from UCSB.  Anticipated degree dates appearing on registration or other materials are projections only.   If you are participating in a UC Education Abroad program during your final quarter at UCSB, it is strongly recommended that you declare candidacy for the next quarter (i.e., if you are abroad Spring quarter and will not return to UCSB, declare candidacy for the Summer quarter).  This is due to the delay in receiving final grades from UC Education Abroad programs.  Please visit UCSB’s EAP website for more information. Run a Progress check or Degree Audit in GOLD (‘Academic History’ link on the left-hand side).  Discuss any deficiencies with your College or major department adviser. Graduate students: Complete your Degree Please refer to the Graduate Division’s website on degree completion.

If you have a University Center block, you must contact the University Center by phone at (805) 893-4097.  If you do not clear all of your blocks before the initial mailing of all diplomas, your diploma will be held at the Office of the Registrar until all of your blocks are cleared.  After you clear all of your blocks, to have your diploma mailed you will be required to submit a release form and pay an additional processing fee of $19.00 (Domestic mailing) or $24.00 (International or Certified mailing).  To initiate this process please contact the Office of the Registrar at (805) 893-3171 or GraduationMatters@sa.ucsb.edu.  Alternatively, you may pick up your diploma at the Office of the Registrar during normal business hours with a photo ID.  UCSB Office of the Registrar University of California, Santa Barbara 1101 Student Affairs and Administrative Services Building (SAASB) Santa Barbara, CA 93106-2015 (805) 893-3592 Copyright © 2015 The Regents of the University of California, All Rights Reserved.
