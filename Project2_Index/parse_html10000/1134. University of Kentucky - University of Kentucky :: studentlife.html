In a word – awesome! The University of Kentucky can provide you with a world-class education, filled with the possibility of new ideas and learning experiences that will prepare you for the future. But life on campus also offers plenty of other experiences beyond what takes place solely in a classroom. Getting involved in a student organization is not just fun and games (though they are a lot of fun); it's about making you a happier and more successful Wildcat. Research shows that students who are involved with a student organization are more connected to their university and perform better in the classroom. And with more than 450 student organizations, there's an activity for you at the University of Kentucky. Join an intramural athletic team, even if you’re not an athlete. Give back through the Center for Community Outreach and its programs like DanceBlue, a 24 hour no-sitting, no-sleeping dance marathon to raise money for UK’s Pediatric Oncology Clinic and Golden Matrix Fund. Living on campus makes it easy to meet new people who share your interests; UK's Living Learning Program allows you to live and study subjects and topics with other students right in your residence hall. Outside your room, you can explore dozens of great dining options ranging from home-cooking to international fare. And you can make sure you stay in shape at the Johnson Center, a state-of-the-art fitness facility; it features the latest workout equipment, basketball and racquetball courts and a rock-climbing wall right in the middle of it all. At the University of Kentucky, and in Lexington, it's not a question of what to do. It's a question of how to decide. Whether it's getting involved with student government; getting some help with your classes at The Study, the Writing Center or the Hub; planning concerts with the Student Activities Board; landing a shift at the campus radio station; or simply hanging out in the Student Center, campus life at UK has something for everyone.
