Who must complete a background check and how often are they required? A. Background checks are required for all individuals who participate in programs involving children and teens; the requirement applies to university-sponsored programs and non-university-sponsored programs. Background checks are required before an individual begins working with children and teens, and then every two years thereafter. Screening for specific groups of may require alternative, or additional review processes.

How do I arrange for background checks for staff and volunteers for university-sponsored programs? A. Background checks for university-sponsored programs are conducted by a third party vendor, and are paid for by the university. Risk Management Services in consultation with U-M Human Resources administers the background check. Click here to request a background check. Q. What does the background check include? A. The background screening consists of a review of criminal records for the past seven years in counties where credit was established (limited to a total of seven counties), Social Security verification and the National Sex Offender Registry. Foreign nationals undergo screening through the Visa screening process conducted by the State Department. Q. How are the checks administered, and what is the notification process? After a request for a background check has been submitted by a program administrator, applicants receive an email invitation from a third party vendor to submit their information on a secured website. Risk Management Services will then notify the applicant and program administrators once the background check is completed. Estimated turnaround time is two weeks. Q. If a background check reveals a criminal record history, will the applicant be immediately denied? A. No. If a background check reveals a criminal record history, the applicant will be notified and their application will be referred to Human Resources for evaluation consistent with university policy. Additional information on the notification process and report outcomes is available here. Q. Can background checks be waived? A. Yes, in certain instances. For example, many of the professional school students submit to criminal background checks as part of their field placement, clinical experience, etc. If a check is already required for that experience, meets university requirements and is within a two-year timeframe, then a second background check is not necessary. Record of the background check must be provided and verified before the individual can interact with children or teens.
