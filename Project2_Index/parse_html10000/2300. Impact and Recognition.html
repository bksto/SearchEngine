UC Santa Cruz people have made significant contributions to the body of research that has made the University of California the foremost public university system in the world. In fact, in a recent analysis of the world's top universities published by Times Higher Education (THE), the Santa Cruz campus ranked first in research influence as measured by the average number of times its faculty's published work is cited by scholars around the world. The quality and quanity of research activities at UCSC has received steadily increasing public and private support. In the past 5 years alone, the campus has received $686 million in research grants and contracts. And just in the last year (2013-14), the campus received more than $50 million in private gifts — much of it in support of campus research activities. Why is research at UC Santa Cruz so highly regarded? Because UCSC researchers work across disciplines to address the most pressing scientific, social, and political issues of the day. In pursuit of that knowledge, they are blazing a trail of bold, progressive, and fearless inquiry.
