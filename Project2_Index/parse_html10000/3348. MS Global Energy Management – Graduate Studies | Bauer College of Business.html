According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, job creation in the energy sector has grown significantly faster than overall private sector employment in the past six years, with employment growth in the extraction and support segments of the oil and gas industry reporting growth over 35 percent. Since 2002, exploration and production of shale oil and gas has created an estimated 1 million of the 2.7 million jobs created overall in the United States, with analysts predicting robust growth in this sector until at least 2025. In addition, analysts expect fast job creation in clean energy or renewable industries (wind, solar, biofuels), with some studies estimating 4 million new full-time jobs by 2013. Houston, considered the global commercial center for oil and gas production, is the gateway to jobs in the energy industry.
