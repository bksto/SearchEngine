Worcester Polytechnic Institute Academics Research Admissions Campus Life Athletics About WPI IfI Give Skip to Additional Navigation Home  > Admissions > Undergraduate Admissions > Visit with Us Off Campus Interviews Personal interviews are your chance to meet one-on-one with an Admissions staff member. We'll have the chance to learn more about you, and we can answer specific questions you may have regarding the admissions process or WPI in general. Interviews are designed to be informational but information shared is added to students' application files. If you live locally to WPI or plan to visit the campus, we encourage you to schedule your interview on campus. Due to limited time in each location, preference is given to seniors. Juniors will be accommodated on a space available basis. Domestic Locations Please click the link for the city to schedule an interview at one of the below locations.
