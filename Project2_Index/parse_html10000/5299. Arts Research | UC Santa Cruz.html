Each exhibition of the platform is a new iteration consisting of a series of mechanical sound sculptures and interactive objects that drive data mined from the internet and biometrics gleaned from the audience.   Link to current exhibition:  http://www.gaffta.org/2011/03/08/transmutations-sound-data-and-mechanics/   Project Website: http://www.sonicsense.net Frank Galuszka/Mannerist Paintings, a new series  "Making Settler Cinemas: Film and Colonial Encounters in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand."
