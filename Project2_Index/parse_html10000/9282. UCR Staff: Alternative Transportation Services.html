Alternative modes of transportation, including public transit, carpooling, even bicycling and walking can reduce stress, be more cost-effective and reduce congestion and pollution. Our Transportation and Parking Services department (TAPS) oversees several alternative transportation services, including: Carpooling UC Riverside offers benefits to our employees who elect to carpool to campus. A carpool consists of two or more people sharing a ride in one vehicle. Faculty, staff and full-time graduates are eligible to participate and must travel together at least three days a week for more than 50 percent of their commute. Participants share the cost of a parking permit and TAPS runs an Emergency Ride Home program for emergency situations that require one carpool participant to get right home. Vanpool Services Vanpools are formed among groups of commuters who choose to ride together from designated departure sites to the UCR campus. A vanpool must have at least one certified driver and one certified alternate driver. Current vanpools provide transportation to campus Monday through Friday throughout the year from Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside Counties. Bicycling and Walking Program Our staff members who walk to work or hop on their bicycles enjoy the health benefits and save money using an environmentally-friendly mode of commuting. All cyclists and walkers registered in this Alternative Transportation program AT are eligible for a maximum of 48 complimentary days of parking per year and are eligible to use the shower and locker facilities at the Physical Education building at no cost. Metrolink trains and Riverside Transit Agency buses Public transportation use saves 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline a year and can reduce household expenses by $6,200 - more than what the average household spends on food in a year. Metrolink is a regional rail that operates service on five regional lines: Ventura County, Antelope Valley, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange County. Staff and faculty are eligible for a discounted pass program. UCR offers a free shuttle between the Downtown Riverside station and the campus. The Riverside Transit Agency or RTA provides bus service to the UCR community. RTA has a large service area, with four routes that directly service UCR. Faculty and staff also are eligible for a discounted pass.
