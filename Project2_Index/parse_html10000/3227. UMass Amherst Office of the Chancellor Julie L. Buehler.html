Buehler Vice Chancellor for Information Services and Strategy and Chief Information Officer Information technologies at the flagship research campus of the Commonwealth support our core mission of teaching, learning, research, and engagement by using technology to reach new heights of excellence. At its heart, information technology supports communication which allows us to reach potential students, enhance the experience of our current students and their families, and enables us to strengthen relationships with alumni and friends of the institution even as connections become more global. Technology provides faculty, staff and students opportunities to foster a variety of new relationships and fosters new levels of collaboration with industry and agency partners. Working with campus leadership, and individual college and faculty governance boards, campus technology leaders and service providers plan and implement information and electronic communication strategy including academic, research and administrative computing. They ensure that learning management systems, classroom technologies, network, email, phone, help desk, and administrative services and systems are running efficiently and effectively, and they provide expertise and guidance in information technology architecture, policies, security and vendor relations. Information technology seeks to be flexible, team-oriented and helpful. Through a collaborative approach that appreciates the diversity of styles and ideas, supports creativity and innovation, fosters an openness to new ideas and learning, and embraces accountability for results and transparency, our information technology providers are committed to the core mission of the University of Massachusetts Amherst and enthusiastically support and advance the strategic goals of the campus.
