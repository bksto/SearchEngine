O, that dear old U of R, Whose emblem shines afar, Eternal as the hills we love so well; Where the mountains tall and grand Like an inspiration stand That dear old U of R we love so well. O, that dear old U of R, The years can never mar The memories of thee we love so well; Where the friendships are so dear That we leave them with a tear, That dear old U of R we love so well. Alma Mater history Our Alma Mater was written in 1914 to go along with the American folk song "The Little Old Red Shawl My Mother Wore,” composed by Charles Moreland, and the musical-theatre tune “He Never Wanders Far from His Own Fire." It is sung at commencements, convocations, and other formal occasions.
