The program builds upon the CSU Chancellor's Office Bottleneck Initiative. The Institute will be repeated in 2014-15. Institute Members: Dong-Woo Lee (Accounting), Ethan Lipton (Technology), Kristen Fisher (Biological Sciences), Munyi Shea (Psychology), Jessica DeShazo (Political Science), Peter Ivory (Communication Disorders), Mika Cho (Art), James Brady (Anthropology), Aminah Bakeer Abdul-Jabbaar (Pan-African Studies), Swan Ngin (Anthropology), Richard Lau (Accounting), Ming Wang (CIS), Alexandrea Park (Psychology), Lijuan Zhao (Accounting), Min Shi (Management), Haihong He (Accounting). STEM Institute (Summer 2013) The CSULA Center for Effective Teaching and Learning (CETL) received Chancellor's Office funding to offer a STEM Summer Institute for those interested in incorporating Cooperative Problem-Based Learning (CPBL), Team-Based Learning and/or Active Learning in their STEM courses. The Institute showcased ways to include technology into courses, including the use of tablets and student response systems (e.g., clickers, web polling). Institute Members: David Raymond (Mechanical Engineering), Rupa Purasinghe (Civil Engineering), Krishna Foster (Chemistry), Elizabeth Torres (Biology), Edith Porter (Biological Sciences), Nancy Warter-Perez (co-facilitator; Computer Engineering), Andre Ellis (Geosciences), Huiping Guo (Computer Science), Susan Terebey (Astronomy), Nancy McQueen (Biological Sciences), Alison McCurdy (Chemistry), Jane Dong (co-facilitator; Computer Engineering), Wayne Tikkanen (Chemistry), Xin Wen (Chemistry), and Sam Landsberger (Mechanical Engineering). Online Institute This Institute was created to help faculty re-conceptualize current courses as hybrid (blended) or online. Participant faculty translated course content for the online environment using newly acquired technology skills. The Institute features best practices in online learning using the QOLT (Quality Online Learning and Teaching) and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. The outcome of the Institute is to create faculty examples for other faculty who may feel apprehensive about what the process might entail. 2013 FLC Members: Senqui Hu (Psychology); Leila Ricci (Special Ed); Nancy Cohick (Communication Disorders); Ludwig Slusky (CIS); Lori Kim (Ed Admin); Jose Perez-Carballo (CIS); Barry Hunt (Accounting); Andre Avramchuk (Management); ChorSwang Ngin (Anthropology). Summer 2013 Institute Members: FLC members plus 15 additional faculty: Choi Chatterjee (History); Veena P Prabhu (Management); Holly Menzies (Special Ed); Claudia Espinosa (Technology); Ji Son (Psychology); Diane Fazzi (Associate Dean CCOE); Jon Snodgrass (Sociology); Carol Blaszczynski (Management). Spring 2014 Institute Members: Deborah Won (Electrical and Computer Engineering); Sabrina Mims-Cox (Education); Kaveri Subrahmanyam (Psychology); Hassan Rezaie Boroon (Geosciences); Jane Gauthier (Criminal Justice); Namhee Lee (Modern Languages); Hyojoung Kim (Sociology); Paul Narguizian (Biological Sciences).       Designing courses for significant learning (Spring 2013) This Institute invites faculty to reflect upon and reimagine courses they teach. Participants reverse-design a required course in the major, and in the process develop skills to redesign any course. The Spring 2013 Institute also paired faculty within a department to work on a single course. This process helps to build assessment naturally across a program. By helping faculty to reimagine single-course assessment, departments are in a better position to re-envision converted courses. Members: Denise Herz and Jane Gauthier (Criminal Justice/Criminalistics); James Garrett and Bidhan Roy (English); Mauricio Castillo and Claudia Villegas- Espinosa (Technology); Samantha Carrington (Economics); Jon Beaupre (TV/Film); Carol Blaszczynski and Veena Prabhu (Management); Sungho Park (CCOE).
