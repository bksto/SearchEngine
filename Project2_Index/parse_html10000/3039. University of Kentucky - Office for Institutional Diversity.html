Spotlight UK to Hire Director for LGBTQ Resources By Cheyene Miller Kentucky Kernel UK is attempting to accommodate the needs of the LGBTQ community by searching for a voice to represent them on campus. The Office for Institutional Diversity is in the process of implementing a new position at UK - the director for LGBTQ resources. According to Dr. Judy Jackson, Vice President of the Office for Institutional Diversity, this director will try to accommodate the needs of LGBTQ students and work with LGBTQ groups on campus, such as OUTsource. Jackson said that when she first came to UK in 2008, one of the biggest issues that she was presented with was the needs of the LGBTQ community. “They felt marginalized. They felt as if the campus, the region, were not interested in or concerned about their needs and issues,” Jackson said.
