Mission New Student Programs (NSP) strives to help new students make their transition into UCI by familiarizing them with the UCI campus and its resources, developing skills necessary to make the adjustment to campus life and the UCI community, increasing their confidence in their abilities to succeed at UCI, and instilling a positive outlook on their future as a student. In addition, NSP works with parents to foster an environment of community support for UCI students. NSP also provides opportunities for parental involvement with UCI and year-round resources to enhance the role of a supportive parent.

Orientation staffers rally new freshman during orientation for one of the many fun activities during this 2-day program. Orientation Staffers are a very important part of UCI's orientation programs. They serve as mentors to incoming freshman and often build long-lasting relationships with their "spoppers". Celebrate UCI gives families a chance to get to know the campus, staff & faculty, and other resources available to help students with their development in college. Wayzgoose, an event held in Aldrich Park during Celebrate UCI, showcases the many student campus organizations. We currently have over 550 organizations on campus!
