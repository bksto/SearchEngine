On the men's side, Austin Scott (Waddington, NY) and Andrew Zayac (Plymouth, MA) paced a squad that boasted a 3.43 GPA, good for second among the five teams honored. It is the fifth consecutive season both teams were honored and it is the second in a row for Scott and Tevenan. Individual honorees must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.30 and have finished in the top 25 percent of finishers at regionals. Tevenan finished 38th followed by Newman in 40th and Strangio in 82nd. Scott was 51st while Zayac was 74th. To be considered an All-Academic Team, programs must have compiled a cumulative GPA or 3.10 or greater and competed in at least five different meets with at least five runners representing their school at each.
