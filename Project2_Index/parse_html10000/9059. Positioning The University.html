Some of the key improvements include an updated visual design featuring prominent photos, a media gallery with downloadable images, better integration of social media and a design that responds to the viewer’s screen, including optimization for mobile devices.  When the Cocos Fire broke out on the hills behind CSUSM on May 14, the Office of Communications put its crisis communications plan and upgraded news site to the test.  As the University evacuated students and employees, canceled finals and postponed commencement, staff in Communications worked diligently to keep all stakeholders apprised of the latest news and developments, publishing updates online as well as on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
