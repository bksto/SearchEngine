Professionals say that today people change jobs at least ten times and have several different careers. This is the wave of the future as companies continue to reorganize, downsize, and hire temporary workers.  For most people and for a variety of reasons, working for the same company for 30 years is no longer a viable option. It’s also important to be assertive about your career, which means spending time understanding and utilizing all the resources available that will help you gain the skills and knowledge you’ll utilize for a lifetime when making your multiple job/career transitions. The UCSB Alumni Association is committed to providing career assistance to you through our Alumni Career Services program. You are encouraged to participate in these programs and utilize the career information and services available to you.
