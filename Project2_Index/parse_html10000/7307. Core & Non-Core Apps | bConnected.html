Core Apps are communication tools offered to current students, faculty, staff, alumni, and former students, free of advertising. These services provide a greater level of protection of your data because the University of California, Berkeley has entered into a contract with Google to provide them to the campus community to keep the information. The services provided, collectively known as Core Apps, include:   Email Calendar Drive Contacts Chat These Core Apps are available via a systemwide contract that UCOP negotiated with Google to meet UC Regents statutory requirements. Google Apps for Education complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the US-EU Safe Harbor agreement, which helps ensure that data protection compliance meets European Union standards for educational institutions. These services are subject to University appropriate use guidelines and electronic records policies. For more information, see UC Berkeley Electronic Communication Policy. What are Non-Core Apps? Google Non-Core apps include all applications other than the Core apps listed above, such as Blogger, YouTube, Google Voice, and many others. These additional apps are not subject to the same agreements that UCB has in place for the core apps, and, most importantly, they are not FERPA compliant. It’s important to know that information stored in or transmitted via any Non-core app is not private and can be used at Google’s discretion. Non-core apps often contain specific terms of use regarding privacy, security, government access, and support. Never post confidential information in any Non-core app in order to avoid the risk of exposing sensitive information. We strongly encourage you to read the privacy terms and terms of service for any commercial app prior to its use. In all instances, you should think carefully about what you post on any social medium and the repercussions of it being made public. Email and Data BackuP When you delete UCB email messages, they are given a "Trash" label. Messages with this label are permanently deleted after 30 days, or you may permanently delete those messages manually. Email deleted in this manner cannot be retrieved from backup. All UCB Google Apps data is stored exclusively on Google servers. UCB does not maintain any copies or backups for this data. Google does offer limited restores for Google Drive data, but these backups are not guaranteed.   For More Information from Google: Using Google Apps at Work or School Google Apps Learning Center Gmail Help Center Subscribe to Google Apps updates The Official Gmail Blog Google Apps Service Status Google Sending Limits Home About What is Enabled Core & Non-Core Apps Box Updates Google Apps Updates Your Account Account Eligibility Departmental Accounts Security Transparency Transparency FAQs Help Tips & Tricks Screen Readers Learn More News How We Communicate Tips & Tricks Getting Help Contact Us About What is Enabled Core & Non-Core Apps Box Updates Google Apps Updates Footer menu Home Credits Privacy Statement Copyright © UC Regents.
