news tips pinner portraits pin picks Oh, How Pinteresting! news Start a conversation about a Pin 4 pinterest-amy pinnerportraits Tuesday, November 18, 2014 Marcus Samuelsson: Top chef and best-selling author Marcus Samuelsson is one of the world’s top chefs with an impressive list of accolades including two three-star ratings from The New York Times, two James Beard Awards for best chef and best international cookbook and consecutive four-star ratings in Forbes’ annual All-Star Eateries. He’s cooked for President Obama, opened his dream restaurant in Harlem and is a mentor on ABC’s The Taste. Samuelsson tells us about his path from Sweden, where he learned to cook from his grandmother Helga, to New York City and his latest cookbook, Marcus Off Duty, a four year journey of learning, living, tasting and cooking, with 150 recipes he cooks at home with his wife Maya on a quiet night in. When did your passion for cooking start? I’ve enjoyed cooking since I was young. My grandmother Helga was my greatest influence and I owe a lot of my success to her. She didn’t just teach me how to cook, but to cook seasonally, with a spiritual compass, and with traditions and values that I would use my entire life. My sisters and I were always encouraged to help and do the work, not just watch. When I was a teenager, I went to a local culinary school in Sweden and realized I was really good at cooking. When you find pride and confidence in yourself and what you do, there’s no better time to develop that passion. And it was hard work. I struggled a lot because I was different. I had to prove myself over and over again. You attended top cooking schools in Sweden and apprenticed in Switzerland, Austria and France. What was the biggest lesson you learned? I learned some of the most important life lessons in those kitchens. Whether I was plucking feathers off a duck or making dinner for the chef’s dog, I worked as hard as I could. Working in kitchens is a lot like being on a sports team. You rely on each other so much and become as close as family. There’s no pressure like the pressure of not wanting to let down your family, team or kitchen. After only a year apprenticing at Aquavit, you became Executive Chef. Then The New York Times awarded you two three-star ratings. At the time, you were the youngest chef to have achieved that. How did this affect your career? I owe it all to hard work, timing and my amazing team who believed in me. So many doors were opened after that. And this was long before chefs were seen the way they are now—the inner circle of top chefs was small. But as soon as that happened, I was in, and made friends with people who will be my friends forever. You cooked for President Obama—what was it like being guest chef for the first state dinner? That was one of the most nervous days of my life. I met the president and first lady, and have since seen and cooked for them several times, but there is no greater intimidation than the first. Usually state dinners are French. But I wanted to create something that would be familiar to their guest, the prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh. I did a lot of research and used inspiration from both American and Indian cuisines so everyone felt at home. The prime minister was also vegetarian, so there were lentils, cornbread, chutneys and sweet potatoes. It was the ultimate, albeit refined, mashup. You’re no stranger to TV. You won Top Chef Masters in 2010, judged Top Chef, Iron Chef America, Chopped and most recently ABC’s The Taste, plus guest appearances on Today and Good Morning America. How do you stay fresh? I go out to eat, read and experiment often. The food world changes so quickly. You have to stay informed and try new things to be successful. Of all the things you’ve done in the last four years, what’s your most memorable moment? Opening my restaurant Red Rooster. Everyone wants to be their own boss, but what really drove me was Harlem. I love the neighborhood I live in and want to share it with people who might not otherwise venture about 110th Street. There’s so much to share here—and it’s more than a restaurant. We are a pillar in the community, a meeting place, gallery, music venue, place of employment, and we just so happen to serve delicious food, too. Follow Marcus Samuelsson’s board Red Rooster Harlem Recipes on Pinterest. What’s the best thing at Red Rooster? The fried yard bird. When I moved to Harlem, I learned how to make it and put my own spin on it, of course. Also, Helga’s meatballs with lingonberries, braised green cabbage and buttermilk mashed potatoes. Making meatballs with my grandmother and sisters is one of my oldest memories. They’re a staple of mine and I always serve them at family gatherings—everyone loves them. Where can I see some good music after dinner? Ginny’s Supper Club, it’s our sister venue downstairs from the restaurant. It’s a modern reincarnation of the glamorous speakeasies and Harlem nights of the 1920s with live jazz music. It’s so intimate that no matter who’s playing, you’ll have a very personal experience. After that, if you’re thirsty, head over to 67 Orange Street. Their cocktails are spot on. It’s tiny and intimate, the kind of place that’s hard to find in other New York neighborhoods. What do you cook at home? A lot of what I cook is in my new cookbook Marcus Off Duty. It’s a mashup of cultures and flavors which, in my mind, is more reflective of what Americans eat today. The recipes draw from meals my co-workers share with me as well as food I eat on the road and at home. I also cook a lot of Ethiopian food with my wife Maya—nobody cooks better than Maya. Ethiopian food isn’t something I grew up with, but I was born there so I’ve always had a connection and curiosity. Thanksgiving is right around the corner. What’s Thanksgiving like at a top chef’s house? Our extended family doesn’t live in the U.S. so we invite our friends, who are also immigrants, over for Thanksgiving. It’s a very multicultural dinner and probably not as traditional as one would expect of a chef. There is definitely turkey and the usual sides, but maybe the bird is seasoned with Harissa or tandoori. And the pie isn’t your average pumpkin pie. What do you do with the leftovers? Pytt i panna, or Swedish hash, is another dish I grew up with. It’s all about utilizing leftovers and making sure nothing goes to waste. It’s perfect for Thanksgiving leftovers, or breakfast. Any tips for the first-timer Thanksgiving host? Plan ahead. Do as much as you can in advance. Some dishes can be made a day or two before. Have a great playlist. Music should always be in the background of any great gathering—Thanksgiving is no exception. Make a specialty drink. Little personal touches go a long way to impress your guests. Have fun! Nobody wants a stressed out host. What’s next for you? There are a lot of exciting things happening in the next few months, but first I have to make a killer Thanksgiving. …………..

Get to know these football fanatics and find out their top picks for game-day gear and grub. Game-day gear: Oyl Miller’s must-haves Visit Andrew ‘Oyl’ Miller’s profile on Pinterest. Tokyo-based Oyl Miller is a senior creative and copywriter at Wieden+Kennedy with campaigns for Nike, PlayStation and Google under his belt. At night, after his kids go to bed, he works on personal art, writes screenplays, short films and the occasional thing for McSweeney’s. He’s also a big sports fan (and former baseball player) with Pinterest boards on everything from football to the digital sports zine Art of Competition that he writes, illustrates and curates. Here, he talks football and the game-day gear he can’t wait to score this season. If I could be any football player, I’d be… Deion Sanders back in the day. He had two killer nicknames “Neon Deion” and “Primetime.” AND he played baseball as well. Superstar in two sports? Yes please. My favorite football teams are… Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers On game day, I… Need massive quantities of guacamole and cheese related products. When my favorite team loses, I… Usually hide in a closet. If they’re getting blown out, I go for a run. The best way to watch the game is… In the stadium with a group of superfans who take the result as a matter of life and death. It’s great when a football crowd crosses over into a deleted scene from Braveheart. The coolest football gear this year is… The tech gadget I can’t put down is… My iPad. It’s at the center of everything I do. The campaign I worked on that I’m most proud of is… My favorite quote is… Game-day grub: Bryan Houston’s favorite football food Visit Bryan Houston’s profile on Pinterest. Next up, Bryan Houston. This born and bred Southerner has been on the sidelines as a radio and TV news sportscaster for the past five decades … I repeat, five decades. Hank Aaron, Joe Namath and Mary Lou Retton are just a few of the many sports legends he’s interviewed in his career. He’s an LSU football fanatic and a big supporter of high school football. When his head isn’t in the game, he enjoys photography, food and music (ask him to do his Neil Young impression). Here, he talks football and game-day grub sooo good it’ll make the crowd go wild. If I could be any football football player, I’d be… Peyton Manning. He’s a classy hall-of-famer. After his playing days are done, he has a bright future in broadcasting or coaching. My favorite football team is… The Dallas Cowboys, for reasons that escape me since 1998. When my favorite team loses, I… Slam my fist on the arm of easy chair and yell at the TV. My go-to game-day food is… Cajun I recently discovered and can’t get enough of… Stanley’s Famous Pit Bar-B-Q ribs The biggest crowd pleaser is… Gumbo I’d never think of skipping the… Pecan pie …………..

She lives in Los Angeles, California with her husband Rick, a writer for Marvel Comics, and two cute—and of course, very well-dressed—children, Edie, age 4 and Tommy, age 3, who both start school this year. Here, Danni talks about motherhood and shares the back-to-school goods you gotta get. Edie and Tommy start school this year. Are you ready? I’m equally excited and sad at every milestone. I’ve been so fortunate to stay home with them—and feel completely spoiled at the notion of being there for it all—but as they and Fawn Shoppe grow, school is the next great step for all of us. Do you have any fond memories of when you were in school? One time I stashed bubble gum in my belly button so I wouldn’t get in trouble. It was there all day, and by the time I made it home, my dress and stomach were forever bonded. What are some of the coolest school supplies you’ve seen this year? I adore the colorful Kanken backpacks. They’re so well made and fun. Wouldn’t hurt to have some of the coolest sunglasses by Son + Daughters. What are the must-have pieces for Fall? Anything Nico Nico or Bobo Choses—they’re basics with an edge, but very wearable. What are your favorite children’s books? “A Sick Day for Amos McGee” is beautifully illustrated and such a sweet story. We also love “The Day the Crayons Quit.” My kids think the nude crayon is so funny. Favorite toy? I’m a fan of beautiful, well-made blocks. These Miller Goodman blocks are in constant rotation in our house. Along with all the Grimm’s pieces, too. You have such definitive taste. Have you always been interested in design? I’m really such a nerd for kids clothing and design. It started long before I had children. I’ve always loved great design and now I have an outlet with Fawn Shoppe. How do you and Fawn Shoppe partner, Kristin Swati, work together? We spend countless hours going down rabbit holes of inspiration like MilK magazine, Instagram and Pinterest, where we’ve discovered lots of beautiful brands. When we have ideas, we either pat each other on the back or say “that’s a terrible idea.” Pinterest helps us organize our ideas. We use both public and private boards, comment on each other’s Pins and look at collections together. When it’s time to place an order, we agonize and over analyze every detail and decision. But it’s always fun to guess what will be popular next season. What will be the big thing in your Spring/Summer 2015 collection? Can you give us any hints (pretty please)? I’ll just say that the watermelon is what the flamingo was this year. So, how do you juggle it all—work and parenthood? I’m not sure it can ever be perfect, but I try and stay attentive to whatever task I’m doing at that time. I love both work and parenthood, so I find ways to make it work. For instance, a major time-saver for me is getting up before the kids. If I’m trying to do both work-related things and playing with my children, I’m generally making mistakes. Any advice for new parents? Take advice with a grain of salt and trust your gut. Everyone has an opinion, but you know them better than anyone—you’re their advocate ………….. What’s your Pinterest story? Don’t be shy—we’d love to hear from you.

Here he talks about the importance of unplugging from technology, five outdoor essentials everyone should have and the two things you need to be successful in life. What’s the most important thing to learn how to do before going camping? These days, it’s how to unplug, especially for a family. When we’re camping with our kids, it’s a no device deal. Often times we’re in places with next-to-no coverage anyway, but we really leave the tablets home and when we arrive at our destination. The iPhones get left in the glove box. We take pictures with a Canon DSLR that we know is gonna get way hammered. After the trip, I’ll sort through the best images and upload to my social streams. Better to be in the moment than trying to post or Pin something in the middle of it all. I think this video by the folks at Poler Stuff really sums up this sentiment well: What are the five things you’d never go camping without? 1. Bandana Bandanas are super functional. They’re great to tie things up. Soak ’em with water and they’ll cool you down. And they look stylish too. I just found one from Penham Supply Co. recently and got if for my wife since we just moved to New York. 2. Timex Weekender I’m a watch guy, but definitely do not want to take a nicer watch camping, especially with kids. So I rely on a basic Timex Weekender watch with a nylon strap when camping. They’re great looking watches that are inexpensive, so who cares if it gets scratched. It even has an Indiglo face when you need to quickly check the time in the middle of the night without firing up a flashlight. 3. Sandals I’ve hiked in some sort of sport sandals for years and have never ever had any issues. When I do need hiking boots, I use a pair I got decades ago. Sandals are perfect for scrambling over red rock or diving in a lake. And you can wear them nearly year round. Just add some wool socks—trust me, it’s okay. 4. Beanie It doesn’t matter where you are or what time of year it is. Pack yourself a beanie. You’ll definitely use it. They look cool and they’re awesome for pulling down over your eyes in the morning when the sun starts blasting through your tent wall. 5. Bacon Everything is better with bacon, especially camping. Hey, I like ready-to-eat stuff, it’s all good. But I’m smuggling bacon along for the ride whenever possible. Waking up in a sleeping bag to the smell of boiling bacon is pure bliss. Latest camping gadget you love? Recently, I’ve been geeking out on Opinel pocketknives. These knives have been made almost the exact same way in the Savoire region of France for over a hundred years. They’re simple, solid, very inexpensive and just plain beautiful. They’re great for whittling, as well as cooking and eating. And they have some cool, kid-friendly models too. Folks will often paint, decorate or customize their wooden handles as well. Best camping hack you’ve learned? One thing we’ve learned over the years of camping with a brood of kids is: bring a broom! When you’re backpacking, you’ve generally got a lightweight, two-man tent that you can pick up and shake out before packing it. When your family doesn’t fit in anything less than a six-man tent, you need to sweep out all that red dirt dust before you roll it up. Oh yeah, be sure to toss some kitchen shears into your camping crates too. We use them constantly. Most memorable camping trip? A few years ago in Tahoe, my wife and I were awakened by a bear who’d climbed a tree directly above our tent—along with her three cubs. No joke. Favorite place to camp with kids? We’ve fallen in love with desert camping in Southern Utah. Places like Goblin Valley State Park are perfect because we would inevitably end up playing hide and seek in the hoodoos with our kids all day long. I can honestly say they’d rather go there than Disneyland… but don’t ask them that! Where did you grow up? Just an hour north of NYC, right near where the Appalachian Trail crosses the Hudson River. That location really provided an amazing balance between access to both culture and camping. Both my wife and I come from serious camping families. Growing up, I don’t remember ever going on a single vacation that didn’t involve sleeping in a tent at some point. My wife grew up similarly in the Bay Area, spending her summers in Yosemite. So both of us are really committed to providing that sort of balance to our kids today. We’ve made it a point to take our kids to at least three national or state parks every year. You recently moved from Salt Lake City to New York City. What do you think? SLC has this amazing feeling of being on the verge of something big. The creative, technical and even foodie culture there is bubbling into some real awesomeness and I already miss it. My favorite hangout was Guzzi’s Vintage Burgers and Fries—affectionately referred to simply as Guzzi Burger. They have insanely good grub. And if you ever have the chance to go there, always say “yes” to the grilled onions. Always. It’s also fantastic to be in New York where it seems like everyone is just excited to be part of building this new dynamic, interconnected world we’re now living in. And now I’m on the hunt for a burger joint in NYC to call my own. Suggestions welcome! How do you discover new things? I’m definitely an iPhone power user. I’m constantly bouncing back and forth between Pinterest and Flipboard. I’m plugged into some really great feeds via Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr and Instagram that I’ll quickly consume in Flipboard. When I see something I dig, I copy the link from there and immediately Pin it with the Pinterest iPhone app. When you get an idea, how do you capture it? I use digital tools like Pinterest to get inspired and organize those pieces of inspiration. When those then give me a new idea, I actually take that idea to a very analog place. I’ve got a pile of small notebooks, usually with graph paper, where I jot down my original ideas in a very journalistic way. I try to be sure to write in my journal at least once a week. How do you use Pinterest? I use Pinterest as a hyper-curated expression of the things I’m inspired by and that really represent my personal aesthetic. I actually have certain rules and criteria that anything I want to Pin has to fit into. I feel like if you set up some pretty strict rules for yourself, it’s easier to know what not to Pin and people begin to learn what to expect from you. This increases the chances of meeting folks online who are cut from the same cloth as you—and that’s just cool. What’s your mantra? I feel like there are really only two things you need in life to be successful. You just need to work hard and be cool. You can work as hard as possible, but if you’re not cool to folks, you’ll fail. On the other hand, you can be cooler than cool and if you just float around and never do anything, you’ll eventually fail too. You need both and when you have them, you’re golden. …………..

In this week’s Pinner Portrait, he dishes on healthy hacks for homemade meals and the trick to better cooking. What was the first thing you ever made? Frozen pizza doesn’t count. Banana oatmeal cookies for a yearbook bake sale. They probably tasted awful, so I feel bad that people actually paid to eat them, even though they were only 75 cents. When did you start your blog The Wannabe Chef? I was a sophomore in high school and created it over the course of a weekend. In the beginning, I posted really simple recipes like maple-curry acorn squash. It sounds fancy, but only requires three things: Maple syrup, curry powder and acorn squash. You don’t need expensive ingredients to make something delicious—fresh food has all the flavor you need. What motivated you to focus on gluten-free and vegetarian meals? When I was a freshman in college, my weight dropped suddenly and I never seemed to have an appetite. I realized I was getting sick from gluten. As soon as I cut it out, I felt “normal” and more healthy. I focused on eating only naturally gluten-free whole foods like fruits, vegetables and brown rice. When I had cravings for pizza, bread or ice cream, I bought the gluten-free alternatives—they’re just as delicious.

When I had cravings for pizza, bread or ice cream, I bought the gluten-free alternatives—they’re just as delicious. Follow Evan Thomas’s board My Gluten-Free + Vegetarian Kitchen on Pinterest. What about dairy? Without cheese, I’d have a hard time enjoying meals! But seriously, most of my recipes are dairy-free or include very little. Almond and coconut milk are great alternatives. I like the flavor, they’re shelf-stable and perfect in a pinch. When you switch things up, cooking gets really exciting. For instance, in a French risotto, I’ll swap the cream for coconut milk and add Thai spices. You have a board called Just Cinnamon Rolls. How do you spice up this breakfast basic? A good cinnamon roll should have lots of cinnamon and brown sugar, of course. Molasses, orange zest and vanilla are underrated flavors you can use, too. For a gluten-free version, Bob’s Red Mill makes a gluten-free all purpose baking flour. Follow Evan Thomas’s board Just Cinnamon Rolls on Pinterest. How do you discover new recipes? Pinterest is a big source of inspiration. We eat with our eyes first, so saving photos of recipes is like a feast. When I find something I like, I’ll make it as is or swap out ingredients to make it gluten-free or vegetarian. Follow Evan Thomas’s board Drool Over This on Pinterest. Have you created any patent-worthy food discoveries? Chocolate mug cake. It only takes three minutes in the microwave and the ingredients are simple: Cocoa powder, banana, egg and almond butter. It’s really popular in the Paleo and CrossFit niches. What’s next on your must-make list? A gluten-free peanut butter and Nutella tart with a pretzel crust. And the trick to being a good cook? There’s no trick. It takes time and practice. Take something you love and recreate it—that’s how you get better at any art (great advice from my photography teacher). As a beginner, follow the recipe step by step. The more you cook, the more comfortable you’ll be improvising and experimenting with different ingredients. Eventually, you’ll be cooking from your gut, not the cookbook. ………….. What’s your Pinterest story? Don’t be shy—we’d love to hear from you.

Since second grade, Jeff knew he wanted to be a video game artist, and now he’s working his dream job at Telltale Games. In our featured Pinner Portrait, he talks about how he got started, his design process and where he looks for inspiration. When did you know you wanted to be a video game artist? I decided I wanted to draw and become a video game tester when I was in second grade. Growing up, I was always sketching and had a fascination with computers, so my parents eventually bought Pixar’s RenderMan for our Mac. I used it to render images of spheres and simple shapes. How did you turn your passion for art and technology into full-time work? After college, I was job hunting for a graphic design position, but there wasn’t much opportunity in the field. I took my father’s advice and went back to school for video game design. With the fundamentals of art already down and a strong work ethic, I was able to focus on the technicalities of 3D art. I freelanced for awhile after graduation, then a video game production company took a chance on me and I got my first full-time position. Walk us through your design process. I do loads of research—I take photos and search for images online and on Pinterest. Then I sketch or paint concepts, model and sculpt in 3D space and add texture. I finalize the presentation in Marmoset Toolbag or Unreal Engine. I keep a process blog on my website. How do you use Pinterest? Pinterest is a great place to find inspiration when I’m developing a project. There are tons of talented artists out there, but they’re hard to find, especially with places like CGHUB.com disappearing. When I started doing this over a decade ago, an online community barely existed. Now with Polycount.com, Twitter and Pinterest, it’s easier to find a community—worldwide. Follow Jeff Parrott’s board 3d_Environment_Inspiration_Art on Pinterest. Follow Jeff Parrott’s board 2d_Inspiration_Art on Pinterest. You’ve worked on multiple titles, across various platforms like Xbox, Playstation, iOS and PC. What is the biggest challenge? I like to include some degree of storytelling in my props or the environment. Some platforms have limitations you need to work around, but that makes me a more efficient artist and forces me to be technically creative. That’s actually one of my favorite things about working in such a technical field. What are you working on now? I’m part of the team at Telltale Games. It’s always been a dream of mine to work there—I grew up playing their games. Now I design and help develop new games with these talented people every day. It’s surreal. Any advice for someone following in your 3D footsteps? I’m a firm believer in improvement though iteration and practice. Your work quality, artistic eye and workflow will get faster and better over time. Look for new ways to learn. There are great tutorials online. Once you learn the basics, make characters, props, weapons and environments in a variety of different styles. This will help you figure out what you enjoy making. Then make that. A lot. Also, find and become an active member of a game art community. Polycount.com is a good place to start. On Twitter, search #gameart and on Pinterest, search for low poly, sculpting and game art, and follow boards and people that inspire you.

And he’s not one to just sit back and snap—he gets in on the action. From the Golden Hand wall ball championship to canoeing the Kangaroo River, Luke doesn’t miss a thing. Here, he shares how he got started, his dream destination and what he gets out of Pinterest. First question—it’s an easy one—who’s your favorite band? My playlists generally consist of music from the ‘60s and ‘70s like Pink Floyd, The Doobie Brothers, The Rolling Stones, Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton. But above all, Led Zeppelin is my all-time favorite band. I’m a bit of an old soul. An old soul who needs an adrenaline rush every now and then. I love extreme sports—skating, snowboarding, BMX, surfing, downhill mountain biking, motocross and motorcycle racing. I spend most of the time bodyboarding or riding my Ducati. I get in the ocean for a surf or out on the open road a few times a week to get the blood pumping. You just returned from shooting—and competing in—the Wall Ball International Golden Hand Championships in Australia. Do your hands hurt? Yes, they’re sore! Wall ball is a high-impact sport, so after a full day on the court, I feel like I’ve been hit by a bus. And this was the first ever “official” wall ball competition. Two hundred men and women went head-to-head, determined to take home the prestigious Golden Hand trophy. It was very exciting and the vibe was incredible. Tell us about riding in the Ducati tour around Tuscany. It was a seven-day tour through the crème de la crème of riding territory, including the Futa Pass, the road used to test Ducatis and Ferraris. We stayed in four- and five-star hotels, drank Tuscan wine and had enough red meat to give you the sweats. At the end of the day, there was nothing better than sitting by the pool drinking a much-deserved ale with your tour mates. Do you bring your camera along when you’re just hanging out with friends? I always have my camera. Last Fall, I went on a kayak and camping trip on the Kangaroo River with 20 of my friends and a few essentials (cold beer and cask wine). Every day, we paddled for about four hours through Morton National Park. One of the highlights was my buddy Nick dressing up like a pirate for no particular reason. He definitely looked the part paddling down the river. When did you get the travel bug? It all started in 2010. My partner Natalie and I always wanted to travel through Europe so we packed up our lives in Sydney, Australia and setup basecamp in London, England. As soon as I touched down on foreign soil, a giant-sized travel bug bit me! Over the course of a few years we visited Iceland, Scotland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Corsica, France, Switzerland, Morocco, Norway, Spain and probably a bunch more that I’ve forgotten. My favorite memories are from this time. Travel is such a rich experience and shouldn’t just be about ticking off destinations from your bucket list. It’s about the people you meet, the unique cultures and the history you experience first hand. The feeling is unbeatable. When did you pick up photography? Photography was part and parcel with traveling. I started a blog, LDW Photography, to keep our friends and family updated on our trip. I’m self-taught, although I keep saying I’m going to do a proper course. Thankfully, I learn from my mistakes. My skills come from lots of experimentation and loads of error. I take my camera everywhere—persistence and repetition help me learn. Where are you going next? My dream destination is about to become a reality. This September, I’ll spend five weeks in Central and South America. I’ve always been drawn to locations with natural beauty, rather than cityscapes, and these are huge countries with a broad range of culture, landscapes, history and people. I’ll shoot in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru and the Galapagos Islands off the west coast of Ecuador. Follow Luxury Travel Destinations’s board Travel Bucket List on Pinterest. When people see your photography, what do you want them to experience? A personal connection. All my photos are of my life experiences, they’re not commissioned. They give me great joy and I hope they do the same for others. You have a diverse profile on Pinterest with boards ranging from Men’s Fashion to Magnificent Machines. How do you use Pinterest? I use Pinterest to research new travel destinations, buy things (which I do quite often) and just for general inspiration. Group boards are a great way to band together with like-minded people. I contribute to group boards like For Men Only and recently paired up with the San Diego Zoo on my Animals board. Now that I have so many followers, people often approach me with campaign ideas, collaborations and new business ventures. Pinterest has opened up a lot of opportunities.

Christy Woodrow and her partner Scott Calafiore have been touring, surfing and photographing the world since 2006. Their blog Ordinary Traveler chronicles their journeys from the Lot Valley in rural France to the remote villages in Nepal. In this Q&A, Christy talks about balancing life and leisure, how they use Pinterest for business and where they’re dying to go next. Tell us about yourself and what inspired you to travel the world. Scott and I are in our mid-thirties and live in coastal San Diego. My passion for travel began at an early age. Ever since I can remember, I dreamt about getting lost in faraway lands and learning about other cultures. I realized I wanted to be a professional travel photographer when I was a teenager, but it seemed like an unattainable dream. Now I’m constantly in awe of my life. I feel so lucky to do what I love every day—travel, take photos and write about it. Scott’s a traveler at heart. He works full-time for a software company, but joins me on several trips throughout the year. We make a good team. He grounds me and I bring a little adventure to his life. What inspired the title of your blog Ordinary Traveler? When we started our blog in 2009, many of the popular travel blogs were written by permanent, or soon-to-be permanent, nomads. They got a lot of press, which gave the impression that this was the preferred way to travel. Not everyone wants to quit their job and sell all their possessions to travel. People who want a family, home and adventurous life are the “ordinary” people we wanted to connect with and inspire. That’s the idea behind the name Ordinary Traveler. How do you balance career, life and leisure? We’ve found a good balance over the years. I’ll turn down long trips and limit my travel to once a month. Sometimes my schedule can be a little crazy though. This month, I’m only home nine days because of work trips to Bologna, Bonaire and Mauritius. I’m learning to juggle travel while nurturing friendships and enjoying where we live. How do you use place boards to share your adventures? I use various apps to check in at locations, but they don’t incorporate photography as well as Pinterest does. With Pinterest, I can pin the exact destination, see my photo and view all the photos on one map. This makes it easy for our readers to get a sense of the destination and plan a trip based on our recommendations. Follow Ordinary Traveler’s board Things We Love About San Diego on Pinterest. Follow Ordinary Traveler’s board Vacation Ideas Near the Beach on Pinterest. How do you use Pinterest for your blog and business? Pinterest drives more traffic to our blog than Google search and helps sell my photography. I easily pin photos from my fine art photography portfolio and those Pins send targeted traffic to my photos. If a person clicks through, they’re more likely to purchase than someone who found it somewhere else. Plus, the group boards are a great way to team up with a brand or fellow blogger. Where do you want to go next? Scott and I really want to go to New Zealand for a few weeks, and spend some time exploring the remote areas of Canada—the natural beauty is astounding! I just returned from a scuba diving trip in Bonaire, part of the ABC islands in the Caribbean, so would love to explore Grand Cayman and St. Martin next.

Yes, there are some dangerous places in the world, but you can find danger anywhere. Never leaving the country doesn’t eliminate risk in your life. If you do your research and find people who’ve been there before, you’ll be better equipped and can avoid risky situations. Any advice for the timid traveler? I always get anxious before a solo trip to a new country. For years, I was dying to visit Nepal, but on the drive to the airport, I felt scared. I didn’t know what to expect and was nervous about not speaking the language. The fear of the unknown keeps many people from traveling, but trust me, once you’re there, you’ll be thankful you pushed past that fear. And honestly, I feel more safe in the busy streets of Kathmandu, Nepal than I do in some parts of Los Angeles. So just book a ticket and go. If you think about it too long, you’ll talk yourself out of it. Travel can be a life-changing experience if you open yourself up to the world and put your trust in strangers. …………..
