Hines College of Architecture at the University of Houston remains focused on design as the fundamental activity of its studies since 1956. We strive to produce graduates who are skilled in their craft, capable of using advanced technology and methods of industrialized production, understand and respect the power of design to shape many lives, and are equipped to use design skills to be effective in the world. Set in the fourth largest city in the U.S., the College allows students to take advantage of the numerous cultural, professional and industrial resources available. Houston is an exceptional laboratory for exploring problems and potentials of contemporary society with its unique form and vitality. Studio Culture The studio culture should promote an atmosphere conducive to, and supportive of, a scholarly approach to research, creativity, and problem solving. Toward that end, the culture of the studio should nurture creativity and the spirit of experimentation and invention as a means to foster the desire in all students to improve themselves, their profession, and their community. Students, faculty, and staff should expect to be treated with dignity and respect. We seek a culture of mutual support between faculty and students, and among students.
