We hope you will explore it thoroughly to discover more about the School’s faculty, students, and staff and to learn about UC Santa Barbara – one of only 62 universities in the elite American Association of Universities. The Gevirtz School is a hub of educational innovation with world-class research produced by distinguished faculty and rising star graduate students. As you look through the website you will find evidence of breakthrough research in autism, culture and language, educational policy, substance abuse, international education and psychology, literacy, positive psychology, research methods, resilience and recovery from trauma, school safety, science and mathematics education, second language learning, strengths-based interventions with vulnerable populations, and writing… just some of our areas of distinction. We host three clinics--in autism, mental health, and reading and language arts--that provide research, teaching, and service for both the campus and community. We are also home to several research centers. These bring together faculty and students from across the School and University to investigate important questions in educational and psychological science. For example, the Center for School-Basted Youth Development investigates a range of critical questions that range from academic readiness for kindergarten to strategies to prevent young Latino males from joining antisocial gangs.  The Gevirtz School has partnered with the Santa Barbara School District to create Harding University Partnership School (HUPS)--an International Baccalaureate Elementary School. Further, the Gevirtz School’s regional impact is accelerated through several other partnerships as well, including the Santa Barbara County P-20 STEM Council. The Council’s 50 community leader members keep focus on pre-kindergarten to graduate education learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.   The School has an ever-increasing international reach. Current faculty members have on-going or recently completed projects in 90 countries, reflecting a Gevirtz School presence on every continent. We host approximately 30 international scholars each year who come to study with our faculty. If you are thinking of future involvement with the Gevirtz School, you will find that faculty and students are doing work that generates knowledge, advances teaching, learning, and mental health, and influences educational practice and public policy. We look forward to hearing from you.
