But, if you’d like to see the central campus area, as well as some hidden gems not included on other tours, sign up for our student-led golf cart tour. ABOUT THE TOUR Highlights This tour includes areas covered on the Campus Walking Tour, such as the Main Quad, Memorial Church, the science and engineering buildings, and student activities area, but also takes you through some of the surrounding areas, including: The Stanford Arts District - consisting of the Bing Concert Hall, Cantor Arts Center, Anderson Collection, and the emerging McMurtry Building (new home of the Department of Art & Art History) All seven schools of the University, including the professional graduate schools of Medicine, Business, Law, and Education Multiple student residential areas Stanford's highly acclaimed Athletic facilities Duration 1 hour Cost $5.00 per person. The fee is waived for those with mobility restrictions and one companion. Schedule 7 days a week, during regular seasonal operations* 10:00am, 11:30am, 1:00pm, and 3:30pm * The Golf Cart Tour may be limited or closed during academic breaks and holidays. Times may vary during the summer. View Schedule for details and to make reservations. Reservations Online reservations are required. Two weeks advance notice is recommended. Cart accommodates five people. Children or infants may not ride on laps. Please note that there is a great deal of information overlap between the Golf Cart Tour and our other tours (including the Campus Walking Tour and Discover Stanford Tour). We strongly recommend choosing only one tour that best suits your needs and interests.

Prospective Students: Planning a Spring Visit? We strongly encourage prospective students planning a visit to do so either before March 14 or after April 7 in order to maximize the value of the visit. These are our busiest weeks of the year, and they coincide with Stanford's final exams and our own Spring Break — large crowds are thus paired with limited offerings and greatly reduced tour guide staffing. To truly get a sense of what Stanford is like, come during an academic quarter in order to sit in on classes, enjoy smaller tour groups, and take part in special interest tours and programs. For more information, please contact us at (650) 723-2560 during business hours. View Schedule & Register Campus Tours & Programs The schedule shows availability for all tours.
