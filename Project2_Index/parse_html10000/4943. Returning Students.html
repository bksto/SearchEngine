Pre-Major vs. Expressed Interest - what does this mean for you? Pre-Major – A designation for undergraduate students pursuing a non-impacted major.  These students may declare or be assigned major status upon admission to the university or by the department/program of their intended major  after completing specified pre-requisites as defined by their academic department/program. Expressed Interest – A designation for undergraduate students interested in pursuing an impacted major but who may not declare or be assigned by the department/program of their intended major upon admission to the university.  These students must successfully complete any specified pre-requisites and a supplemental admissions process in order to be formally admitted to the major/program.
