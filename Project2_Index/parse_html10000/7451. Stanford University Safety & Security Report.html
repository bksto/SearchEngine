University officials at each of the branch campuses gather the required crime statistics annually from their local law enforcement agencies and publish reports locally. These statistics are also reported to the Department of Public Safety. Additionally, upon request, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office, the San Mateo Sheriff's Department, the Palo Alto Police Department and other law enforcement agencies provide statistics from the required geographical areas to the Department of Public Safety annually.
