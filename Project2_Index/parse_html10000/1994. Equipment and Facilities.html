We have over 100 Vemco VR2Ws omnidirectional acoustic receivers, a VR4 underwater omni-directional Iridium-linked acoustic receiver, and a VR2C-cabled acoustic receiver. We have 3 VR100 ship-bourne acoustic receivers with directional and omnidirectional hydrophones and 2 RJE DPR diver-held acoustic receivers. The Shark Lab has a temperature regulated 90 liter Loligo flume respirometer with fiber optic oxygen probe system for swimming kinematic and metabolic rate experiments. Stereo-video equipped autonomous hexcopter The Shark Lab has commissioned the construction of a stereo-video camera equipped hexcopter that can be controlled via radio-controlling station or programmed to fly transects. The stereo-cameras allow for measurements of sharks regardless of altitude or shark depth. Boats The Shark Lab has access to all Department vessels including the 26' D.R. Nelson (Parker with twin 150 HP Yamaha engines, Seriola (22' TwinVee with twin 70 HP Yamaha engines), Gray Whaler (17' Boston Whaler with 40 HP Yamaha engine) and 13' aluminum jonboat (6 HP Yamaha engine and electric trolling motor). Ship access The Shark Lab has access to the RV Yellowfin run through the CSU Ocean Studies Institute and Southern California Marine Institute. We have used this vessel in the past for offshore projects and multi-day projects around the Channel Islands. Facilities Semi-wet lab (HSCI  116) The Shark Lab is the only lab space immediately adjacent to the Marine Lab and the semi-enclosed outdoor tank bay. The Shark Lab has 4 work stations for students and worktop space for field research gear preparation and minor dry laboratory research. We have a 500 gal. (closed-system) polyurethane tank (5' diameter) tank in the lab for holding animals for research. There is "on-demand" seawater outlets and compressed air throughout the lab space. There is a separate dry lab space housing lab computers, dissection scope and electronics. Semi-enclosed outside lab space (HSCI  121a) The Shark Lab has immediate access to the 1200 sq ft semi-enclosed outdoor tank bay, which has 10,000 gal recirculating system including chillers, protein skimmers, and cartridge filters. We have one 1200 gal (8' diameter), one 900 gal (7' diameter), and two 500 gal (5' diameter) polyurethane tanks for holding gamefishes, sharks, skates and rays. Additional tank space is available for experiments. Dive facilities The Shark Lab has access to the Department of Biological Sciences Dive facility. We have 14 scuba tanks (aluminum and steel) and a new compressor and bank system.
