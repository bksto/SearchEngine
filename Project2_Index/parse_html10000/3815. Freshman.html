For information on applying to UCSB, download our Admissions Guide for prospective students below. Eligibility Requirements Attaining eligibility is an important first step in gaining admission to the university, though eligibility alone will not assure admission to UC Santa Barbara. Visit the Freshman Eligibility Requirements page for detailed information on the minimum requirements for admission. Selection Criteria When a UC campus cannot admit all eligible applicants, as has been the case with UCSB in the past, it uses standards to select students that are more demanding than the minimum requirements. These standards, which the university calls selection criteria, identify students who have demonstrated high academic achievement and the capacity to contribute to the intellectual vitality of the campus community. Visit the Freshman Selection page to find out more about these standards.
