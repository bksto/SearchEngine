How can I fix that? A: There are two things to try. 1: Switch to a basic version of Gmail by clicking Basic HTML in the footer of the inbox. 2: You could have a conflict with security and anti-virus software. Read more about how to better configure your system. Q: Can I get my mail on my Blackberry or iPhone? A: Yep! Here are Google's instructions for the Blackberry and for the iPhone. Q: Do I go to Gmail.com to login? A: No. You need to go to http://mail.google.com/a/ucsbalum.com. If you go to Gmail.com, they won't know what your ucsbalum.com account means. Q: How do I set up my e-mail forwarding? A: The process shouldn't take you more than a minute. Step 1: Log in to your Google-powered e-mail system. Step 2: Find the tab in the top-right corner called "Settings" and click it. Step 3: Look for the tab marked Forwarding and POP/IMAP and click it. Step 4 - Forwarding: To forward your email, find the Forwarding section and click the round button next to "Forward a copy of incoming mail to." Make sure to add the email address you want the email forwarded to. Then, you have to decide if you'd like to keep a copy in your ucsbalum.com system or delete them from ucsbalum.com. Once you've made your selection, click "Save Changes" and you are done. Step 4 - POP Connection: To download your email via POP, you need to enable POP. Select either Enable POP for all mail, or just Enable POP for all mail from now on. Then, you have to decide if you'd like to keep a copy in your ucsbalum.com system or delete them from ucsbalum.com. Instructions on how to set up your email client (like Outlook or Thunderbird) can be found in detail by clicking "Configuration instructions" and choosing which email client you have. Once you've made your selection, click "Save Changes" and you are done. Step 4 - IMAP Connection: To enable an IMAP connection, you need to enable IMAP. Instructions on how to set up your email client (like Outlook or Thunderbird) can be found in detail by clicking "Configuration instructions" and choosing which email client you have. Once you've made your selection, click "Save Changes" and you are done. Q: Labels. I'm baffled. Help me! I can't live with 1000 messages in my inbox! A: Do you see the series of labels on the left hand side (some of them have numbers in parenthesis)? Those are your labels. Clicking on one will tell Gmail "Go get all the mail with the label X" and it will show it to you. You should apply labels to as many e-mails as you would have kept in your folders. Labels are different from folders in that an e-mail can have multiple labels - you can only put an e-mail in one folder. Your next question is going to be: Great, but that still means I have 500 e-mails in my inbox, and that's no way to live. We agree. Gmail really only has two folders: Inbox and Archive. So if you label something and archive it, that e-mail will go in the archive folder, out of your inbox. Archiving doesn't mean that you've deleted it, it means it's in the Archives folder. If you label an e-mail "Job Search" and archive it, you can find it two ways: search for it (in the search box) or click "Job Search" on the labels list on the left. You can watch a movie about labels here. Q: I already have a Gmail account. Will I be able to have two accounts? How will I manage both of them? A: Yes, you will be able to manage two accounts. Check out Google's documentation on how to connect up to five Gmail accounts. Q: I heard that Gmail spies on messages to put ads into them. Is that true? A: No. Gmail is not spying on your messages. All e-mail systems scan your e-mails so that they can display the messages, allow you to search for your messages and flag your messages. Just as you can search all your e-mails for the word "Gaucho," Gmail can scan your messages for keywords and attach relevant ads. At no time will Google or the UCSB Alumni Association staff read your mail without your consent. Q: Help! I can't login! A: If you've tried to log in to the new Gmail system and your password seemed to fail, email us at ucsbalum@ucsbalum.com and we will reset your password as soon as we can.
