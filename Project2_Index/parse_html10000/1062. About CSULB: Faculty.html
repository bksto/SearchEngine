They create an intellectual atmosphere that encourages students to develop a spirit of investigation which becomes a life-long approach to issues and problems. The role of the university professor is somewhat different from that of the high school teacher. University faculty are involved in the creation of knowledge as well as the dissemination of it. Our expectation is that students will not only use the 145 instructional days per year to the best possible advantage, but also to reflect on the learning process and to think about how the professor came to understand and organize the knowledge presented, and thus take full advantage of the University’s resources and take responsibility for their own education. The explicit policies of the University, developed by the faculty, on grades and grading, on class attendance, withdrawal from courses, and cheating and plagiarism are located elsewhere in this Catalog. These and other policies reflect the concerns of the faculty that students take seriously the opportunities made available to them. Beyond these rules and regulations the faculty expect student participation in their education that may be different from or more active than what students have been used to in secondary schools. In addition, the California State University (CSU) is committed to upholding and preserving the principles of academic freedom: the right of faculty to teach, conduct research or other scholarship, and publish free of external constraints other than those normally denoted by the scholarly standards of a discipline. Professors, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them. Their primary responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end professors devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligations to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending, and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their freedom of inquiry. As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to ensure that their evaluations of students reflect each student’s true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom. Faculty earn academic rank as they develop their course materials, research and creative activities, academic and community service, and publications. The highest faculty rank is “Professor,” sometimes called “full Professor.” The intermediate rank is “Associate Professor.” Most faculty begin their careers as “Assistant Professors.”   Website Index A B CA-CL CM-CZ D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z California State University, Long Beach 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 562.985.4111 Website Credits Feedback
