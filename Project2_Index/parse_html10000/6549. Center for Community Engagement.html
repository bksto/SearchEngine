Service learning is a method of teaching that combines classroom instruction with meaningful community service, giving students real-world learning experiences that enhance their academic learning while providing a tangible benefit for the community. This form of learning emphasizes critical thinking and personal reflection while encouraging a heightened sense of community, civic engagement, and personal responsibility.
