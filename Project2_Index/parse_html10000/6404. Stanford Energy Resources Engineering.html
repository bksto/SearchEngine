Additional Photos How to store CO2 underground—and keep it there Peering 500 years into the future of a simulated carbon sequestration site, School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences researchers are using speedy parallel computing in their quest to find the optimal approach for injecting carbon dioxide into deep reservoirs. Learn More Scrubbing CO2 from Atmosphere While it is possible to chemically scrub carbon dioxide from Earth's atmosphere to lessen global warming, the process is prohibitively expensive. ERE Professor Jennifer Wilcox concludes that air-capture of carbon dioxide with chemicals will be far in the future.  Learn more.
