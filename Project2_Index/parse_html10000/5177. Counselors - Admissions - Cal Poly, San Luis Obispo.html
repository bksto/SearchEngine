Counselor To Do List: Create your own Counselor VIP page Ask our Virtual Advisor a question Take a Virtual Tour Visiting Cal Poly with your High School? Campus visitors have the chance to take a general campus tour, attend an admissions information session, tour housing facilities or tour specific colleges. You can also tour our campus on your own using downloadable apps for the IPhone, IPod or Android. Groups of 15 or more must make prior arrangements for a campus tour. Placing your request 3-4 weeks in advance is recommended, but a minimum of two weeks notice is required. Special arrangements for tours and admissions presentations can often be made at times convenient for the group. All tours are led by current Cal Poly students who sign up to lead group tours as their schedules allow; tour confirmation is made when a student tour guide is scheduled. Allow maximum lead time for the greatest chance of accommodation. Schools/Organizations: To arrange a special group tour for 15 or more people, please email Amy Shore at ashore@calpoly.edu.   For any updates, also check our Campus Tour Information line at: 805-756-5734.
