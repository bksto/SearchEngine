Organizations offering part- or full-time employment that requires any up-front costs to students in order to work, i.e. membership fees; startup fees; fees for lessons; portfolios or placement fees; or the purchase of tools, samples or sales kits will not be allowed to recruit at the Rice University CCD. The Center for Career Development may review job descriptions posted by any employer for appropriateness and content, and reserves the right to remove any job postings and descriptions without notice or explanation to the employer. UNPAID INTERNSHIP POSTINGS By posting an unpaid internship in RICElink, you agree to the following: “I understand there are Federal and State guidelines and standards which determine whether interns should be paid at least the minimum wage and overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act for the services that they provide to “for-profit” private sector employers. For more information, visit the Federal Department of Labor’s fact sheet here http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm and also identify and review the requirements for the applicable Department of Labor for the State.” By posting an unpaid internship you attest that you have reviewed the Federal and State guidelines and your organization’s unpaid internship meets the required standard. CANCELLATION All cancellations of information sessions must be completed in writing to ccd@rice.edu, three business days in advance of the scheduled event in order to receive a refund. All cancellations or changes to interview schedules in Huff House must be communicated directly to your interviewees, and in writing to ccd@rice.edu. ALCOHOL The Center for Career Development (CCD) adheres to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) policy on recruiting that requires all recruiting activity (including all presentations, interview sessions, and employer-sponsored events on- or off-campus) to be alcohol-free. NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY The CCD makes its interviewing facilities and position-listing services available to employers who do not unlawfully discriminate in the selection of candidates on the basis of national origin, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other basis prohibited by applicable law. Any employer who makes use of University facilities or services must agree to abide by this policy and, if interviewing students, to talk in good faith with students who have been selected for an interview and to refrain from questioning students regarding the above protected classifications. OFFER POLICY We recognize that employers have certain constraints in the flexibility they have to accommodate student needs, but we ask employers to refrain from presenting exploding offers, which exert undue pressure on students by making offers with unreasonable time limits (less than two weeks) or time-sensitive penalties.  Rice believes that students should have the opportunity to explore the options open to them in order to make responsible and well-informed decisions about employment offers.  We want you to hire the best candidates and for our students to obtain the best opportunity for them.  For these reasons and to maintain consistency with peer institutions, our job offer policy for organizations participating in campus recruitment is as follows: Timing of offer Date by which to decide on offer Offers from Summer Internships November 1 or minimum of two weeks (whichever is LATER) Offers from Fall Campus Recruiting      November 1 or minimum of two weeks (whichever is LATER) Offers from Spring Campus Recruiting      February 20 or minimum of two weeks (whichever is LATER) All official offers must be in writing. Written offers are defined as electronic or hard copies. The start of the offer timeline is determined by the date on the written offer letter. REPORTING OFFERS & HIRES Employers that utilize CCD services are expected to report hiring statistics for Rice students. Information provided by employers will be reported in aggregate form only.  Salaries offered by individual employers will not be reported, nor will the names of the students they hire. THIRD PARTY RECRUITING Campus interviews should be directly scheduled and conducted by the organization's employees, rather than by third-party representatives. In cases where third-party representatives are allowed to interview, they must disclose the client(s) they are representing, the type of position, and to whom the student's credentials will be disclosed. The CCD will be permitted to verify this information by contacting the named client(s) to ensure compliance with NACE and Rice University policies. The CCD reserves the right to prohibit third-party recruiting. The third-party representative will conduct recruiting at Rice under the name of the hiring organization. Under no circumstances can student information be disclosed for any reason other than recruiting purposes with the designated client(s), nor can it be sold or distributed to other entities. Third-party recruiters coming to the Rice campus will represent only one firm during an interview schedule, presentation, or at a booth during a fair or other CCD activity. SELECTION BY CITIZENSHIP OR NATIONAL ORIGIN Because Rice has the privilege to educate outstanding individuals of varying backgrounds, employers may encounter an international student on their interview schedule. U.S. laws and regulations require certain treatment of international students. Screening candidates based on citizenship or national origin is prohibited. While employers can hire only persons authorized to work in the U.S., there are a number of categories of persons authorized to do so. It is prohibited to ask to which category a person fits. Employers may ask if an applicant is legally authorized to work in the U.S. and may also ask if the applicant will now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status. However, employers may not use visa type as a screening tool to deny a qualified, employment-authorized candidate a position. The only exception is a position posting that specifically states a requirement for U.S. citizenship due to grant funding requirements or other specific regulations. Employers must refrain from asking interview questions regarding a candidate's citizenship or national origin, including questions about primary language, acquisition of foreign language reading skills, residency status, or ancestry. If you have questions regarding this policy, please contact the CCD.      ABOUT Welcome Meet the Staff Directions & Parking Historic Huff House Contact   STUDENTS Events Calendar Explore Career Options Jobs & Internships Career Counseling Events & Workshops Guides & Presentations Peer Career Advisors Connect with Alumni & Mentors Graduate Students & Post Docs Resources EMPLOYERS Why Rice?
