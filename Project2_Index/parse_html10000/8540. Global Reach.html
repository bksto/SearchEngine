For our students, this goes directly to the human dimension of doing something good with one’s life. Also, NYU’s global brand is reflected in the fact that NYU dental graduates practice in every city and state in the nation and in every country in the world. NYUCD’s global reach is possible because of our participation in the NYU Global Network University. The GNU allows students and faculty to gather in a set of key locales around the globe to forge new ideas, advance the questions we ask about the world, and create solutions for the problems that beset us all. The core strength of the GNU is collaboration. Part of NYU’s teaching mission consists of preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and our faculty believes that such preparation is most effective through collaboration. Our relationship to New York City -- the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs, and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty -- enables students and faculty alike to broaden the scope and vision of knowledge through interdisciplinary and interprofessional learning in order to make a real difference in the world. Student Service, Education, and Research around the World For over 20 years, NYUCD has provided the nation’s most extensive oral health outreach programs for New York City schoolchildren, the elderly, people with disabilities, and other underserved populations. The NYUCD/Henry Schein Cares Global Student Outreach Program has also built an exemplary global outreach model that provides participants with a unique service-learning experience, opportunities to conduct critically-needed research, and an increased awareness of access to care issues, while fostering a passion for volunteerism and social responsibility. Participants on these outreaches speak of being challenged to re-think their roles as healthcare providers, and describe their experiences as "transformative." Equally important, the communities served by these programs are empowered by NYUCD’s outreach model as sustainable oral health services become a reality. Current international outreach sites include Manta, Ecuador; Grenada, West Indies; La Preciosita, Mexico; Kathmandu, Nepal; and Granada, Nicaragua. Within the United States, students have provided care and conducted research in Hudson, New York; Machias, Maine; and several villages in Alaska.   NYU College of Dentistry Henry Schein Cares Global Student Outreach ProgramRead More      global research collaborationsRead More      programs for international dentistsRead More      local community outreachRead More       NYU Global Institute of Public HealthRead More Academic Programs DDS Program Dental Hygiene Programs Advanced Education Programs Master's Degree Programs Certificate Program in Clinical Research Programs for International Dentists Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE) Research Research at NYUCD Bluestone Center for Clinical Research HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP) Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR) NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB) Patient Care Become a Patient at NYUCD Emergency Services / Urgent Care General Dentistry Pediatric Dentistry Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery Orthodontics Implant Dentistry Endodontics Periodontics Prosthodontics Special Needs Program Patient Advocate Linhart CDE Program NYU Dental Faculty Practices NYU Oral Cancer Center NYU Nursing Faculty Practice Quick Links About Us Admissions Information Academy of Distinguished Educators Interprofessional Education Current Students Intranet Departments/Faculty Global Reach News, Publications and Facts Working at NYUCD Contact Us Directions Connect NYU College of Dentistry 345 E. 24th Street (corner of First Avenue) New York, NY, 10010 (212) 998-9800 NYUCD Facebook Page NYUCD Twitter Page NYUCD YouTube Page NYUCD LinkedIn Page MAKE A GIFT Copyright © New York University College of Dentistry Feedback
