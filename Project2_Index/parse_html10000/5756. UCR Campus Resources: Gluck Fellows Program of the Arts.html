Bringing the Arts to the Community As the premier arts outreach program at UC Riverside, the Gluck Fellows Program provides fellowships to exceptional UCR students, faculty and visiting guest artists to conduct arts-related presentations, performances, and workshops in the Riverside community. Started in 1996, UCR boasts of just three programs of its type in the United States, the Gluck Fellows Program creates opportunities for students and faculty of the departments of Art, Creative Writing, Dance, History of Art, Music, and Theatre to bring their creativity to Riverside County venues, such as schools, elder care facilities and community centers. The Sweeney Art Gallery and UCR/California Museum of Photography also participate in the program. The program is made possible through the generosity of the Maxwell H. Gluck Foundation, which, since its inception in 1987, has provided nearly $5 million in funding. Workshops have featured dancers and choreographers, singers, actors, poets, art historians and others, traveling to schools and nursing homes to bring the arts to underserved audiences. And with outreach events like Gluck Day of the Arts, Summer Camp for the Arts and the First Sundays programs at the Sweeney Art Gallery and the UCR/California Museum of Photography, the program continues to grow.
