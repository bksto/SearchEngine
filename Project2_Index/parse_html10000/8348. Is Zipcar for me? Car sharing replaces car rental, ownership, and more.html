I need a big car for a big job.   Reserving a Zipvan or SUV beats the heck out of renting a moving truck or asking your brother-in-law. I want to jumpstart my business.   Join Zipcar for Business.

Loading...   compare to rental You could rent a car (but that would be silly). Car rental is great if you don't mind standing in long lines. Not to mention, you're usually paying for gas, insurance and parking. But that's not what the Zipcar way of life is all about. With Zipcar, you're free from paying for all three (they're included) and your Zipcard opens the door to any Zipcar in any Zipcar city – whether you're there for business or pleasure. When considering rental cars over Zipcar, it's helpful to play a little game of "OR": Stand in line and wait for your rental car OR Skip jovially through the city waving to locals and whistling, picking up your car around the corner? Pay for gas and insurance OR Pay a low hourly or daily rate that includes gas, insurance and mileage? Race back to the rental lot sweaty and panicked to return your car before 5:00PM OR Extend your reservation using your mobile device, and then finish enjoying your dinner? Listen to on-hold music for 45 minutes only to learn that the rental office is closed for the day OR Call Zipcar Member Services 24/7 and talk to a real person? Turn on the AM/FM radio and adjust the mirrors on the four door OR Reserve one of our luxury Zipcars and adjust to being comfortable. And happy.   this idea is bigger than all of us Imagine a world with one million fewer cars on the road. We do. Fewer cars. Way Fewer. Each and every Zipcar takes 15 personally-owned vehicles off the road. Multiply that by the thousands of cars in our fleet and you've got a really big number. The sharing movement. 10% of the population is expected to adopt car sharing as their primary mode of transportation. Why buy the car if you can get the gas for free? Driving smarter. After joining Zipcar, 90% of our members drove 5,500 miles or less per year. That adds up to more than 32 million gallons of crude oil left in the ground—or 219 gallons saved per Zipster. More green space. What would the world look like if everybody shared cars instead of owned them? Save paradise and tear down that parking lot. Want to make a real impact? Join the club.
