As an undergraduate, there are many ways for you to participate in this vital research community. The excitement of research infuses the classroom, where new knowledge and breakthroughs enliven the learning process. Beyond the classroom, many students advance their research skills by assisting on faculty-initiated research. The Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program (URAP) helps match undergraduates to faculty researchers in every field of knowledge. Apprentices work with faculty as they learn the discipline essential to research --and enjoy the creativity and accomplishment of problem-solving. In every department there are opportunities for student-initiated research as well. What could be more satisfying than to draw together your classroom learning and your particular interests to design and execute a research project of your own? And there are workshops, funding, and other support available to help you succeed in this.
