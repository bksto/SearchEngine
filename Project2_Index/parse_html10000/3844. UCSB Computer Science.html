The daylong workshop of student talks and invited industry speakers was fully organized by graduate students in the department, who volunteered to select speakers, put together a workshop proceedings, and organize an industry panel. CS Professor Heather Zheng named IEEE Fellow Heather Zheng, a UC Santa Barbara Computer Science professor, has been named an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Fellow. IEEE Fellow is a distinction reserved for select IEEE members whose extraordinary accomplishments in any of the IEEE fields of interest are deemed fitting of this prestigious grade elevation.

He will receive his BS at the end of Fall 2014 and plans to complete his MS by the end of Fall 2015. Originally from Los Gatos, CA, Hunter graduated high school in 2004 before going to work at WISchip and later Broadcom Corporation. He then decided to attend De Anza Community College before transferring to UCSB in the Fall of 2012. We asked him a few questions about his UCSB experience. Alumnus Ceren Budak Budak is an alumnus of the UCSB Computer Science department who graduated with a PhD in 2012. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research New York where she studies computational social science, a field in the intersection of social sciences, computer science, and statistics. We asked her a few questions about her UCSB experience and beyond. Interview with CS Celebrity Ben Zhao Ben Zhao is a computer science professor at UCSB who made the TR35 list in 2006 and has since become a sought-after expert judge for innovator lists, hackathons and other competitions. If it’s in the realm of social networks, Internet security and privacy, and the modeling and mining of enormous graphs, you can bet Ben Zhao is on the cusp of something big. 2014 Capstone Senior Design Competition This year eight teams of computer science and computer engineering undergraduates participated in the Capstone Senior Design course which pairs motivated students with industry leaders to tackle challenging problems in computer science with real world relevance.
