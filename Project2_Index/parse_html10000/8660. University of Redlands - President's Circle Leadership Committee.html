We do this because we believe that the personal touch still matters to our alumni, parents and friends, as it does to our students. The committee is made up of alumni and parent volunteers, who are also President’s Circle level donors.  Circle members provide more than 80% of the private support Redlands depends on each year.  The combined impact of these gifts is profound, helping us sustain and enhance the Redlands experience.  Since its inception, the volunteers of the President’s Circle Leadership Committee have raised almost $1.2 million to support Redlands.  These volunteers help to ensure that every deserving student has access to a life-enriching Redlands education. Volunteer Duties To be a volunteer, you must truly believe in the importance of the Redlands mission and be willing to demonstrate that support through your own personal philanthropy at a leadership level of $1,000 or more annually. You also need to be excited about encouraging others to join you as a member of the President’s Circle and be able to participate in at least one campaign lasting about four to six weeks, beginning with a kickoff meeting. You also would need to commit to contacting 10 to 15 people during the annual campaign to thank them  for their support, ask for their renewed gift, and when appropriate, request that they upgrade their support. As a volunteer, you also would work with the Development team as needed to identify and recruit new members of the President’s Circle Leadership Committee and identify and recruit potential new leadership donors. For more information about volunteering, please contact Patience Boudreaux, Director of Annual Giving, at 909-748-8354 or Pactience_Boudreax@redlands.edu.
