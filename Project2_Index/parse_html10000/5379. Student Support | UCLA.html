The UCLA Career Center provides comprehensive services and resources to aid students, alumni and employers. From the first day of freshman year through every level of graduate study, the center helps students unify their academic and career goals. Using your desired career outcomes as a guide, we help you customize your course selection and find mentorship and internship opportunities. And even as alumni, our career center will help you transition from one career to another. Because once you're a Bruin, you're always a Bruin. Our incoming student community exceeds 13,000 undergraduates and graduates every year, and we offer an array of support services to ease the transition to UCLA. For international students, the Dashew Center provides a wide variety of services, including assistance with immigration regulations, neighborhood orientation and programs in English conversation. For freshman, graduate and transfer students, our New Student and Transition Programs offer orientation services and can match you with a new student adviser.
