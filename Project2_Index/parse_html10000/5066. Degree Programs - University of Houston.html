Students are also required to complete 600 hours of industry-related work experience as part of Hospitality Practicum I and II and choose an area of emphasis to create a personalized degree plan that focuses on the sector of hospitality that interests them most. Students pursuing a career in the wine & spirits industry may also choose to earn a minor in beverage management and marketing. MS in Hospitality Management: This program is designed to give graduates a competitive edge and increased earning potential in the global hospitality marketplace. It includes core courses in business, management and research, combined with support courses in hospitality marketing, food & beverage management, revenue management and a variety of electives. To earn this degree, students must complete a minimum of 36 semester credit ours and either a thesis or professional paper. Students with the equivalent of a U.S. four-year bachelor’s degree in any discipline are eligible to apply. Joint MS/MBA: This three-year degree is offered through a partnership between Hilton College and the University of Houston’s C.T. Bauer College of Business.
