CENTERWORKERS' COMPENSATION Tips on Searching Enter as much or as little information as you have. The results will show you name, location, phone number and email address. Tip: Searching using fewer fields will give you more results. Tip: Parital strings may provide additional information. (e.g. "soc" returns "social work," "social science" and "sociology") Tip: If the 5-digit extension begins with a "5", it can be dialed from off-campus by preceding it with the 562 area code if necessary, then "98" (i.e., ext. 54111 becomes 562-985-4111). Telecom Request Instructions for Requests Choose Sections for Printing Instructions for Directory Update Speech Recognition / 24-Hour Attendant A speech recognition system is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, to help you self-connect to the department, program, or person you're trying to reach. State the name as clearly as possible, and your call will be routed immediately! From On-Campus, call: 5-4111 From Off-Campus, call: (562) 985-4111 If you call during normal business hours, and find that the system has any difficulty connecting your call, it will redirect you to the campus operator for assistance. If this occurs, please let the operator know that the speech recognition system was not able to complete your call, so that the operator can report trouble. Speech recognition is administered and supported by Telecommunications at no expense to other departments.
