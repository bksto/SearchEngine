Actual figures (inner ring) reflect the most current data available for each metric. The data rings are color-­coded as follows: 2013-14 Actuals and 2008-09 Actuals. # Metric 2008-2009 Actuals 2013-2014 Actuals 2020 Goals 1 Undergraduate Enrollment 29,719 32,987 39,630 2 Research Expenditures $565.292 M $587.030 M $1.2 B 3 Annual Bachelor's Degrees 5,914 6,370 8,100 4 Freshman Retention 79.3% 81.9% 89% 5 Six Year Graduation 57.2% 60.3% 65% 6 Community College Transfers 1,621 1,759 3,000 7 Community College to Bachelor's 991 1,180 2,000 8 Online Degrees 220 300 1,000   Never Settle News These stories, from across campus, highlight the UA's broad and varied efforts to realize Never Settle goals.   Never Settle in the News Local and national media coverage of the UA's work in Never Settle's four key areas: innovating, engaging, partnering and synergy.   Never Settle in Action Some recent accomplishments of the UA’s Never Settle Strategic Academic and Business Plan, in no particular order. 1.Online degrees, graduation rates trending upward Between 2009 and 2014, the UA increased its online degree programs from 220 to 300, increased its six-year graduation rate from 57.2 percent to 60.3 percent and saw an increase in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded from 5,914 to 6,370. 2.Internship growth presents new opportunities for students In 2014 the UA introduced 400 new internships with major companies such as Apple and General Mills, representing a 13 percent growth in internships offered. Internships are a critical component of the University's 100% Engagement initiative to ensure students graduate real-world ready. 3.Leading the way in STEM education, degrees The UA is leading a national movement to reform STEM education by making science, technology, engineering and math courses more engaging. The University is above average nationally in the number of STEM students it graduates. Nearly 18 percent of UA degrees awarded are in STEM fields, compared to the national average of 15.6 percent. 4.New research awards support boundless innovation The UA saw an increase in new research awards between 2013 and 2014, from 834 to 931. Total funding from those awards is up 53 percent, from $203 million to $310 million. 5.Building an Extension program in Mexico As the state's land-grant institution, the UA has led outreach efforts through its Cooperative Extension offices across Arizona. Now the University is assisting efforts to build a similar network in Mexico. The UA has launched a new project called the Red de Extensión e Innovación Nacional Universitaria, also known as project REINU. The name translates to the National University Extension and Innovation Network. Project REINU will serve Mexico as a national university-based network of scientists and educators to provide resources and educational services across the country. 6.Institute for Career Readiness and Engagement connects students with real-world experiences The UA has launched the Institute for Career Readiness and Engagement to help students build their resumés and prepare them to graduate workforce-ready. With support from the Office of the Governor's Workforce Development Grant program, the institute will connect students with experiences and employers like never before, through expanded early career coaching programs, an enhanced Internship Readiness Program and more. 7.New UA degree to address critical need for Arizona The Arizona Board of Regents has approved the UA's Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Program, set to launch in fall 2015. The program will help address the critical veterinarian shortage in rural Arizona communities and tribal nations and will benefit bioscience businesses and promote public health. 8.Transformative gift supports scientific and cultural studies A transformative gift of more than $50 million from the estate of philanthropist Agnese Nelms Haury will allow the UA to establish a unique interdisciplinary program focused on environment, society and the Southwest. One of the largest gifts in University history, it pushed the $1.5 billion Arizona NOW fundraising campaign past the billion-dollar threshold. 9.Supporting campus researchers The UA's Office of Research and Discovery, formerly the Office of the Senior Vice President for Research, has been restructured to provide improved research administration services for campus researchers. A new Research Development Services unit within the office will offer centralized support for researchers, including direct communication about funding opportunities and consultation and workshops on how to find and successfully compete for external funding. 10.New opportunities for cross-border collaboration The recently opened Arizona State Trade and Investment Office in Mexico City will help enhance partnerships between the UA and the business and science and technology communities in Mexico. The UA has maintained its own Mexico City office since 2007, focused on research and partnerships between the University and Mexico. 11.Early Recruitment unit established to support enrollment goals An Early Recruitment unit has been established within the Office of Early Academic Outreach to help prepare students and their families to join the UA community. Early Recruitment provides middle school students, parents and educators with programming to ensure that students are aware, eligible and prepared for a college education. The unit aims to have a presence in every middle/junior high in Pima County and to eventually expand statewide. 12.Transfer students on the rise The number of Arizona community college students who transfer to the UA increased by 9 percent between 2011 and 2014, with an increase of 2.7 percent between fall 2013 and fall 2014. Meanwhile, the UA continues to establish more bridge-to-transfer agreements with community colleges across the state. As of October 2014, the University had such agreements with 17 colleges – six of those added in the prior 12 months – with four others in discussions. 13.Workshop series touts multidisciplinarity The University has launched a workshop series, titled "Let's Talk Multidisciplinary," that focuses on the value of, and strategies for, collaborative multidisciplinary efforts. National agencies are increasingly looking to such collaborations to address big issues. This workshop series is designed to bring together faculty members and researchers on campus to talk about the multidisciplinarity and how it can enable the campus innovate, grow and meet the challenges of Never Settle. 14.UA responsibility-centered management initiative moves forward Significant progress has been made on the UA's Responsibility Centered Management budget initiative. The RCM preliminary model has been completed with data from FY11, FY12, FY13 and FY14, been reviewed by the RCM Steering Committee and the Responsibility Unit Business Officers group, and is being developed into the preliminary RCM forecasting model. This forecasting model is expected to be completed sometime in October. Meetings to update campus stakeholders on the progress of the RCM process are taking place with a variety of audiences, and a robust schedule of meetings and open forums is planned for fall and spring semesters. 15.UA to invest in world-class online writing program The UA's Division of Student Affairs and Enrollment Management and Office of Academic Initiatives and Student Success is partnering with the Department of English in the College of Social and Behavioral Science to develop the best online writing program in the country. This year, the Department of English will begin development of a pilot writing program and also hire an expert in online writing. This initiative, which parallels the UA's commitment to building fully-online programming that meets the high quality standards of the institution, will help propel the UA into the top tier of campuses developing cutting edge digital educational resources. 16.UA transcripts will show students’ work readiness The UA’s 100% Student Engagement initiative, a key part of the Never Settle plan, ensures internships, research efforts, studies abroad and other work-ready opportunities are available to all UA students to gain real-world, practical experience—and beginning this fall, such experience will be notated on transcripts. 17.Tech Launch Arizona elevates UA research commercialization Tech Launch Arizona has worked with the faculty senate to revise tenure rules to incentivize faculty commercialization and entrepreneurial activities. In the last fiscal year, Tech Launch Arizona negotiated 72 licenses, filed 167 patent applications, secured 24 patents and helped jump start 11 new companies. 18.UA’s Guaranteed Tuition program provides peace of mind A primary goal of Never Settle is keeping the UA affordable for qualified students. UA's recently launched Guaranteed Tuition program will provide students—and their families—with a predictable budget for college and a strong incentive to graduate in four years. 19.Support for UA Native American grad students gets boost with $2.4 million grant This grant from the Sloan Indigenous Graduate Partnership will renew for three years, enabling the UA to realize the Never Settle goal to bolster efforts to recruit, retain and graduate Native Americans, specifically in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the STEM disciplines. 20.UAHN and Banner agreement could represent a significant investment into Tucson and the University for healthcare and related education and research activities The proposed transaction includes $500 million in capital commitment within five years of closing for new construction, renovation and expansion in support of the clinical enterprise; an additional $20 million in annual academic support for the clinical enterprise for at least the next 15 years, and the establishment of a $300 million endowment that would provide a guaranteed $20 million a year over the next 30 years in support of the academic endeavors and activities of the University's Colleges of Medicine. 21.New Research Gateway will help UA increase research expenditures This online resource will serve as a one-stop shop for researchers seeking information on funding opportunities; how to put together proposals; understanding the responsible conduct of research; and more—contributing to the Never Settle goal of doubling UA research expenditures by 2023, from $600 million to over $1 billion. Researchers currently at the UA, and those yet to be hired in the coming years, will benefit from user-friendly access to the support they need in seeking external grants and contracts. 22.Digital humanities initiatives expand at the UA In the spirit of Never Settle’s pillar—innovating—an increasing number of UA employees are engaged in the digital humanities movement, one that encourages the expansion and use of technologies like geo-tagging, informatics and augmented realities to enhance student learning and cross-discipline engagement. Advocates include: UA English professor Ken McAllister, an expert in Internet memes; Africana Studies professor Bryan Carter, who is teaching students how to harness the power of the digital world; and Malcolm Compitello, professor and head of the UA Department of Spanish and Portuguese, who has led digital humanities task force for the College of Humanities. 23.Making sense of how we do things In its inaugural year, the Campaign for Common Sense, a quality improvement program that solicits employee recommendations, has generated more than 800 unique ideas to diversify revenue, increase efficiency, grow our research enterprise, enhance the student experience, and improve the quality of work life. Implemented improvements include an expedited approach for managing clinical trials, a more flexible course withdrawal policy, a streamlined faculty hiring process, more transparent communication about academic program fees, and a cost-saving enterprise learning management system for employees. 24.UA student retention efforts are helping students graduate First Time, Full Time Freshman (FTFTF) Retention rates are at their highest levels ever for the University of Arizona. Retention rates have increased significantly since 2010. In 2010, first-to-second-year retention was 77.4%. For 2013, the overall student retention increased to 81.5% and retention of ethnic minority students increased to 80.9% (9% better than 2010). 25.UA Genetics Core accredited for precision health testing The UA Genetics Core, a member of the UA BIO5 Institute, was recently accredited to provide genetic testing—placing the UA in a position to offer a number of genetic testing options to the medical community at large, advancing the emerging field of precision health that allows physicians to customize treatments for patients. Building strength in this area is a Never Settle strategic priority.
