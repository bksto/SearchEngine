For courses having both lecture and recitation, the examination will be determined from the start time of the first lecture period. Certain courses will be examined at special periods as noted. For courses not included in either the regular exam schedule or the special exam periods, the examination date and time will be determined by the mutual agreement of the instructor and the students in the course. If any student is assigned four examinations during the same day, the University Final Examination Committee will seek reassignment if so requested by the student at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the Final Examination Period. All exams will be held in the regularly assigned room unless otherwise indicated by the instructor.
