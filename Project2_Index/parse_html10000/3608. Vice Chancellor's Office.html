With state funds accounting for a steadily declining portion of the total campus budget, supporting UC Santa Barbara's efforts to raise funds from private sources is a goal shared across the division and, indeed, the campus. Strengthening the campus's relationships with alumni, parents, donors, and the public is critical to UCSB's success in achieving that goal.
