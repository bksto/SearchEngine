Be sure to have all the information you need close at hand. Review your responses and check for accuracy. Still, we know mistakes can happen. If after applying you discover an error, you can make changes to your application. What you'll need It's a good idea to have everything prepared before you start your application so you're not trying to track down information at the last minute. Here's what you'll need: Transcripts. Don't submit your transcripts to UC at this point, but refer to them as you fill out the application to ensure the information you enter is accurate.* Test scores. If you're a freshman or sophomore applicant, you'll have to include your scores from the ACT Plus Writing or the SAT Reasoning Test. (If you're applying for fall, be sure to complete these tests by December). All applicants should report scores for any SAT Subject Tests, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, TOEFL or IELTS exams they have taken.  Annual income for last year and the current year (your parents' if you're a dependent; your income if you're independent). This is optional unless you're applying for an application fee waiver or for the Educational Opportunity Program. Social Security number, if you have one. We use this to match your application to things like your test score report, final transcript(s) and, if you're applying for financial aid, your Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Citizenship status. You must enter your country of citizenship (or "No Selection"). If your country of citizenship is outside the United States, you'll need to provide your immigration status and your visa type. California Statewide Student ID (optional). Each K-12 student in California public schools is assigned an ID number. If it's not printed on your transcript, ask your counselor or registrar. Credit card. If you prefer to pay by check, you can mail your payment. * Veterans or active-duty military personnel: If you completed courses offered by a branch of the U.S. military, you may indicate your intention to submit your military transcript by checking the box in the "About You" section of the application. If you are admitted and accept an offer of admission, you can then submit official military transcripts (e.g., ACE, SMAART) to the UC campus. Technical issues Browser recommendations The UC online application functions with versions of Firefox, Internet Explorer 8 or higher, Chrome 6 or higher and Safari 5 or higher. You can download one of these browsers from the list below. Mozilla Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome Safari JavaScript Our application uses JavaScript web page functionality. Please make sure JavaScript is enabled on your browser.

Get help If students have a question about the application process, call the application center at (800) 207-1710 (within the U.S.) or (661) 336-5723 (outside the U.S.) during normal business hours, or e-mail ucinfo@applyucsupport.net. My UC Application The application is now closed to applicants for fall 2015. See what you should do after you apply. Transcripts & letters of recommendation Don't send official transcripts when you apply. If you're admitted to UC, then you must submit final transcripts to your campus admissions office. UC does not require (nor read) letters of recommendation at the time of application. A campus may ask for them later as part of a supplemental review, so be sure to check your email.
