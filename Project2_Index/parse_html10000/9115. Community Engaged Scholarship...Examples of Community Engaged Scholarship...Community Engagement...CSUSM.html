By advancing innovative, student-centered practices that inspire reflective teaching and learning, the middle level team and middle school teachers engage in a variety of collaborative experiences and activities. Clinical Practice workshops are held twice yearly which provide opportunities to share best practices with teacher candidates. Through the workshops, teachers from San Marcos, Oceanside, Vista, Escondido, Poway, San Dieguito, and Valley Center districts meet with members of the university teaching team and identify ways to support adult learners (the teacher candidates) to make connections between middle level educational theory and practice.  Topics of partnership include motivation, conceptual mathematics, science fairs, and literacy instruction.
