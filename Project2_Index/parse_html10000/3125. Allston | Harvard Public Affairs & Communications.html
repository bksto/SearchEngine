Harvard operates a number of facilities in the neighborhood, including Harvard Business School, and the University’s athletic facilities, the Harvard Allston Education Portal, the Harvard Innovation Lab, and the Harvard Ceramics Program. On July 26, 2013, the University filed an Institutional Master Plan (IMP) with the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA). The 280-page document outlines a 10-year plan for Harvard’s campus in Allston and provides a long-term vision to guide future campus and community development. The plan also includes a number of appendices and technical reports. In addition to advancing Harvard’s educational mission, the IMP – which details nine institutional projects totaling 1.4 million square feet – seeks to activate Barry’s Corner, create a new network of green spaces, enhance the public realm, promote environmental sustainability, strengthen pedestrian connections, improve transportation, and provide a community benefits program that is in line with the scope and scale of the plan.    Media Resources Featured Story Popular Topics Admissions & Financial Aid Allston Commencement Endowment Leadership University Statistics Harvard in the World Harvard in the Community HarvardX/edX Quick Facts Content Use Guidelines hpac-footer-banner.png      1350 Massachusetts Avenue      Smith Campus Center      Cambridge, MA 02138      T (617) 495-1585 | F (617) 495-0754  Find Harvard on:  Facebook  LinkedIn  Twitter  Google Plus  YouTube  iTunes U  RSS  All Mobile Admin Login OpenScholar Copyright © 2015 The President and Fellows of Harvard College | Accessibility | Terms of Use | Report Copyright Infringement
