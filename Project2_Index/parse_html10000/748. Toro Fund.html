Skip to main content MyCSUDH Faculty/Staff Alumni Parents Administration Directory ADMISSIONS ACADEMICS CAMPUS LIFE STUDENT SERVICES ABOUT Search The Toro Fund The Toro Fund is the primary means of donations made by alumni, parents, friends and students at CSU Dominguez Hills. The unrestricted fund allows the university to support the areas of greatest need on campus, such as; student scholarships, campus improvements, faculty research and many other initiatives not backed by student fees or state funding. Gifts are made on an annual basis allowing the university to maintain the exceptional educational experience and give students the best opportunity to reach their highest potential. Every gift, no matter the size, makes a difference in the lives of our students. Many private foundations and corporations look at how many people give rather than the amount of their gifts when determining whether to make large contributions to CSU Dominguez Hills. Your donation of any amount may help spur larger gifts to the university. Whether you want to give back to the university that gave you so much, leave a legacy for future Toros or simply would like a tax deduction, we appreciate your generosity regardless of your motivation. Donate now, or for more information contact Andre Khachaturians, Senior Director of Annual Giving and Advancement Services by email or at (310) 243-3276.
