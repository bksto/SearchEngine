It includes average amounts for standard expenses- including tuition, fees, books, supplies, room, board, and other living expenses- for three quarters of study. Keep in mind that your actual costs may differ. Eligible expenses must occur between mid-September through mid-June. Our office reserves the right to exercise professional judgement to deny requests that are not considered direct educational expenses. 2014-2015 Undergraduate Cost of Attendance Student Expense Budgets Living On-Campus Living Off-Campus Living at Home With Parents (Commuter) Nonresident Living On-Campus (2) CA Resident Tuition and Fees (1) $13,896 $13,896 $13,896 $36,774 Books & Supplies 1,560 1,560 1,560 1,560 Room & Board (3) 14,218 8,201 4,643 14,218 Personal Expenses 1,522 1,928 2,011 1,522 Transportation 620 1,358 1,640 620 Subtotal (without Health Insurance) $31,816 $26,943 $23,750 $54,694 Health Insurance (4) $1,869 $1,869 $1,869 $1,869 Total Costs (with Health Insurance) $33,685 $28,812 $25,619 $56,563 (1) Financial Aid Cost of Attendance includes estimated tuition and fees. These figures may not be final. Actual tuition, fees, and charges are subject to change by the Regents of the University of California and could be affected by State funding reductions. Accordingly, final approved levels (and thus a student’s final balance due) may differ from the amounts shown. For the most recent tuition and fee amounts, please visit the Office of Budget & Institutional Analysis website. Figures exclude the one-time $150 entering undergraduate document fee. If applicable, this budget component will be included on MyAwards under Other Costs. (2) Undergraduate nonresident tuition and fees of $36,774 (not including health insurance) includes nonresident supplemental tuition of $22,878 in addition to systemwide tuition and fees plus campus-based fees totaling $13,896. Example nonresident budget is based on the On-Campus figures. Actual budget may vary. (3) Students residing in campus apartments or other housing not designated as a Residence Hall or who transfer to single student apartments do not have a recognized Housing Contract, they have a 12-month lease; therefore, those students are not eligible for an "On-Campus" budget. Residing in housing located on campus or opting to purchase a meal plan (which is available to all students) does not meet the criteria for an "On-Campus" budget. (4) The Health Insurance budget component is subject to change, as the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) fee has not yet been set for 2014-2015. As such, the Cost of Attendance reflected in MyAwards will be adjusted once this figure becomes available. This mandatory fee can be waived, as long as the student can show proof that he or she has adequate private health insurance. For more information on the SHIP waiver, please visit the Student Health and Counseling Services website. It is important to note that financial aid will not cover the health insurance budget component for dependent students who elect to waive out. Students who wish to declare additional expenses related to rent may contact the Financial Aid Office to ask about Documenting Additional Expenses. 2013-2014 Undergraduate Cost of Attendance Student Expense Budgets Living On-Campus Living Off-Campus Living at Home With Parents (Commuter) Nonresident Living On-Campus (2) CA Resident Tuition and Fees (1) $13,902 $13,902 $13,902 $36,780 Books & Supplies 1,620 1,620 1,620 1,620 Room & Board (3) 13,961 8,336 4,470 13,961 Personal Expenses 1,251 1,416 1,703 1,251 Transportation 575 1,396 1,814 575 Subtotal (without Health Insurance) $31,309 $26,670 $23,509 $54,187 Health Insurance (4) $1,764 $1,764 $1,764 $1,764 Total Costs (with Health Insurance) $33,073 $28,434 $25,273 $55,951 (1) Financial Aid Student Expense Budgets include estimated tuition and fees.
