Where is the ATC? The ATC is located on the Lower Level of W.E.B. Du Bois Library. Who can use the ATC? The ATC is open to any member of the University community who has an ADA-defined disability and requires assistive technology support. What do I need to use the ATC? Members of the University community who wish to use the ATC must register with Disability Services and also hold an active IT Account. For more information, see Disability Services and IT Accounts. When can I use the ATC? The ATC is open during Du Bois Library hours of operation.

Contact the Assistive Technologies Center Specialist, Rob Eveleigh, at atc@oit.umass.edu or 413-545-1613. What if I want to bring my personal assistant with me? The ATC welcomes all clients and their personal assistants. However, assistants may not use the ATC for personal work. In cases where assistants do use the ATC for personal work, their assistant privileges may be revoked and they may not be allowed to work with their clients in the ATC. Do I need to provide anything of my own? Yes, to save your files you must bring your own storage media such as a USB drive, or save your files to networked file storage (e.g., UDrive). You will also need earphones if you use applications that generate audio output. Inexpensive earphones may be purchased at the University Store in the Campus Center.
