Visit Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS.) It is easy for work to get piled up during the weeks before midterms, so if you need a place to take a breath and relax, go to CAPS! CAPS has many resources like nap areas, massage chairs, face-to-face appointments with a CAPS advisor, and much more.  Located on the 3rd floor of the union, CAPS is a great way to manage stress throughout exams! Don’t forget to sleep.  As easy as it sounds, sleep is an essential part of the formula for success on exams and often gets forgotten.  Not even all of the all-nighters and cups of coffee in the world will help you on exams, without sleep.   Along with goals, set mini goals.  Often times, classes have seemingly endless study guides that you can read for hours on end and retain little information.  If you have a 20 page study guide, try reading 3 or 4 pages at a time then taking a break.  This will allow you to have something to look forward to while studying as well as retaining as much information as possible! If it suits you, try to not study at home.  Even just the thought of studying can impact your mood negatively, so try to keep home a safe haven.  Umich has countless libraries and study spots to check out with friends, when you’re at home let it be time to hang out and relax. Finally, stay calm.  One of the most important parts of exams is to remind yourself that you are at this school for a reason.  It is easy to get caught up in the stress and negativity of studying, but you wouldn’t be at this school if you couldn’t handle it! Remember, if you take your time, schedule accordingly, and keep focused, you have little to worry about! Good luck to all and Go Blue!
