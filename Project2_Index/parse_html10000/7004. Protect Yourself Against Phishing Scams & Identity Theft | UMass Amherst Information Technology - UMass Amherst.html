If you have an account with this institution, contact them directly and ask them to verify the information included in the email. Do not click any links provided in these emails (or cut and paste them into a browser). This may download viruses to your computer, or at best, confirm your email address to phishers. Do not open any attachments. If you receive an attachment you are not expecting, confirm with the senders that they did indeed send the message and meant to send an attachment. Do not enter your personal information on an untrusted Web site or form referenced in this email.  Delete the message. If you responded to a suspicious email Contact your financial institution. Report the content of your email and your actions to the security or fraud department. File a police report. Contact the UMass Police Department at (413) 545-2121 or your local police department. If you have already provided your IT Account information in response to a phishing email, your account may be disabled (all accounts that display signs of suspicious activity will be frozen). It is critical that you: Contact the IT Help Center to report the incident and get your IT Account re-instated (if applicable). Change your IT Account password immediately in SPIRE. If your IT Account has been disabled, you will create a new password when you re-activate your account. Never email your personal or financial information Email is not a secure method of communicating sensitive information. Remember that legitimate financial institutions never ask for sensitive information via email. Review your credit card and bank account statements The best way to monitor activity on your financial accounts is to carefully inspect your credit report every year. Federal law requires the nation’s major credit reporting companies to give everyone a free credit report every 12 months. Once you have your report, look for inaccurate information or unfamiliar accounts. Check your bank and credit card statements as soon as you get them. A great deal of damage can happen in 30 days. Consider switching to online statements. Use email etiquette To ensure that your email isn't mistaken for an infected message: Always include a clear, descriptive subject for your email. Consider using a signature, your name and contact information, on your email. Always include a mention of the attachment and a description of why you are sending it in the body of your email.
