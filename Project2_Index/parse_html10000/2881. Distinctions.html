The faculty has made a commitment to excellence in both teaching and research, and most University classes are taught in small sections so students have an opportunity for regular contact with their professors as well as involvement in original research and creative activities under faculty supervision. As a result, CSULB has attracted 350 California Merit Finalists among its current undergraduate population. CSULB also offers a wealth of cultural and recreational opportunities. There are live performances of plays, music, and dance in the University's seven theater facilities virtually every night of the week. The University Art Museum and the student and faculty galleries in the Art and Design departments afford access to exciting innovations in the visual arts. Nineteen men's and women's sports compete in our excellent and competitive NCAA Division I athletic program. The women's volleyball team has appeared in 8 Final Fours in the last 15 years, winning 3 national championships and finishing second in 2001. The athletic program also includes club or intramural competition in approximately 30 different sports. The Associated Students, Inc. and the Office of Student Life and Development sponsor nearly 200 additional campus organizations, ranging from fraternities and sororities to cultural associations, religious clubs, honor societies, political and social action clubs, and special interest clubs.
