Eighty permanent buildings house the various colleges, 63 academic departments and programs, 24 centers, four institutes and four clinics. The student-operated University Student Union is located at the crossroads of the campus, providing a focal point for the total campus community. Brotman Hall, near the Union, houses many centralized campus services and administrative offices. There are also specialized facilities for Engineering Technology, Art, Industrial and Interior Design, Music, Molecular and Life Sciences, and Nursing as well as the International House student residence hall and meeting complex. A state‑of‑the‑art building for the College of Business Administration, complete with decision‑support laboratories, multi‑media capability, and modern lecture halls, opened in 1991. The Department of Dance occupies quarters in the largest and best‑equipped instructional dance facility in the nation. The striking beauty of the campus owes much to the planting of 3,200 Helen Borcher flowering peach trees that were donated by the citizens of Long Beach. Secluded landscape areas and buildings of appropriate scale help maintain a learning environment that encourages small group identification and personal privacy in the midst of 37,000 individuals sharing the same site, on what is essentially a large urban campus. In 1965, the International Sculpture Symposium contributed 9 monumental pieces and designs to the University. These works received credits in 21 national and international publications, and in 1972 additional community funds in the form of a trust provided for the completion of the Carlson Memorial Tower, designed by French sculptor Andre Bloc. The campus sculpture collection has continued to expand, with the addition of works by artists such as Guy Dill, Michael Davis, Robert Irwin, Bryan Hunt, and Woods Davy. These acquisitions were made possible by private donations and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts to the University Art Museum.
