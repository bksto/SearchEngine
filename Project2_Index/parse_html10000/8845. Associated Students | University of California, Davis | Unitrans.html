In 1972, Unitrans was opened to the general public with partial funding from the City of Davis. The ASUCD/City of Davis partnership continues today and now Unitrans provides public transportation service to the entire city with 49 buses on 14 routes, carrying over 3 million passengers/year (about 20,000 on a typical day). Every day, numerous Davis residents board Unitrans buses to reach various destinations throughout the city and on campus. Although many passengers are students going to and from campus,  Unitrans  is also used extensively for excursions to junior and senior high schools, downtown,  neighborhood shopping centers, medical offices, senior centers, theaters, and the Farmers’ Market. Buses serve these locations every weekday from 7am-11pm, and weekends from 9am-6pm. Buses run more frequently during the UCD academic year when ridership is higher, and less frequently during the summer and breaks. You can pick up a printed schedule at most public buildings or visit our website for more details.  The printed schedule and website include a calendar showing the type of service running each day of the year, but you can also call 752-2877 (BUSS) to check. Unitrans is free for UC Davis undergraduates with a valid UCD ID card. Anyone can ride Unitrans for one dollar cash fare, and many types of prepaid discounted tickets and passes are available. Seniors (60+) may also ride free with an ID card available from the Senior Center. More information on fares and passes is available on the “Fares” page or call 752-2877. Buses: Unitrans is well-known for our fleet of historic London doubledecker buses and two modern doubledecker buses. The doubledecker buses run on six lines (B, E, F, G, J, V) in regular service during the academic year. Their times are noted on the printed schedule and a special flyer. One of the doubledeckers has been converted from a diesel engine to run on clean natural gas. Unitrans’ CNG doubledecker is unique in North America, and perhaps in the world. Although the doubledecker bus is the iconic symbol of Unitrans, most of our service is provided by modern buses fueled by CNG. Drivers: All Unitrans drivers, supervisors and most support staff are UC Davis students. Our drivers undergo extensive training and testing prior to beginning driving with passengers.  Unitrans’ safety record ranks among the best public transit systems in the U.S. Our employees pride themselves on providing safe and friendly service. Other Services: Unitrans connects with several other transit systems, links to which are provided on the “Special Service” page. YoloBus provides service to Sacramento, Woodland, the Sacramento Airport, as well as in Davis and throughout Yolo County. YoloBus connects with Unitrans at the Memorial Union and many common stop locations throughout Davis. Davis Community Transit provides demand responsive service within Davis, including ADA complementary paratransit service. Unitrans also connects with Amtrak/Capitol Corridor trains in downtown Davis, and a special shuttle operates on Sunday evenings when regular Unitrans service does not run. Other inter-city services available on the UCD campus include Fairfield and Suisun Transit, the UCD Med Center Shuttle, and the UC Berkeley Shuttle.
