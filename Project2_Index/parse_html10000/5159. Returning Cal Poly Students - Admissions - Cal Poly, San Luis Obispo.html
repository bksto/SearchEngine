A returning student is one who has no enrollment record for 3 consecutive regular terms (fall, winter, spring). If you have missed 2 terms, you may enroll without completing a returning student application. Once you have missed 3 terms, you must complete a returning student application. The easiest way to submit the paper application is to come to the Cal Poly Admissions Office (Administration Bldg., Rm. 206, M-F, 8am-5pm) with your personal check in the amount of $55, payable to 'Cal Poly', for the application fee. If you are not in the local area, you may download and print an application form below: If you are an undergraduate and applying to the Fall 2015, Winter 2016 or Spring 2016, use this application: http://admissions.calpoly.edu/pdf/2015-2016_Application_Form_Undergrad.pdf If you are a graduate and applying to the Fall 2015, Winter 2016 or Spring 2016, use this application: http://admissions.calpoly.edu/pdf/2015-2016_Application_Form_Graduate.pdf You will need to complete the application, write 'Former/Returning Student' at the top of the application and mail it, along with your check for $55 to: Cal Poly Admissions, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 before the stated deadline above. Former students who did not leave the university in good standing (i.e. academically dismissed/disqualified), will have their application and transcripts sent to their department/college for review before reinstatement can occur. Applicants in this category are advised to contact their department or advising center and begin dialogue about satisfying any requirements before submitting the application, per the instructions outlined above. Former Students Returning to Cal Poly in a New Major Former Cal Poly students who have not completed an undergraduate degree, who wish to return to Cal Poly in a new major will be given the same consideration for admission as new transfer applicants. The application filing period for the fall term is October 1st to November 30th of the previous year. Cal Poly does not consider undergraduate applications for terms other than fall.
