They are often attached to e-mail messages, but can be exchanged in other ways, such as on the World Wide Web. They can contain name and address information, phone numbers, URLs, logos, photographs, and even audio clips. The vCard link helps users to minimize their efforts when adding a new contact to their contacts list within their own e-mail handler. To download a vCard click on the Add listing to your address book to the right of the vCard image. If your browser is configured to open vCard files with your address book application the vCard will be loaded, if not, you can save the file to your desktop and open it with your address book program if it supports vCard.   Make a gift to UC Davis Vision of Excellence Principles of Community UC Davis Extension University of California University of California, Davis One Shields Avenue Davis, CA 95616 | (530) 752-1011 Questions or comments? | Last update: September 24, 2011 Copyright © The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus.
