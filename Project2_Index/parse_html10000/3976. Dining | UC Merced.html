With access to the San Joaquin Valley region’s bountiful produce, dining services provides high-quality, great tasting cuisine that suits a host of culinary tastes, appetites and dietary needs. On a daily basis, diners have a choice of soups, entrees, fresh vegetable selections, a variety of fruits, a salad bar and more. Looking for something on the go? Look no further than an assortment of pre-made deli sandwiches and wraps. Everyone on campus can also participate in a reusable-container program that reduces packaging waste and helps the campus stay green. Ask about an OZZI container when you want to take your meal to go. On-campus residents can enjoy their meals at the Yablokoff-Wallace Dining Center with the rest of the campus community, or find a quiet spot outdoors for a picnic. Dining Services also operates the Lantern Café in the Leo and Dottie Kolligian Library and the Diesel Dogs food cart. Meal plans and OZZI containers are easily managed via CatCard.
