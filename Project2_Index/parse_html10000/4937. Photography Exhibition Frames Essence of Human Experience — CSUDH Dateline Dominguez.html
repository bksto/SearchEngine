WHAT:       “Portraits of the Human Experience” WHEN:      January 28 through March 17, 2015 Opening reception, Wednesday, Jan. 28, 5:30-7:30 p.m. WHERE:     University Art Gallery, LaCorte Hall, A-107 California State University, Dominguez Hills, 1000 E. Victoria St., Carson, Calif. Guest curators Nate Lubben (Class of ’13, B.A., art), an adjunct instructor on campus, and Ellie Zenhari, assistant professor in the Department of Art and Design, have brought together photographers who capture the essence of the human spirit in their dramatic compositions. Featured are internationally known Los Angeles-based photographers Robert Yager and Ted Soqui. Yager is best known for his photographs of underground culture in Los Angeles. His works have been featured in The New York Times Magazine, Fortune, Esquire, and Rolling Stone. Photojournalist Soqui has covered nearly every major story in the Los Angeles over the past four decades. His coverage of the Occupy L.A. movement resulted in the now iconic image representing TIME’s Person of the Year in 2011: the protester. Photo by Robert Yager: “Money collected from crack-cocaine sales being counted next to a sleeping baby.” Photo by Zalmy Berkowitz   Also included is prominent photographer Gregory Bojorquez’s edgy photo collage, “Eastsider” as well as his major series of 11 dynamic large-scale photographs documenting everyday life in East Los Angeles. Rouding out the exhibit are Zalmy Berkowitz and his intimate photos of exuberant family life, and well-known Aubrey Edwards’s luminous portraits of environmentalists from New Orleans. An opening reception for the artists will take place on Wednesday, Jan. 28, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m., in the University Art Gallery. As part of the evening, the guest curators will lead a conversation with the artists beginning at 6 p.m. Student Showcase The University Art Gallery will also be displaying “Student Showcase: The Don Quixote Festival” in conjunction with a university-wide festival on the famous novels by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedre.
