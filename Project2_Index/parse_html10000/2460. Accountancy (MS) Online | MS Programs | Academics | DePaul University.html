Courses use video lectures, online exams and quizzes and rich discussion to communicate the material. Instructors are available regularly for direct feedback and to help with course content.  Just like its on on-campus counterpart, the online MS in Accountancy requires 12 courses (48 credits) for students with an undergraduate business degree and 16 courses for students without an undergraduate business degree.  Learn more about this online MSA program.  View course requirements.​​ ​​​​​​​​ Click here for Kellstadt Graduate School of Business admission requirements.
