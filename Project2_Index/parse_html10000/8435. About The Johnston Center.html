Innovation & Research University of Redlands > Innovation & Research > Innovative Teaching > About The Johnston Center About The Johnston Center The Johnston Center is a living and learning community where students are given the freedom to work with professors to develop learning contracts and create their own majors. Johnston graduates have completed a variety of majors, including biopolitics, educational ethics, and rock music as a cultural force for change. The innovative program, which is more than 40 years old, is known for attracting bright, creative, fiercely independent thinkers eager to explore and grapple with some of life’s biggest questions and concepts. The exploration of these big-picture questions is not limited to class time. Johnston Center students can be found thinking, learning and engaging around the clock in the Johnston Center Complex, which includes two residence halls, faculty offices and a coffee house.
