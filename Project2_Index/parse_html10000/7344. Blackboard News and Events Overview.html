Blackboard News Jon Kolko Releases New Book on Consumer Design Kolko argues that innovation should be focused on forging meaningful connections with the people using the products and services, rather than focusing on features. This philosophy is driving Blackboard's new product and design strategy that is grounded in improving the educational experience for students and teachers. Blackboard Acquires ParentLink The announcement marks the latest investment by Blackboard to increase its K-12 focus and continued delivery of solutions designed specifically for the industry. This includes the release of new solutions for blended and flipped classrooms, as well as enhanced distance learning tools for teacher professional development. Blackboard Releases Tablet App for Teachers Through Bb Grader®, teachers and faculty can easily track, sort, and grade student assignments across multiple courses directly from their iOS® tablets. They can also offer text, audio and video feedback on submissions, creating more personalized and engaging responses on projects and tasks. Blackboard Introduces Cloud Version of Flagship LMS Institutions do have different needs and many prefer the unique advantages of self-hosting or managed hosting. So the fact that Blackboard is now able to support those modes of delivery alongside SaaS gives schools unprecedented amount of choice as they decide how they want to work on their hosting environments. Blackboard is the only company that can make this offering.
