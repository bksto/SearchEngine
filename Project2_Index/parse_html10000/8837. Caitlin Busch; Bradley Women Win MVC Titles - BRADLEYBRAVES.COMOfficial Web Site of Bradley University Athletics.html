We were a true team today.”   Senior Emily Delvo (Springfield, Ill./Sacred Heart Griffin) earned all-conference honors for the second consecutive year, crossing the line in fourth with a career-best 5K time of 17:12.85 for the third best time in Bradley history. Right on Delvo’s heels was junior Kristen Busch (Waterloo, Ill./Freeburg) in fifth as she also garnered cross country All-MVC honors for the second straight year.  Kristen Busch clocked a career-best time of 17:15.78 for the fourth fastest 5K in program history.   Senior Rosie Hiles (Hampshire, England/Alton College/University of Birmingham) took home honorable mention all-league honors after finishing 11th at 17:34.86 to miss First-Team All-MVC honors by four seconds.  Junior Lauren Houmes (Hoopeston, Ill./Hoopeston) took 13 seconds off her career-best 5K time, crossing the line at 17:51.62 to finish 18th and round out the scoring for the Braves.   Bradley was 32 points better than second-place finisher Illinois State (71 points) and 39 points ahead of defending champ and third-place finisher Southern Illinois (78 points).   The Braves will host the NCAA Midwest Regional Friday, Nov. 14 at Newman Golf Course.  More Headlines Cross Country Teams Earn USTFCCCA Academic Honors Bradley Announces 2015 Hall of Fame Class Another Record Semester in the Classroom Caitlin Busch Named Country Financial Scholar-Athlete Of The Week Voice Of The Braves Podcast: Nov. 17, 2014 Iowa State Wins Womens NCAA Regional; Braves Third Cross Country Teams Host NCAA Midwest Regional Friday Caitlin Busch Named MVC Scholar-Athlete Of The Week Caitlin Busch Named Country Financial Scholar-Athlete Of The Week Quartet Of Braves Earn MVC Scholar-Athlete Honors Women's Cross Country Third; Men 10th In Midwest Region Poll Voice Of The Braves Podcast: Nov. 3, 2014 Caitlin Busch; Bradley Women Win MVC Titles Cross Country Teams Set For MVC Championships Voice Of The Braves Podcast: Oct. 29, 2014 Launch Player Login Forgot Password x Live Events Live Event Schedule Softball: Bradley vs. Missouri St. Video Stream (03/21/15) Sat,  Mar 21 @  11:45 AM Braves Athletic Teams Men's Sports Baseball Basketball (M) Cross Country (M) Golf (M) Soccer Track & Field (M) Women's Sports Basketball (W) Cross Country (W) Golf (W) Softball Tennis (W) Track & Field (W) Volleyball ALSO ON BRADLEYBRAVES.COM Bradley All-Access Camps Compliance Email Updates Hall of Fame Mission Statement News Feed Photo Galleries Staff Directory Tickets Bradley University 2015 All rights reserved Contact Us Privacy & Terms FAQ Site Map
