With an internationally recognized faculty of twenty-three professors, two permanent lecturers, and more than twenty affiliates and visiting scholars, the Department prides itself on both the breadth and depth of its course offerings and programs. Many of the languages necessary for the study of the religion — Arabic, Hindi, Persian, Punjabi, Sanskrit, and Tibetan — are taught within Religious Studies. The Department will celebrate its 50th anniversary during calendar year 2014. Please check back for details about the many anniversary-related events we are currently planning, and please join us for these celebrations!

Established in 1964 with three full-time professors — Dick Comstock, D. Mackenzie Brown, and Walter Capps — we’ve grown over the past five decades to become the largest Department of Religious Studies in the University of California system, with 26 fulltime faculty, six emeriti, and two permanent lecturers. We also have a large cohort of affiliated faculty whose primary appointments are in disciplines that range across the social sciences and humanities. We are justifiably proud to have played an important role in advancing the academic study of religion in public universities not only in the Golden State, but across the nation.
