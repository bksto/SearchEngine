We're here to help current and prospective undergraduate and graduate students with advising, academic concerns, undergraduate admissions, graduate admissions, academic forms, scholarship applications, study abroad applications, graduation, and student affairs. We invite you to visit or call us with any questions you may have. Advising Mission Statement The College of Architecture’s academic advising team and the Student Services Office are committed to students and their successes. Through the utilization and integration of college and university-wide resources, professional advisors in the College work in partnership with students, faculty, and university representatives across campus to challenge, empower, and support students to make informed and proactive decisions that will advance their academic, personal, and professional goals as graduates of the University of Houston and emerging leaders beyond the university setting. Advising in the College of Architecture is multi-faceted and dynamic. For these reasons, advisors must remain engaged with students and advising issues in order to develop best practices and initiatives that will address issues, challenges, and trends that affect students in higher education and student affairs.
