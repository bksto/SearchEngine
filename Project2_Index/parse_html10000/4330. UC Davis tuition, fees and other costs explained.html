We're going to add up tuition and fees and some estimates for living expenses, books and more. But that may not be the final amount you pay. We'll look at some of the things you might be able to subtract from that total, like financial aid. What's the bottom line? You can do this! Tuition and Fees Update UC regents on Nov. 20 approved a long-term stability plan for tuition and financial aid. The five-year plan provides for low, predictable tuition that will provide funding to increase access for California students, maintain the university's robust financial aid program and invest in educational quality. Under the plan, UC's Tuition and Student Services Fee would not increase more than 5 percent annually for five years beginning in 2015-16. The plan’s increase is on the UC Tuition and Student Services Fee only, which total $12,192 this academic year. For 2015-16, the maximum 5 percent increase would amount to $612. The plan assumes the state will continue to increase its educational support to UC by 4 percent next year, as previously announced. Tuition and fee increases could be lower — or eliminated — if the state provides additional funds above UC's base budget adjustment.
