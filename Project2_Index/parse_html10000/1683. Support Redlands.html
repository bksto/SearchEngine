Your Impact. In the century since our founding, the world around us has changed in profound ways. Yet, one constant has remained—generous alumni, parents and friends have made the conscious choice to enrich the University of Redlands student experience. Private gifts and support have helped us send productive and thoughtful citizens—grounded in the liberal arts and sciences—into our communities. The choice to make a gift to the University of Redlands is personal, affected by many factors. Some choose to support our students directly with gifts to the Redlands Fund, others decide to turn their philanthropic passion into reality by establishing a new endowment or helping with a new building. Still others choose to leave a legacy for future generations of students and faculty through their estate plans. These decisions all have one thing in common—a donor making the conscious choice to invest in the University of Redlands. There are many competing and important causes that deserve support, but the choice to strengthen the University of Redlands is one that directly impacts the student experience at Redlands now and far into the future. We promise—today,tomorrow and forever—to transform your philanthropic choice into a greater and more excellent educational experience for our students. Your gift. Your impact.
