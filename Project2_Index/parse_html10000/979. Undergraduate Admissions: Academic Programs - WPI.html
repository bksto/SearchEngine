Worcester Polytechnic Institute About WPI Academics Admissions Research Campus Life Athletics Skip to Additional Navigation Home  > Admissions > Undergraduate Admissions > Academic Programs Academic Programs As you've probably figured out by now, WPI is different from other schools. Your learning experience here will prepare you to succeed in life after college – whether you want to be a biologist, video game programmer or engineer. Not only will you take rigorous classes that will give you theoretical knowledge, but you'll complete two real-world projects – something no other school does quite the way we do. Through your project work, you'll learn how to put that knowledge to work in the real world – and make a difference before you graduate. WPI in a nutshell: 7-week terms – the fast pace helps you learn to manage your time. No failing grades – feel free to explore new subjects. WPI awards only three grades: A, B and C. No pluses or minuses. If you don't get a C, you will not receive credit for the course and it won't appear on your transcript. 2 real-world projects – you don't have to wait four years to change the world. Collaborative atmosphere – students work with each other on projects and in classes, learning the teamwork skills that are essential in the real world.     Apply to WPI Schedule a Visit Request Information Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Academic Programs Areas of Study Real World Projects Faculty Academic Services Accreditation Graduation Requirements Student Leadership Programs WPI At-a-Glance Living at WPI Your Perspective Applying to WPI Visit with Us Pre-College Opportunities Request Information Admissions Calendar + There are currently no events in the calendar.
