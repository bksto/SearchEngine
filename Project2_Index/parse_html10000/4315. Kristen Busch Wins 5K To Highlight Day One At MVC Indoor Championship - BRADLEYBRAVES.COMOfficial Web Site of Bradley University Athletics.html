Busch became the first Bradley indoor individual conference champion since Mary Ellen Hill won the 3,000 meters at the 2000 Valley indoor championship and posted a school-record 5K time of 16:35.05 to top Hill’s previous school mark of 16:38.82 set in 1998. McMahon was right on her heels in second with a time of 16:42.96 as the duo combined for 18 of Bradley’s 24 points.  The 24 points nearly matched last year’s total of 25 points at the MVC Indoor Championship.  McMahon earned the eighth all-conference honor of her career, while Busch garnered her second all-conference recognition of the academic year. In addition to Busch’s title, sophomore Rachel Sudbury (Tomahawk, Wis./Tomahawk) qualified for Sunday’s championship in the mile and sophomore Emily Delvo (Springfield, Ill./Sacred Heart Griffin) won her heat in the 800 meters to advance to tomorrow’s championship.  "We had a fantastic first day,” said Bradley head coach Marc Burns.  “The 5,000 meters was a breakthrough race for our program.  Kristen (Busch) and Sarah (McMahon) dominated the race from start to finish.  Kristen pulled away after 3,000 meters and Sarah threw down a monster kick to secure second.  (Emily) Delvo ran a smart 800 meter prelim and advanced easily to the final.  She also split 4:53.9 on the anchor of the distance medley relay and brought us from seventh to third.  Rachel (Sudbury) ran a personal best in the mile to advance to the final tomorrow.  We are excited to go after our all-time point total of 38 points set back in the late 1990's." Delvo claimed her heat in the 800 meters with a time of 2:13.23 to clock the third-best 800 meter time of the day and will challenge for Sunday’s title at 3:25 p.m. Sudbury posted a career-best time in the mile at 4:57.64 and clocked the third-best time in the event Saturday to advance to Sunday’s finals.  She is the ninth individual in school history to break five minutes in the mile and her time is seventh among Bradley career marks.  The mile championship will kick off Sunday’s action for the Braves at 1:45 p.m. The duo also finished out the day with a strong performance in the distance medley relay.  Delvo and Sudbury teamed with senior Cassie Lohmeier (East Peoria, Ill./East Peoria) and junior Kyela Specht (Munster, Ind./Munster) to finish third in the distance medley relay with a time of 11:56.98 for the fifth-best time in school history.  Sophomore Elizabeth Dutcher (Williamston, Mich./Williamston) capped off a busy day with a personal best in the pentathlon (3,218 points).  She was 12th in the high jump with a career-best of 1.53 meters (5-00.25) for the sixth-best effort in school history and also had a career-best toss in the shot put at 9.06 meters (29-08.75) to take 16th.  In addition to posting a personal-best time in the 800 meters, her career-best long jump of 5.32 meters (17-05.5) was good for 15th.  Dutcher’s leap was the best at Bradley since 1984 and ranks seventh in school history. In addition to the finals of the 800 meters and mile, Bradley is slated to compete in the 3,000 meters (3:45 p.m.) and the 4x400 meter relay (4:40 p.m.) Sunday to conclude action at the MVC Indoor Track and Field Championship.
