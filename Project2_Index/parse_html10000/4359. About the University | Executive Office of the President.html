Research that Improves the Human Condition From planetary science to medicine to the arts, UA research is changing the world. Being ranked #16 by the National Science Foundation doesn’t just make us great; it creates great opportunities for students. Our researchers teach. Students work alongside world-class professors to discover new knowledge and launch their own careers. Prestigious Faculty Nobel and Pulitzer Prize winners, members of esteemed national academies and world-renowned experts in dozens of disciplines, our faculty brings international attention to the University, and puts us in the ranks of the top public universities in the nation.
