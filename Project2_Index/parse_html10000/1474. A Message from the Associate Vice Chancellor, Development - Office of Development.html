Ways to Give Other Links Points of Pride DevNet Office of Development A MESSAGE FROM THE ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR, DEVELOPMENT The Promise Continues … Associate Vice Chancellor Beverly Colgate The UC Santa Barbara campus strives for excellence on many fronts. We are a leader in undergraduate and graduate teaching, ground-breaking interdisciplinary research, and impactful public service that seeks to change the world. The University of California has a continued promise to ensure access to the highest quality affordable education for the students of California while also conducting cutting-edge research that serves society at large. It is the participation and generosity of our alumni, parents, and friends that not only sustains the University in an environment of dwindling State funding, but also creates that margin of excellence which facilitates exemplary academic programming and services to students, the community, and the state of California. Your advocacy for the University is crucial to our continued growth and success. Our alumni serve as leaders and educators in their communities and are one of the greatest testaments to the value of a University of California education. The UC Santa Barbara Development Office advances the University’s mission through outreach and relationship-building with individuals, corporations and foundations to generate sustained and growing philanthropic giving for a myriad of campus programs and initiatives, each advancing educational, research, and public service priorities. Actively engaging donors with the University is a key priority for the Development operation. The Campaign for UC Santa Barbara has set a goal of raising $1-billion in private support for the campus. Thanks to the generosity of our donors and the leadership of our Foundation Trustees, this comprehensive campaign has reached $973-million toward this goal. This generosity has helped UC Santa Barbara enter the top tier of universities worldwide. Our UCSB Annual Fund generates unrestricted support for the University, while our Development staff works with donors to match their interests with campus needs in ways that help almost every area of campus. Such gifts not only sustain, but serve to transform our campus. The UCSB Development Office is the 2013 recipient of two CASE (Council for Advancement and Support of Education) awards for outstanding performance in fundraising, and continues its dedication to the pursuit of reconnecting alumni, parents and friends through meaningful and passionate involvement and giving. I encourage all of our alumni, parents and friends to join the Campaign effort and help to continue our legacy of excellence, opportunity, and innovation — and ensure a campus ranked academically among the most prestigious in the country. The UC Santa Barbara Foundation is a non-profit corporation organized under IRS 501(c)(3), and receives and manages private gifts on behalf of the University.
