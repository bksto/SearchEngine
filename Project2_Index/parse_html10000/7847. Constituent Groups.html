These opportunities organize UCSB alumni in efforts that benefit the members of the organization, the UCSB Alumni Assocation, the UCSB campus and the UC system at large. The events are social and educational in nature and are planned by volunteer leaders in each constituent group. Membership in an alumni constituent group is a benefit of membership in the UCSB Alumni Association. .
