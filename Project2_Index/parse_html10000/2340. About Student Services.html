Students are the heart of the University and an integral part of our campus. Students, take advantage of the many services available across the campus to help you succeed academically, find a home and get involved with student life, have fun and forge lasting friendships, and grow as leaders and future professionals. For students, this means the basics like getting financial aid, housing, health services, and possibly a job or internship. But it also includes efforts to make every student feel important within the campus community and create access to tools to help them grow as scholars. Students are important contributors to research and innovation, catalysts for change and advocates for social justice, and problem-solvers and leaders for the future. We offer many support services for students, and faculty and staff across the campus are working together to ensure student success in and out of the classroom to improve retention and graduation rates. We are committed to diversity and excellence and creating a positive and inclusive environment for all students. We understand the changing needs of students and strive to serve them better.
