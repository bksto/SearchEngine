She also made a key discovery about nuclear fission. In the 1950s, women were often faced with stark choices: “At that time, women teachers in the U.S. at all levels were expected to resign if they married, so I proclaimed boldly that I would never teach,” she said. “I vowed to follow Marie Curie’s model, to marry if I wanted and have children if I chose.” In the 1950s when she sought a research position in the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the radiochemistry goup, she was told, “We don’t hire women in that division.” Undeterred, Dr. Hoffman got the position and became a division leader of the isotope and nuclear chemistry division, the first woman to head a scientific division there.  For Hoffman, nuclear chemistry is a uniquely fundamental form of research, one that probes the deepest nature of what we call matter. But she adds, “There is also an array of practical issues that require the expertise of nuclear chemists—new and safer nuclear reactor designs, better medical diagnostics and radio-pharmaceuticals, more sensitive techniques for detecting proliferation, safer nuclear waste storage and environmental remediation, to name but a few. The field is wide open—there are many great discoveries yet to be made.” #chemistry #science #uc berkeley #nuclear #elements #radiochemistry #darleane hoffman #berkeley lab #lbnl #los alamos #llnl 223 notes, 2 days ago GM workers don’t have to pay for the machines they use.

Early in human history, awe was reserved for feelings toward divine beings – e.g., gods. In 1757, a revolution in our understanding of awe began thanks to Irish philosopher Edmund Burke. In A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, Burke detailed how we feel the sublime (awe) not just during religious ritual or in communion with God, but in everyday perceptual experiences: in hearing thunder, in being moved by music, in seeing repetitive patterns of light and dark. Awe was to be found in daily life. So what does awe do for you in the present moment?  Awe may be important for good health. The focus for UC Berkeley psychologist Dacher Keltner is on one branch of the immune system known as the cytokine system. Cytokines are chemical messengers that are often produced by cells in damaged tissue. Many cytokines elicit an inflammatory response, which is important for killing pathogens and healing wounds.  Psychology is discovering that a hyperactive cytokine response renders the individual chronically sick and vulnerable to disease, a process that may be involved in how poverty shortens lives. Jennifer Stellar from Keltner’s lab recently documented that of all the positive emotions humans experience, only awe predicted reduced levels of cytokines. Though this is still quite speculative, it raises the possibility that some of the pernicious effects of poverty are due to awe deprivation. “That awe, wonder and beauty promote healthier levels of cytokines suggests that the things we do to experience these emotions – a walk in nature, losing oneself in music, beholding art – has a direct influence upon health and life expectancy,” said Keltner.  Why Do We Feel Awe? → #awe #sublime #psychology #science #nature #cytokine #uc berkeley #dacher keltner 192 notes, 1 week ago There are several different ways that migrant farmworkers are categorized that play into their work and their lives and their bodies not being valued as much. One example is how legal professionals or the media talk about “skilled” and “unskilled” labor. Strawberry pickers are classified as unskilled labor, but my experience picking next to them is that they are very skilled and they are very fast, whereas I was very unskilled in that situation. Our society appears to value certain types of people and certain types of labor more, and it does not appear to value the labor that goes into our food. — Dr. Seth Holmes, UC Berkeley While researching for his book, Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States, Dr. Holmes spent more than a year and half with migrant farmworkers from Mexico — traveling, living and working alongside them as they crossed back and forth between Oaxaca (in Southern Mexico) and the United States.

So what makes a successful relationship? Psychologist Robert Levenson (known for his work on the “marry me” gene) and his team at UC Berkeley had a hunch that the key to a relationship’s stability was the ability to deal with conflict. So they gathered 156 middle-aged couples who had been married a long time. Every five years, these couples came to the lab and the researchers watched them interact and resolve arguments (while monitoring different physiological markers): "When we started, we were convinced that it was all going to be about regulating the husband’s [emotional] temperature because men tend to get uncomfortable with conflict and want to solve it quickly. That was our hunch, but it turned out to be just the opposite. Couples who seemed to get happier over the 20-year study were those who could regulate the wife’s emotions." [1] The interesting thing was that it didn’t matter how quickly the husband cooled down after an argument, but it made a lot of difference how quickly the wife cooled down. So is this a gender thing? Levenson isn’t certain that the results indicate gender differences.  The BIG caveat is that this is only a group of 156 couples (of a particular place and generation, with particular educational, ethnic, and religious backgrounds):     "In these groups there tends to be a confounding of gender with power.  So in many of these marriages the husband has more power.  In the older group they may have that because they’re the one who is more likely to have had a career. And so we’re often not sure with these kinds of findings whether it has to do with women or it has to do with the person in the relationship who has less power.” Levenson has also done research with same-sex couples (some of the only studies of this kind). In male/male and female/female couples, he noticed a similar pattern where the more powerful person ended up looking like the male in heterosexual relationships. Power and the desire to change a relationship were more powerful factors than a person’s gender. The person with less power tends to want more change in the relationship. They tend to be more frustrated and less satisfied when the issues they raise aren’t resolved. ”It would be quite reasonable to think that the less powerful person would be the one for whom cooling down would be more critical,” he explains.

With this in mind, UC Berkeley’s Robert Levenson embarked on a 20 year study.  For the study, he looked at a particular gene that’s involved in the regulation of serotonin in the brain. A variation of this gene — known as the “short allele” — leaves serotonin in the brain a bit longer and seems to amplify a person’s emotional reactions. (About 30% of the population has this variation.) People with the short alleles laugh more when they watch funny films. They also get more embarrassed (the researchers tested this out by having the study participants perform karaoke and then watch the tape of themselves singing).    At every emotional fork in the road, the people with the short alleles had an emotional reactions that was just a little bit stronger than people with long alleles.  Learn more about how this gene can impact your love life → #serotonin #psychology #genes #dna #science #emotions #emotional #genetics #robert levenson #uc berkeley 497 notes, 3 weeks ago The influence of fatherhood on the science of Charles Darwin Happy Birthday Charles Darwin! There are drawings in Charles Darwin’s manuscripts that defy explanation — until we remember that Darwin and his wife Emma had a huge family of ten (rambunctious) children. Scholars believe that a young Francis Darwin —the naturalist’s son— drew this on the back of Darwin’s manuscript for On the Origin of Species. UC Berkeley psychologist Dacher Keltner has noted that Darwin’s family life may have inspired some of his scientific writing. When his daughter Annie died at age 10, Darwin started to have deep insights about the place of suffering and compassion in human experience. That led him to argue, in The Descent of Man, that sympathy is our strongest instinct, sometimes stronger than self-interest, and he argued that it would spread through natural selection, for “the most sympathetic members, would flourish best, and rear the greatest number of offspring.”  This point was totally forgotten by evolutionary science for quite some time. Well, given all the awful things humans do to each other, how could you make the case that sympathy is our strongest instinct? The answer lies in the dependence and vulnerability of our children. Little baby chimpanzees eat by themselves; human babies can’t. Baby chimpanzees sit up on their own; you sit up a human baby, and they go, “Watch out, man, my head’s really big!” Boom! Their heads are so big because their brains are so big. To fit their big heads through the human birth canal—which narrowed as we started to walk upright on the African savanna—our babies were born profoundly premature and dependent upon people to take care of them. In fact, our babies are the most vulnerable offspring on the face of the Earth. And that simple fact changed everything. It rearranged our social structures, building cooperative networks of caretaking, and it rearranged our nervous systems. We became the super caregiving species, to the point where acts of care improve our physical health and lengthen our lives. We are born to be good to each other. The vulnerability of our children transformed human relationships and made compassion essential to our survival → (via ucresearch) #darwin day #charles darwin #darwin #uc berkeley #parenting 471 notes, 3 weeks ago How genes can affect your love life An enduring mystery of love: what makes one partner so attuned to the emotional climate in a relationship and another so oblivious?

Are some people genetically predisposed to stay happily married? Researchers at UC Berkeley have found a major clue in our DNA. Robert Levenson and his team have found a link between relationship fulfillment and a gene variant — known as the “short allele” — of the serotonin transporter gene. The gene is involved in the regulation of serotonin in the brain and can predict whether a person is attuned or oblivious to the emotional climate of their marriage. In the study, Levenson found that participants with the short alleles were most unhappy in their marriages when there was a lot of negative emotion —like contempt— but were also happiest when positive emotions like humor were present. (About 30% of the population has this gene variation.) On the other end of the spectrum, participants with long alleles were satisfied with their marriages regardless of the emotional atmosphere. #science #genes #dna #love #relationships #marriage #serotonin #uc berkeley #cal #emotions 231 notes, 3 weeks ago ucfoodobserver: Two UC Berkeley professors are studying wild edibles in the East Bay’s food deserts; there’s also a publicly accessible interactive map so urban foragers can find nutritious snacks in the wild.

Do you like both equally….or (for shame!) neither of the above? A web-based survey of more than 1,000 pet owners nationwide analyzed key personality traits and nurturing styles of people who identified as a ‘cat person’, a “dog person”, “both” of “neither”.  Those who possessed the most affection for their pets also rated among the most conscientious and neurotic - suggesting that the very qualities that make for overbearing parents (often ridiculed as ‘helicopter parents’) may actually work best for our canine and feline companions.   Mikel Delgado, a doctoral student in psychology at ucberkeley, is co-author of the study: The fact that higher levels of neuroticism are associated with affection and anxious attachment suggests that people who score higher on that dimension may have high levels of affection and dependence on their pets, which may be a good thing for pets. Previous studies focused on people’s attachment to their pets, but this is the first U.S. study to incorporate the principles of human attachment theory with pet owners’ personality types (including whether they identify as “dog person” or “cat person”). It’s also the first of its kind to find a positive correlation between human neuroticism, anxious attachment and the care of and affection for pets.   Read more → #cats #dogs #psychology #parenting #ucberkeley #pets #animals #uc berkeley #ucb #neurotic 331 notes, 1 month ago Can a little bit of power turn you into cookie monster? There’s an old quote,”power tends to corrupt — absolute power corrupts absolutely.” And while we’ve all seen obvious examples of this, is there really something to it? Psychologist Dacher Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley found that there is — and he did so by conducting what’s since been called the ‘Cookie Monster Study’. "We brought in three people to the lab. We pointed to one person and we said you’re in charge and so that person kind of felt powerful. And they they had to do this really boring task. We bring a plate of chocolate chip cookies and we put it on the table. Everybody takes one cookie, right? All groups always leave one cookie on the plate because you don’t want to be that last person that takes the last cookie. And lo and behold, we find high-powered people, they reach out and they take it", Keltner says. And not just take it — they even ate it differently… "Our high-powered person was more likely to eat with their mouth open, lips smacking, crumbs literally falling onto their sweaters. It’s ridiculous!" With increased power came less listening, more talking and weaker inhibitions.

The term “power” often evokes images of force and coercion. Many people assume that power is most evident on the floor of the United States Congress or in corporate boardrooms. Treatments of power in the social sciences have followed suit, zeroing in on clashes over cash (financial wealth), votes (participation in the political decision making process), and muscle (military might). But there are innumerable exceptions to this definition of power: a penniless two year old pleading for (and getting) candy in the check-out line at the grocery store, one spouse manipulating another for sex, or the success of nonviolent political movements in places like India or South Africa. Viewing power as cash, votes, and muscle blinds us to the ways power pervades our daily lives. New psychological research has redefined power, and this definition makes clear just how prevalent and integral power is in all of our lives. In psychological science, power is defined as one’s capacity to alter another person’s condition or state of mind by providing or withholding resources—such as food, money, knowledge, and affection—or administering punishments, such as physical harm, job termination, or social ostracism. This definition de-emphasizes how a person actually acts, and instead stresses the individual’s capacity to affect others. Perhaps most importantly, this definition applies across relationships, contexts, and cultures. It helps us understand how children can wield power over their parents from the time they’re born, or how someone—say, a religious leader—can be powerful in one context (on the pulpit during a Sunday sermon) but not another (on a mind numbingly slow line at the DMV come Monday morning). By this definition, one can be powerful without needing to try to control, coerce, or dominate. Indeed, when people resort to trying to control others, it’s often a sign that their power is slipping. This definition complicates our understanding of power. Power is not something limited to power-hungry individuals or organizations; it is part of every social interaction where people have the capacity to influence one another’s states, which is really every moment of life. Claims that power is simply a product of male biology miss the degree to which women have obtained and wielded power in many social situations. In fact, studies I’ve conducted find that people grant power to women as readily as men, and in informal social hierarchies, women achieve similar levels of power as men. So power is not something we should (or can) avoid, nor is it something that necessarily involves domination and submission. We are negotiating power every waking instant of our social lives. When we seek equality, we are seeking an effective balance of power, not the absence of power. We use it to win consent and social cohesion, not just compliance. To be human is to be immersed in power dynamics.  Read more about the paradox of power → #science #psychology #power #berkeley #uc berkeley #dacher keltner 128 notes, 1 month ago Older → © 2012–2015 | Powered by Tumblr Chrono Theme by UltraLinx
