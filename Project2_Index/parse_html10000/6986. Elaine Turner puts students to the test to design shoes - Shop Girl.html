  Shop Girl Shop smart and look fabulous with Joy Sewing Elaine Turner puts students to the test to design shoes Posted on June 5, 2014 | By Joy Sewing Print — Elaine Turner is helping design students put their best foot forward. Actually, the Houston-based accessories designer recently celebrated the University of Houston’s Industrial Design Sophomore Footwear Project called “Off the Beaten Path.” The students designed and created prototypes of Elaine Turner shoes inspired by her spring collection.  The students were judged by Turner herself on the best shoe designs. The winners - Aaron McEuen and Jason Yang – each received an internship with Turner’s Design Dream Team for the summer. Ironically, both winners are young men. Perhaps, there’s a Manolo Blahnik in the making? Other University of Houston students participating: Jenny Trieu, Kasey Rowe, Arturo Barrera, Richard Woodard, Micah Simon, Abizer Raja, Daniela Barrios Reyna and John Proffitt. Pretty cool.     Categories: Designers, Events, General Tags: design | Elaine Turner | fashion | shoes | University of Houston Print — Joy Sewing Comments are closed.
