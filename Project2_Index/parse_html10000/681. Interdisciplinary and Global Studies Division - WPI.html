WPI was listed as having the second "Most Popular Study Abroad Program," up from sixth place last year. Goucher College had the top spot in that category, while Dartmouth College, Union College, and Tufts University were in the top 10. Read more... Degree Requirement Changes Students, and the World Typically for the junior year, students complete a project that solves real problems that lie at the interface of science, technology, social issues, and human needs. All are impressive. A few are judged as standouts. Watch the video. Solving Problems Around the Corner and Around the World At our more than 40 international Project Centers, WPI students pursue hands-on, life-changing project opportunities throughout the world—close to campus, across the U.S., or as far away as Africa, Asia, Australasia, and Europe. Having a Practical Impact What goes on in an Interactive Qualifying Project? Hear the experiences of students who worked on projects that took them to Australia to adapt science-education programs for visually impaired students, and to perform forensics on a mock crime scene. Making a Real Difference Means Experiencing the Real World Those who step up to take on the world’s greatest challenges must be armed with practical experience and know-how. That’s why WPI pioneered a project-based approach whereby students apply theory to practice in every aspect of their education. Two central examples of this are the Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) and Global Projects Program (GPP), both administered by WPI’s Interdisciplinary and Global Studies Division (IGSD). The IGSD is an academic unit focused on sustainability studies and interdisciplinary educational research that exemplify WPI’s commitment to theory and practice. The IQP gives every WPI student the experience of working in teams to resolve a problem or need that lies at the meeting point of science and society. Through the GPP, WPI students may complete an IQP, Major Qualifying Project (MQP), or Humanities & Arts Project at a WPI Project Center around the globe. IGSD combines these unique educational programs with a research emphasis on local and regional sustainable development, and a focus on the strategies and needs of state and local governmental and non-governmental agencies.   Create Your Own Major The IGSD also administers the Individually Designed Major, which allows students to construct and tailor their own program geared to their personal interests and career aspirations.
