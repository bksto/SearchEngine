Engaged Research occurs when a reciprocal university-community partnership identifies, investigates, and solves a societal problem for mutual benefit of both the university and the community. Outcomes of the research lead to improved, evidence-based practice for the public good. Engaged Teaching occurs when learning opportunities happen in community-based environments. This includes service learning, internships, clinical experience, field trips, or practicums to enhance the student’s educational experience while simultaneously contributing to the public good. Engaged Service occurs when a faculty member as a subject matter expert partners with a community organization for mutual benefit. This can include lending research expertise about a specific issue, serving on a board (private or public), offering research-based policy recommendations to legislators at a committee hearing, or providing expertise through the media for the benefit of the public good. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
