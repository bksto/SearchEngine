It ties us to the environment and reminds us that we’re all connected. At Aramark Higher Education, we have a deep respect for and commitment to protecting and improving the environment. We work to reduce our environmental footprint while delivering exceptional operational results. We also offer expertise and practical solutions to our campus partners to help them reduce their environmental impacts. We develop and implement long-term environmental stewardship programs and policies within the areas of sustainable food; green buildings; waste stream management; responsible procurement; energy and water conservation; and transportation. We call these programs and policies Green Thread as they weave throughout our business operations every day!     Sustainable Food: We understand the power and centrality of food in our daily lives and interactions, and recognize that our food choices have a significant impact on our health, culture, environment, and local and global economies.  We are committed to fostering new connections from field to fork and changing the culture of food by nourishing our guests with menus that emphasize fresh whole foods that are raised, grown, harvested and produced locally and/or sustainable wherever possible, and prepared in ways that respect and maintain quality, freshness and pureness. Green Buildings: The built environment represents the largest consumer of precious natural resources, and its operation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. That is why we embrace the ideals, in concept and practice, of the design, construction and operation of high performance buildings.  We assure that the spaces we create and operate are increasingly environmentally friendly, energy efficient and healthy for those who use them. Waste Stream Management: We view the responsible management of waste as a requirement to sustain and restore our natural resources as well as the communities in which we serve. We are committed to minimizing our environmental footprint by fostering a culture that reduces, reuses, and recycles waste. To support closed-loop waste management processes, our innovative practices include partnering with suppliers who share our vision, working to reduce source packaging, enabling recovery and reuse of discarded materials, and recycling waste to create raw materials for other purposes. We are always seeking new and innovative ways to minimize our environmental footprint. Energy & Water Conservation: The energy and water we consume are finite natural resources, and contributes to climate change, health & well being, and the environmental quality in the communities we serve.  We advocate and employ energy and water management efforts to reduce consumption, preserve scarce resources, and reduce our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and water shortages.  We advocate for renewable energy sources and water recapture to reduce our overall environmental footprint. Responsible Procurement: The environmental impacts of our purchasing practices and how we operate our business every day are important. We seek to purchase and use environmentally preferable products and services, and recognize suppliers who reduce environmental impacts in their production and distribution systems or services. We partner with our suppliers, customers, and environmental experts to understand the impacts of available products and services on the environment and communities and to identify better solutions and alternatives. Transportation: We rely on vehicles to deliver products and services to our many customer locations. We recognize that reducing our fuel use and emissions will have a substantial impact on costs and the environment. We partner with our suppliers, vehicle manufacturers, clients, and governmental organizations to educate our employees on environmental impacts, develop ways to improve operational efficiency, and implement new technologies when feasible.
