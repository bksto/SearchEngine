They are attracted by the university's academic reputation, moderate weather conditions, and excellent physical accessibility offered here. The lay of the land is flat and free from environmental barriers and most physical structures are accessible. In addition, the UCSB campus provides excellent barrier free, modified, residential facilities to those students seeking to live on campus. Providing academic accommodations to students with disabilities is a shared responsibility of the campus. Students with disabilities are responsible for ensuring that the Disabled Students Program (DSP) is aware of their disabilities and for providing DSP with appropriate documentation. DSP is located in 2120 Student Resource Building and serves as the campus liaison regarding issues and regulations related to students with disabilities. The DSP staff works in an advisory capacity with a variety of campus departments to ensure that equal access is provided to all disabled students. Students with disabilities attending UCSB can be assured of receiving the same core support academic services offered throughout the University of California's System-wide chain of campuses.
