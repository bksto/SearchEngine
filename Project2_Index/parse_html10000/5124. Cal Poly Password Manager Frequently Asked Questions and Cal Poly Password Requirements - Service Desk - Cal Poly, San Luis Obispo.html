If the stored password is incorrect, the device may fail to log in too many times and trigger the temporary account lock.   This commonly occurs when a user has changed their password, but forgotten to update the saved password on their device. To prevent this, update each device with your new password.     Typical places where your password will need to be updated include: “Settings” for Cal Poly email “WiFi” for Secure Mustang Wireless.
