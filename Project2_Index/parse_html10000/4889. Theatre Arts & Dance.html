The Theatre & Dance program helps to guide its students toward creativity in their artistic and technical endeavors as well as heightening their theatrical sensibilities. Accredited by the National Association of Schools of Theatre (NAST), our department participates regularly in the American College Theatre Festival. We are members of both the California Educational Theatre Association (CETA) and the Southern California Educational Theatre Association (SCETA). Moreover, our actors vie each year for national recognition by auditioning for both the University/Resident Theatre Association (U/RTA) and the League of Professional Theatres (LORT). Many of our Theatre & Dance graduates become actors, directors and producers in Theatre, Television and Film. Considering that CSU, Dominguez Hills is no more than 10-15 miles away from Hollywood, it is certainly no surprise that our students would be engaging in acting roles even as they work toward their Bachelor's degree. Fortunately, the Theatre & Dance department is highly thought of in entertainment circles and we continually receive requests from agents and studios for the services of our students. The university at Dominguez Hills is one of the 22 California State University campuses, and offers an attractive park-like, friendly atmosphere. Located in Carson, California, minutes away from downtown Los Angeles and South Bay beaches, the campus offers its own life, and recently became the home of the L.A. Galaxy at the Home Depot Center. Dominguez is known for its generally small classes, affording students the benefits of individual attention from faculty. CSUDH is also the most diverse campus in the West, which includes not only Asian/Pacific, Hispanic and African-American students, but also 62% women and strong attendance by older students. With its up-to-date facilities, excellent faculty and staff, accessible parking and close proximity to freeways and airports, Dominguez Hills has become an attractive alternative to other larger universities. We hope you will enjoy learning more about our programs by surfing through our web site, and feel free to call or email us with your questions. Donis Leonard, M.F.A.
