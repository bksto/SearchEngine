English Proficiency Non-native English speakers who have not completed a bachelor's or master's degree in the U.S. should submit scores from a recognized English proficiency test. The Kellstadt Graduate School of Business accepts results from TOEFL, IELTS and the Pearson Test of English (PTE).

Such applicants admitted to the combined KGSB/ELA Program will begin their studies in the English Language Academy (ELA) for language improvement while conditionally admitted to the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business (KGSB). All such students must successfully complete the ELA’s University Bridge Certificate prior to enrollment in Kellstadt classes. There are two ways for students to be considered for the combined Kellstadt/ELA: English Proficiency Exam To apply for admission using English Proficiency, a student must present one of the following scores: 55-89 on the iBT TOEFL exam 480-576 on the paper-based TOEFL exam 5.5-6.0 on the IELTS exam 42-58 on the PTE exam ELA Placement Test Students whose language skills do not meet the above English proficiency standards may still qualify for conditional admission based on their performance on the Preliminary ELA Placement Test. The ELA Placement Test is available online at http://ela.depaul.edu/docs/docs/Application_Essay_Form.pdf. Prospective students seeking admission to the Kellstadt/ELA program under this option should submit both their ELA Placement Test and Kellstadt Graduate School of Business application directly to the Office of Admissions for the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business.
