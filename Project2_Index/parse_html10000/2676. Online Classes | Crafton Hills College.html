Online Online courses are identical in content to traditional face-to-face courses, however there are no regularly scheduled on-campus meetings. Courses are conducted completely online. Students complete scheduled assignments/activities with due dates, but may read (watch or listen to) lectures at their own pace and often at times convenient to their schedule (within requirements of the assignments) from anywhere in the world with an Internet connection provided they meet the due dates assigned by the instructor. Hybrid Hybrid courses are also delivered via the Internet but have one or more regularly scheduled face-to-face meetings. Students should expect the same intensity, workload and academic demands in online and hybrid courses as in face-to-face courses. The course material and assignments will not be easier than a face-to-face course. There will be deadlines for assignments with appropriate consequences for missed or late work. Online and hybrid courses will vary from professor to professor just as traditional face-to-face courses do. Faculty will be available for assistance with coursework at regular intervals. Just as in face-to-face courses, instructors are not available 24/7. Some faculty will have virtual office hours while others will commit to responding to all email and phone messages within a prescribed period of time. Check your course syllabus to learn how and when to contact your instructor. The San Bernardino Community College District has adopted the use of Blackboard as its course management system. Blackboard is an online site that hosts the class and provides you with information and opportunities to communicate with the instructor and the rest of the class. Many instructors at Crafton Hills College also teach their traditional face-to-face courses as a web-enhanced course. In these courses the instructor supplements regular instruction with required online learning materials provided through Blackboard. Your instructor will notify you the first day if their class is web-enhanced. Online Classes Browse Online Courses Bookstore FAQ Is Online Right for Me?
