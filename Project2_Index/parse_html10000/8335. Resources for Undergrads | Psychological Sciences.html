Major and Minor Information   Requirements for the bachelor of arts in psychology Requirements for the minor in psychology Psychology course descriptions UC Merced General Catalog What Can You Do With Your Degree? The psychology major prepares students for graduate school, as well as for many careers that do not require further graduate training. The American Psychological Association has an excellent website to help you understand the job market. APA reports that about 5 percent of those who earned bachelor's degree in psychology in 1997 and 1998 had taken jobs that were actually in psychology. Most psychology major graduates — about two-thirds — took employment in private sector business settings. Graduates with psychology degrees are highly marketable because they are trained to have good research and writing skills, to be effective problem-solvers in both team and individual settings, and to use critical thinking skills to analyze, synthesize and evaluate information. Specific examples of employment include administrative support, public affairs, education, business, sales, service industries, health, the biological sciences, computer programming, employment counselors, correction counselor trainees, interviewers, personnel analysts, probation officers and writers. The same APA report finds that two-thirds of psychology major graduates believe their jobs are closely or somewhat related to their psychology background and that their jobs hold career potential. Undergraduate Research Opportunities Below you will find a list of the research labs in the Psychological Sciences program. If you are interested in working in a particular lab, email the contact listed directly. Research spots in labs are limited and require students who are dedicated and interested in the subject field. Please do not contact professors about openings if none are available. However, check back with the website frequently as a lab's status can change at any time. If you are planning to enroll in Independent Study (e.g., PSY 95, PSY 195), there is a form titled "Independent Study Enrollment" that you need to fill out and turn in. This form is available at the Students' First Center or can be printed out. Unlike regular classes, there is no online registration for Independent Study. The document must be signed by the professor in charge of the research lab. Keep in mind that a minimum of three hours of work per week is required for each unit of Independent Study.  Research Labs in Developmental Psychology Lab: Professor Jeff Gilger E-mail: jgilger@ucmerced.edu Room: SSM 306B Website: http://faculty2.ucmerced.edu/jgilger/ Research: My Ph.D. training is in developmental psychology and behavioral genetics. I also have a master's of science in clinical child-school psychology. My scholarship is inherently multidisciplinary. My teaching and research has tended to focus on normal and abnormal neuropsychological development, genetics and the etiology of learning-language disorders. Ongoing research projects include the neurology/genetics of the gifted-reading disabled individual, the use of computer programs to stimulate learning, the long-term effects of subtle brain damage in school-aged sports and the etiology of spatial giftedness. Research Assistant openings: Yes, on a competitive basis based on match and experience. Nature of work: Undergraduate research assistants will have the opportunity to be engaged in a variety of projects depending on their experience and interests. There is also a need for help in general housekeeping work, such as lab organization, library or online research, data analysis and graphics creation. The lab is just starting up, but there will be work opportunities soon for studies on gifted dyslexics, and other subjects. Students should expect to regularly attend lab meetings. Expected time commitment: Can be taken for course credit. Hours to be arranged.

Specifically, I am interested in the development of empathy and emotion regulation and how these processes are shaped by temperament, family, and culture.  I am currently working on projects investigating communication of empathy between parents and adolescents, how cultural orientations influence family emotional communication, and the implications of these processes for psychological and physical health. Research assistant opening: Yes. Nature of work: Undergraduate research assistants may be involved in a variety of tasks, including testing subjects, engaging in scholarly readings, interacting with and recruiting families from the community, video coding, and data management. Expected time commitment: Students are expected to work 6-9 hours/week and are required to attend regular lab meetings. Lab: Professor Rose Scott E-mail: rscott@ucmerced.edu Room: SSM 137 Website: http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/rscott/CECL/ Research: My lab conducts research in how children between 1 and 4 years of age make sense of other people's behavior, as well as how they learn their native languages. My studies typically involve showing children short videos or picture books and coding where the children look at key points. This can tell us how they interpret what they see and hear. Research assistant opening: A limited number of research openings are available on a competitive basis each semester. All openings are filled before the start of the semester. Applications for the summer and fall are due by April 30 and applications for spring are due by Dec. 1 each year. Contact Professor Scott for an application. Nature of work: Research assistants assist in recruiting participants, running experimental studies and coding experimental data. Assistants need to be very detail oriented, as well as capable of interacting with parents and children. Expected time commitments: Students can volunteer or enroll for course credit. Students are expected to work about three hours a week for each credit hour (i.e. 3 credits = nine hours a week). Students can enroll for either 2 or 3 credits. Lab: Professor Eric Walle E-mail: ewalle@ucmerced.edu Room: SSM 141 Website: http://idlab.ucmerced.edu Research: Our lab investigates aspects of psychological development relating to social and emotional processes in infancy. Specifically, we are interested in how the developing infant appreciates the emotional communication of others, and how this capacity guides infants' behavioral responding in social contexts. We are also interested in how infant social capacities change following the onset of walking, including language development, exploration of the environment and social interactions. This research typically involves bringing infants and caregivers to the lab to participate in naturalistic experiments. Research assistant openings: Yes, on a competitive basis based on match of interests and relevant experience. Nature of work: Research assistants participate in every part of the research process. This includes testing participants, monitoring testing, participant recruitment, data management and data coding. Research assistants are also responsible for engaging in scholarly readings, conducting reviews of the literature and attending mandatory laboratory meetings. Expected time commitment: Students may volunteer or enroll for course credit (1 unit = three work hours/week). Most students are expected to work in the lab approximately nine hours per week. Research Labs in Health Psychology Lab: Professor Linda Cameron E-mail: lcameron@ucmerced.edu Room: SSM 309 Website: www.cameronhcilab.com/lab Research: My research focuses on using new psychological advances in cognition, imagery and emotion to develop effective health communications for promoting health behaviors and coping with chronic illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. Research topics include smoking prevention, coping with cancer and heart disease and promoting healthy behaviors such as physical activity. Research assistant openings: Yes, on a competitive basis based on match and experience. Nature of work: Undergraduate research assistants are engaged in a variety of projects depending on their experience and learning interests.

Research assistant openings: No Research Labs in Quantitative Psychology Lab: Professor Sarah Depaoli E-mail: sdepaoli@ucmerced.edu Room: SSM 320 Research: The research focus in this lab is generally on creating and refining statistical tools used in a variety of research settings. The primary focus is on latent variable growth models, which are used to assess change across unobserved groups over time. We are also heavily involved with issues surrounding the use of the Bayesian estimation framework and how this framework might affect the estimation of certain latent variable models. Research assistant openings: No Lab: Professor William R. Shadish E-mail: wshadish@ucmerced.edu Room: COB 385 Research: The Shadish lab generally focuses on two lines of research: meta-analysis experimental and quasi-experimental design. Within the field of meta-analysis, we are focusing on creating and testing ways to generate effect sizes for single case designs and subsequently synthesize those effect sizes. Within the field of experimental design, we are investigating ways in which to get equivalent results from non-randomized experiments (such as regression discontinuity designs) as one would get from randomized experiments. Research assistant openings: No Lab: Professor Jack L. Vevea E-mail: jvevea@ucmerced.edu Room: SSM 303 Research: The main interest in my lab is the creation of new statistical models. We do this primarily in the context of meta-analysis, a system of statistical approaches to combining information from multiple studies. We also work in the field of educational measurement, where we are involved in using item response theory to create a new vocabulary assessment for California fourth and fifth graders.
