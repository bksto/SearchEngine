Hines College of Architecture and area professionals. The MRC has developed a web-based database that catalogs the physical materials in its collection. On-going work of the MRC includes uncovering new and innovative materials, cataloging the physical samples, and researching and inputting data regarding the specific extrinsic and intrinsic properties of these materials. The MRC is also engaged in specific material research projects such as a database of local materials and carbon analysis of an office building currently under construction. This work is funded by our Founding Partners: Page Southerland Page, Kendall/Heaton, and Gensler and our supporters: Architecture Center Houston Foundation, the University of Houston Green Building Components program, Skanska USA, the University of Houston Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture and the University of Houston Faculty Development Department.
