Current Project Prioritization Listing of Active "Special Projects" for 09/26/2014 thru 02/05/2015 INPROGRESS PROJECTS FROM LAST CYCLE Priority Order Project / Description N/A N/A PRIORITIZED PROJECTS Priority Order Project / Description 1 Project: Gray Screens Description: This project is critical because SBCCD currently uses a legacy product (Desktop User Interface) that is no longer supported by the vendor.  In order to move to the current version (Web User Interface), we need to reprogram many of the current screens and report scripts that users use daily to interact with Datatel to be compatible with Web UI.  Along with security and business continuity concerns with being on an unsupported platform, Web UI also provides new features and efficiencies that will help streamline the user experience. 2 Project: Processing Scholarship Checks via Colleague Description: IRS Guidelines require SBCCD to report scholarship and grant disbursements.  Currently the process is to manually update student records in Datatel to include scholarship disbursements.  Project will automate this data entry process as well as allow staff to review scholarship disbursement information from a central source.  Currently using an Excel document for calculations and record keeping. 3 Project: Mass Email Solution Description: This project allows for the automation of a process to gather email addresses of current students and staff from Datatel and allow selected users to email those groups from their Outlook client.  The current process is manually done about 50 times per semester and automating it would free up the staff member to be more productive in other areas. 4 Project: Automation of Pre-requisite and Co-Requisite Drops Description: Currently a student who is taking a course that is a pre-requisite for another course is allowed to register for that other course while taking the pre-requisite.  If a student does not pass the pre-requisite course, the unsuccessful student is marked in the system with an asterisk.  The change requested is instead of the asterisk, the student is automatically dropped from within Datatel.  According to the project requestor, if this request is not met, the earth will cease to rotate on its axis and we will all either freeze or burn to death.  This change may be resolved with an upcoming patch from Ellucian.  We are currently working to install the numerous patches in the test environment but do not have a definitive answer at this date.   Listing of Active "Vendor Projects" for 09/26/2014 thru 02/05/2015 IMPROGRESS VENDOR PROJECTS Priority Order Project / Description N/A N/A PRIORITIZED VENDOR PROJECTS Priority Order Project / Description N/A N/A Listing of Active "Mandate/Reporting Projects" for 09/26/2014 thru 02/05/2015 IMPROGRESS PROJECTS FROM LAST CYCLE Priority Order Project / Description N/A N/A Listing of Active "Operations Projects" for 09/26/2014 thru 02/05/2015 PRIORITIZED PROJECTS Priority Order Project / Description N/A N\A Home Faculty Students Administrators & Staff Projects IT Project Prioritization Process Departments Twitter Usage Map and Directions Contact Us Copyright © TESS 2009 All Rights Reserved Contact Webmaster Accessibility Statement
