Joining a Greek organization is an excellent way to meet people, get acclimated to campus life, gain important leadership skills, have fun, and establish life-long friendships. The fraternities and sororities on our campus have various origins, including historically Latina(o) and historically African-American beginnings. While individual Greek organizations are not funded by the Associated Students, Inc., their activities and events are often supported through co-sponsorships with the Office of Student Life and student groups.
