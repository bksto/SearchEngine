M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics, and Founding Director of the Institute for Genomic Biology. Professor Lewin’s current research interest is in mammalian genome evolution. He and his collaborators are studying how mammalian chromosomes evolve and the role of chromosome rearrangements in adaptation, speciation and the origins of cancer. Lewin’s earlier research in immunogenetics and comparative genomics led to the identification of a gene responsible for resistance and susceptibility to bovine leukemia virus infection, the development of high-density comparative maps for mammalian genomes, and co-discovery of a gene affecting milk fat composition. In addition, his group produced the first large-scale cattle cDNA and oligo microarrays, which were used to study the genomic effects of nuclear transfer cloning, the development and involution of the mammary gland, and the dietary effects on gene expression during the periparturient period. Lewin is Founding co-Editor of Annual Reviews of Animal and Veterinary Biosciences, Section Editor of the journal Animal Biotechnology and has served on the Editorial Board of Physiological Genomics and Annual Reviews of Genomics and Human Genetics. In 2004, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 2007 he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry.
