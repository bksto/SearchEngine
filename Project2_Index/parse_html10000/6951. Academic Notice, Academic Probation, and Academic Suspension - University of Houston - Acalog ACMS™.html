Students who entered under a previous catalog will be held to these standards. FTIC students (First Time In College) who earn less than a 2.00 grade point average in the first long semester (i.e., Fall or Spring) of enrollment at the University of Houston shall be placed on academic notice and must be advised by the Academic Advising Center of Undergraduate Scholars at UH and their major departments. Second semester FTIC students (First Time In College) who have completed their first long semester and all other students whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.00 shall be placed on academic probation. They are urged to seek advising in their major departments. They may also consult the advisors in the Academic Advising Center of Undergraduate Scholars at UH. Students on academic probation whose semester or summer session grade point average is below 2.00 are placed on academic suspension. The first academic suspension is for a period of at least one long semester (fall or spring). Students placed on academic suspension for the first time at the end of a fall semester may apply for readmission for the following fall at the earliest. Students placed on academic suspension for the first time at the end of a spring semester may apply for readmission for the following spring at the earliest. Students placed on academic suspension for the first time at the end of a summer semester may apply for readmission for the following spring at the earliest. The second academic suspension is for a period of at least 12 months. After the third academic suspension, students will not be eligible to re-enroll at the University of Houston. Students on academic probation whose cumulative grade point average is below 2.00 but whose semester or summer session grade point average is 2.00 or higher will remain on academic probation. Students on academic probation will be removed from that status when their semester grade point average is 2.00 or higher and their cumulative grade point average is at or above 2.00. Summer visiting students are not subject to academic probation or suspension while in that status. If, however, they are later admitted as regular students, the grades that they earned in their summer visiting status will be included in all subsequent calculations of their cumulative grade point average at the university. Without regard to these regulations, the dean of a college may place any majors in that college whose academic records are deficient on academic probation, retain on probation, or suspension.  Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to Portfolio     All catalogs © 2015 University of Houston.
