We are a medium-sized university featuring a contemporary setting, small classes, modern and well-equipped labs and facilities, strong support services and close faculty contact. Some of San Bernardino County’s brightest high school graduates have made CSUSB their university of choice, thanks in part to our renewable President’s Academic Excellence Scholarship (PAES). Students who have ranked in the top 1 percent of their class are personally invited to attend our institution. Several of these students have already taken advantage of the treasure found in their own backyard. A similar opportunity has been extended to the top 2 percent of graduates from Riverside and San Bernardino counties through the Mathematics and Science Scholars (MASS) Program. Local students who are interested in pursuing baccalaureate degrees in the fields of mathematics, biology, computer science, chemistry, physics or geology are encouraged to apply to our university and benefit from scholarship awards and a rewarding educational experience.    You will find that our staff is ready and able to assist you as you continue to explore CSUSB. Discover that we are the best choice for you, too.
