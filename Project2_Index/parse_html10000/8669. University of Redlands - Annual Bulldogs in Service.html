The first Community Service Alumni Committee was led by Cathy Schilling ’76. The goal of this committee was to continue the community service efforts that had been embedded into their learning while a student at Redlands. BIS gives all alumni the chance to connect and reconnect with other Bulldogs while making an impact in their local community.   Past Projects The first Bulldogs in Service took place on April 2008. The inaugural year took a running start with 400 volunteers involved in 14 projects across the U.S and Salzburg, Austria.  In 2009, 16 projects took place across the country with over 700 alumni, student, and family participants. Each year continued to grow and in 2010, 25 community service projects were underway including four new locations: New Mexico, Las Vegas, New York, and Atlanta. Growth continued and 2011 moved ahead with 26 projects and nearly 500 volunteers. Last year the tradition of growth continued and in 2012 Bulldogs around the country and in Austria participated in 28 Bulldogs in Service projects making an impact not only in their hometown, but across the globe.
