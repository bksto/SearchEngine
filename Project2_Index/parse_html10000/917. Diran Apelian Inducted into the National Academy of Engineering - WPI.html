At a recent ceremony in California, Diran Apelian, Howmet Professor of Engineering at WPI and director of the WPI Metal Processing Institute, was formally inducted into the National Academy of Engineering (NAE). Apelian was elected to the academy in February. Election to the NAE is among the highest distinctions accorded to engineers. Established in 1964, the NAE consists of the nation's premier engineers, who are elected by their peers for seminal contributions to their fields. Operating under the congressional charter granted to the National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the academy provides leadership and guidance to government on the application of engineering resources to social, economic, and security problems. There are currently 2,246 NAE members. Apelian, an internationally recognized pioneer in metals research who served recently as the 52nd president of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS), was honored for "contributions to solidification processing and for outstanding leadership in engineering education and university-industry collaboration," according to the NAE.
