Completeness of Credentials: When important pieces of information, such as transcripts, are lacking, the faculty is compelled to reject the applicant. A number of applicants are rejected on this basis. Applications must be complete by December 1. The process of evaluation begins shortly after this date and interviews for invited candidates take place in either February or March. Applicants will be notified if they qualify for an interview. In-person interviews are strongly preferred; however, phone interviews can be arranged if necessary. 2. Graduate Record Examination Scores and Grade Point Average: Combined Verbal and Quantitative GRE scores of about 1200 are expected; scores on the Advanced Psychology Subject test (which is encouraged, not required) are generally in the 600's. The undergraduate grades of applicants are expected to average substantially higher than "B" in psychology courses. Typically, successful applicants to our program have undergraduate GPA's of 3.5 or better. If the student is particularly strong in one area but not another, these criteria are not followed rigidly. 3. Undergraduate Preparation: Students are expected to have had courses in statistics, experimental psychology, abnormal psychology, and other areas of psychology to permit advanced study in this field. The minimum requirement for admission is 32 quarter hours (24 semester hours) in psychology. Although not required, science, computer, and math courses are viewed positively. In addition, applied and research experience will be an important consideration in the selection process. 4. Letters of Recommendation: The letters of recommendation are reviewed carefully. Reference writers should be selected who can address the applicant's academic abilities, potential for conducting research, and ability to work with others. 5. Match to the Program: As the DePaul Clinical program is more specialized than many programs, the match of a student's career goals and experiences to the program objectives is also a significant consideration in the admission evaluation process. In applying to either the Child or Community tracks, it is helpful to mention specific interests or experiences that coincide with faculty members in that track. 6. Ethnic and Racial Minorities: The clinical faculty encourages applications from students of color. Four of the twelve full-time clinical faculty are racial minorities and seven are women. 7. Students with Disabilities: The clinical faculty encourages applications from students with disabilities.
