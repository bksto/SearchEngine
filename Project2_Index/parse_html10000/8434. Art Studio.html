Academics University of Redlands > Academics > College of Arts & Sciences > Undergraduate Studies > Art Studio Art Studio Art is a great way to exercise creativity. Students of studio art gain first hand knowledge of the creative process and learn how to put creativity to work. The conceptual and the hands on processes of making art go together in the art department. The art department provides classes in drawing, painting, photography, graphic design, printmaking, ceramics and sculpture. The department has just moved into a new 25,000-square-foot facility with state-of-the-art studios. This is a fantastic, beautiful new building with state-of-the-art digital labs for graphic design and digital photography. It also has new facilities for painting and printmaking and a new darkroom for black and white photography. We are all very excited about the opportunities this new art building will bring for us. Curriculum The Art curriculum outlined in the University of Redlands catalog articulates the balance of art and the liberal arts. Our introductory level courses are open to students with any amount of preparation. We have a foundation for learning that will prepare students for intermediate and advanced study in the discipline.  The study of studio art requires a "capstone" experience. The capstone involves creating a body of work in the student's chosen concentration area (drawing/painting, ceramics/sculpture, graphic design, photography, printmaking). In the Senior sequence of classes, students are introduced to professional art practices such as resume and grant writing, exhibit design, portfolio preparation, job search and interview skills and development of professional opportunities. The sequence culminates in the annual Senior Art Exhibition in May.
