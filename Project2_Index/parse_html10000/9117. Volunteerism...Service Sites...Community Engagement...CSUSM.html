Lifeline’s mission is to “build self-reliance among youth, individuals and families through problem- solving, skill building and accessible community- based services.” Lifeline encourages community and civic engagement to their clients, staff and volunteers.

San Pasqual Academy Project: In partnership with Dragon Organics, CSUSM volunteers will perform farm activities on our on-campus organic 14 acre farm. Activities will include planting and weeding a variety of vegetable crops plus cleaning up 2 acres around our citrus trees.  Includes using farm tools such as shovels trowels and hoes.  Activities benefit foster youth who eat the food produced on the farm in their residences and in the school cafeteria. Boys & Girls Club of Vista Project: The Boys & Girls Club is a place designed solely for youth programs and activities.   Since 1963, our mission has been to inspire and enable all boys and girls; especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as responsible, productive, and caring citizens.  The project at this site will be creating a vegetable garden and trail leading to playground. On-Campus Projects Project: Hygiene Kits to benefit Interfaith Community Services - Hygiene may seem basic, but for those who are unable to take a shower regularly, or cannot afford to purchase toothpaste, it may mean more than cleanliness. Good hygiene can help someone retain their dignity and sense of self-worth. Volunteers for this project will be sorting and packaging hygiene products. Project: Mural Projects - The Art Miles Mural Project is a passionate and colorful 12 year movement combining the efforts of children and adults worldwide to promote Global Peace and Harmony through Mural Art. Each hand and every mural aims to create & express a Global Voice to Develop and Advocate Art rather than violence, cooperation instead of war and the Continuation of Life rather than death. Participants will start and complete a mural on a 5x12 foot canvas to be exhibited on campus and shared through an intercultural mural exchange.  © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
