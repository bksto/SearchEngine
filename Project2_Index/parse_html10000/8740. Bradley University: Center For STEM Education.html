The answer is simple: math and science are primary sources of lifelong learning and the progress of our civilization. Right now, our 12th graders are dead last in science against international competition, and we’re significantly behind in math and technology also. The Center for STEM Education has been established to be the primary resource for enhancing preparation of STEM educators, administrators and professionals and be a leader in advancing the scholarship of STEM education. The Center will provide strong, visionary leadership in advancing STEM education and literacy through research and collaborative initiatives. Through training and programs, the Center will improve STEM literacy among all citizens, enhancing our society in a way we can remain competitive and maintain innovation in the global economy.
