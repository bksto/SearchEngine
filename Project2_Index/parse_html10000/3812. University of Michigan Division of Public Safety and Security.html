If you are walking, make sure you know your route. If you are getting a ride, make sure the driver stays sober. If you are driving, you are responsible for the safety of your friends. Plan ahead-take a friend Use the buddy system. Go with a trusted friend who has your best interests in mind. Stay together! Eat and stay hydrated Make sure you eat well and stay hydrated throughout the day. Alcohol can dehydrate you quickly. Leave valuables at home Make sure you don't leave valuables unattended. They best way to do that is leave them at home. It reduces the chance that they will be lost or taken from you. Stay by your drinks Even if you are not drinking alcohol, it is easy for someone to put something in your drink unless you see it opened or prepared. Keep it with you at all times. Be aware of your surroundings Don't be a victim of a crime of opportunity. Use the buddy system and be aware of what is going on around you at all times. Be extra cautious on the road If you are driving, stay sober and be an extra defensive driver-others may not be as responsible as you are. If you are walking, be aware that drivers may be distracted or intoxicated. Use extra caution whenever you are crossing a street or near vehicles in motion. Look out for your friends Even if you are aware of your surroundings, nobody can see everything all the time. Look out for the safety of your friends and talk to them about doing the same for you. Wear green so you don't get pinched You have the right not to be touched. Others may not be in control and looking for a way to violate that right. Be safe - Have fun!
