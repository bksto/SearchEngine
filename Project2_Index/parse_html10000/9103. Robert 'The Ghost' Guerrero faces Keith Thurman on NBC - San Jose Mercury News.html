He can envision a rematch with Floyd Mayweather Jr., the chance to write a blockbuster chapter to his boxing career. Guerrero, a 31-year-old Gilroy welterweight, knows none of that happens unless he deals with the here and now: Saturday night's WBA title bout against undefeated Keith Thurman at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. "He can punch. His record speaks for itself -- 21 knockouts," said Guerrero, who will pit his 32-2-1 ledger against Thurman's 24-0-0 mark in a fight that kicks off NBC's Premier Boxing Champions series on network television. "He might come in and try to bang away with me. He might come in and just try to mow me down. I'm OK with any way he comes."

Guerrero was born and raised in Gilroy. (Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group) ( Gary Reyes ) Guerrero expects Thurman, a 26-year-old from Clearwater, Florida, to be prepared. But he added, "I know I'm going to be his toughest challenge to date." Having fought once in 22 months, Guerrero said he's fresh and healthy. He has stayed in the gym and is sharp, he said. Although only weeks from turning 32, the former four-division champion can imagine boxing for five more years. But no fight can potentially open bigger doors than this one. "I know it's going to put me back in the mix," Guerrero said. "But you've got to focus on what's in front of you now, and everything else will come." What Guerrero covets next is another shot at Mayweather, who scored a decisive 12-round decision when they fought two years ago in Las Vegas. Advertisement Mayweather, of course, is scheduled to face Manny Pacquiao on May 2 in Vegas in a long-awaited showdown expected to be the richest fight in the sport's history. The Mayweather-Pacquiao contract does not guarantee a rematch, but the demand will be high, especially should Pacquiao hand Mayweather his first career defeat. Otherwise, with a victory over Pacquiao and one more fight on his six-bout contract with Showtime that he has said will mark the end of his career, what direction will Mayweather go? Guerrero and Thurman believe they could be in line for that fight, with a victory Saturday. "There's opportunity to fight the winner of that (Mayweather-Pacquiao) fight," said Robert Santos, Guerrero's co-manager. "If everything is right, I think he will give me a shot," Guerrero said. "Me and Mayweather already have history together. It's one of those fights that a lot of fans would like to see again." Guerrero is excited for the Thurman bout and said his perspective on his career has changed since his wife Casey's much-publicized fight with lymphocytic leukemia. Originally diagnosed in 2007, Casey twice suffered relapses after chemo and radiation treatments before undergoing a bone-marrow transplant in 2010. Guerrero, who briefly shelved his career to support his wife, happily reports Casey has been cancer-free for five years. Her experience provided Guerrero motivation to continue his career. "There's guys who do it just for the money and just for the fame. I love the game," Guerrero said. "I always tell people, 'My wife had no choice. She had to fight cancer. I have a choice to fight or work or do whatever.' To be able to do what you love by choice, there's nothing greater than that." Besides, he said, Casey wouldn't allow him to step away now. "To just hang it all up, she would be like, 'You're crazy.' " Follow Jeff Faraudo on Twitter at twitter.com/Jeff Faraudo.
