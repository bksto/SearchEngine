"The University of Illinois at Chicago is committed to creating and maintaining a healthy, productive environment for all its students, faculty, staff, patients and visitors," Chancellor Paula Allen-Meares and Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services Mark Donovan said in an email to the campus community March 15 that announced the policy. UIC has prohibited smoking indoors and near building entryways since 1995. Last year, discussions within a UIC committee and subcommittees led to the recommendation to make the campus tobacco-free. The policy was finalized after consultation with the University of Illinois president, UIC vice chancellors and deans, the UIC Senate, and student government organizations for undergraduate, graduate and health professions students. According to the Tobacco-Free College Campus Initiative, nearly 800 U.S. college campuses are tobacco-free or will become so in the near future. Those campuses include the City Colleges of Chicago, Rush University, College of DuPage, five Indiana University campuses, St. Louis University, all University of California campuses, University of Florida and University of Oregon. The University of Illinois campus at Urbana-Champaign will become smoke-free Jan. 1, 2014. FAQ about the UIC Tobacco-Free Campus Policy Does this mean I can't smoke anywhere on campus? As of July 1, no smoking is allowed within campus boundaries. The use of all tobacco products is prohibited on all campus grounds and buildings, in all university-owned vehicles, and in private vehicles on campus. This includes all private and public areas in student residence halls. More maps of UIC What about other tobacco products? The presence of tobacco products on campus poses a health risk for everyone at UIC. All forms of tobacco are prohibited, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes (hookahs), chew, electronic cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. How will UIC let people know about the new policy? Signs will be posted in various areas around campus and all ashtrays will be removed from university property. New students and staff will be informed of the policy at orientation. The heads of campus units will be responsible for communicating the policy to current and future students and staff.

We are confidently counting on the thoughtfulness, consideration and cooperation of smokers and nonsmokers alike. All members of the campus community — faculty, staff, students, patients and visitors — share responsibility for respecting the policy and its motivations, and for making others aware and encouraging them to comply. Concerns should be brought to the attention of the person in charge of the facility or the supervisor of the work area. Repeated violations by an individual may lead to disciplinary action.
