UCLA understands this important connection and provides extensive research support through two centers — each customized to a student's main area of study. The Center for Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences helps students improve their research skills, define academic interests and become a part of the university research community. The Center for Undergraduate Research in Sciences works to serve students and faculty in the life and physical sciences, engineering and mathematics. The center focuses on increasing the retention of science majors in all disciplines, as well as preparing students for academic and research careers.
