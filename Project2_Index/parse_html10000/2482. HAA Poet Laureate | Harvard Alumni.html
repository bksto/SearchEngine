When I got the news I was frightened. I thought of that picture Of the two flags on that single pole which Are flying away from each other – Like wings without wind, flying in the past In the room where old class reports are kept. So now I wait for you in your office And you are on the phone. Jack is listening. He tilts his head, turns, glances back at me, Returns to the call. He is listening. “I agree but it’s complicated.” I hear that voice. Why do I feel so safe? I have known this man for forty years. He wrote recommendations for me As a reformed Kirkland House reprobate. He counseled me as a young Alumnus And as the President of the Alumni. Why do I hear that voice and feel so safe? Has Jack really managed everything? In Admissions as a progressive Multiculture advocate; as Director Of Athletics he summed it up by saying: “We built lots of buildings, there weren’t any Scandals, and the teams did relatively well.” That constant modest voice. Radcliffe equal In academics and athletics joined us And then with his perfect brother, Tom He turned to raising money for the place. For fifty years he has touched each of us. Why am I troubled by divided flags Hanging on forgotten walls in frames? Down there on Mt. Auburn Street in the Square The bars and boutiques are all too bright. We grew up in a different dark out there – I return to watching Jack. He looks at me And returns to the call. “That’s a good I-deer.” What is an “I-deer” I ask myself? An ego with antlers? I’m clearly getting Hungry. Jack is on the phone. I want to ask him But I don’t know what. Through atmospheres, time And generations he has seen it all: Years ago the twenty-four seven of Hayes Bickford with its ungodly all night light And its sleeping sailors facedown drunk On their trays, the locked trolley yards became The John F. Kennedy School of Government, The Mass Hall occupation, student riots. Jack lets the speaker conclude the call. Hangs up. “Disgruntled alumnus.” He smiles at me. And then with his combination of pure Candor and perfect discretion, moves on To our, and his next Harvard discussion. I think of the flags again but now The wind becomes a metaphor. It is not Variable and blowing from all directions. What if it is constant and always Serves the flag and displays it to every Quadrant and causes the catch of the eye– That causes the mind to remember– And I think, how like Jack: The outstretched flag Reminding us, causing us to look above Ourselves and above our uncertain life And more than split flags of his past achievements I have come to know what he is to me – And more than historical monuments I know what he is to this university: You are ever present and have become The loving wind and Harvard flag as one. I ask him, “What will we do without you?” He smiles and puts his baseball cap back on. And then comes again, that steady, steady voice: "I'm not goin' anywhere…and it’ll be terrific."   The Sundial on a Rainy Day Like the southern trial lawyer that he is, Before he got started, Carl cleared his throat, Slowly surveyed the room through thick glasses Spread his hands out across the table top And brought the chatter in the room to order. “The central feature that distinguishes mankind From the other creatures on this earth Is ‘memory’ and from ‘memory’…” He pauses, looks at us and continues… “And from memory we create our past And from memory we chart our future…” Momentarily distracted I think Isn’t “memory” just what I don’t forget? And missed Carl’s comment about a sundial “In the North West corner of the Yard.” After our lunch and more of our meetings We followed tradition back to The Yard But because of the rain The Convocation Was held inside.  We  opened umbrellas Above our freshman and walked them to the Church, But once I’d seated mine, I return to the Yard. I wanted the students all to be gone So I could stand in this empty private space.   Why am I still fascinated by the History, the details of the place? So many graduate and leave it all behind Shouldn’t I have outgrown all of this? Past the puddles, I return to from where I had come.  At Lionel and Mower In the soft rain it stopped me in my tracks. There in the northwest corner of the Yard, Quite by accident, behind Holden Chapel, I found the old sundial, and I stopped to read: “On this moment hangs eternity.” And there my question was abruptly answered: The shared grey convocation, the laughter In the morning meetings, the familiar Classrooms, the old brick dorms, an old sundial, The HAA, all on this “our common ground.” That evening, back in my room at the Charles I found the sundial on the web and found a Crimson Article dated October 1925 With a quote from C.R. Apted, a sage, Superintendent of Harvard’s caretakers, Commenting on the recent shade upon the dial From the “Two new dorms, Lionel and Mower,” “It’s just as ornamental out of the sun As it was in, and about as useful.” Carl was right.  With the help of a forgotten Sundial on which I couldn’t read the time, On this “common ground” I hold so dear, I found the past and future are present here. It is memory, not the clock-like sunshine That sets the time and always lights the way.
