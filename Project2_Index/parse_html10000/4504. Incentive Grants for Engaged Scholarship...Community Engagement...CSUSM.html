Categories of fundable activities include, but are not limited to: •    Design and implementation of engaged scholarship research project or creative activity •    Development of curricular or pedagogical strategies involving engaged scholarship •    Collaboration with a community organization by providing subject matter expertise •    Travel to conference to present on an engaged scholarship project Awardees will be expected to share the outcomes with a wider audience. If funded, awardees must participate in the Celebration of Faculty Scholarship and Creative Activities at CSUSM, as well as disseminate their results in at least one other way.  Possible venues for dissemination include: Engagement Scholarship Consortium National Conference (October 2016) Faculty Center Teaching Expo Professional conference of faculty member’s choosing Forum/event hosted by community partner Selection Process: The ex officio members of the Community Engagement Faculty Advisory Council (CEFAC) will conduct a review of the proposals, based on the evaluation rubric.   Funds: The grant funds will be available for use from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016. A range of $2,000-$5,000 will be awarded per proposal. All professional development funds must be spent and all paperwork appropriately completed prior to June 30, 2016. It is the responsibility of the faculty member to follow up on any documentation/travel claims with their respective department before the deadline. *DEFINITION OF ENGAGED SCHOLARSHIP Engagement (or engaged) scholarship is defined by the collaboration between academics and individuals outside the academy— knowledge professionals and the lay public (local, regional/state, national, global)— for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. The scholarship of engagement includes explicitly democratic dimensions of encouraging the participation of non-academics in ways that enhance and broaden engagement and deliberation about major social issues inside and outside the university. It seeks to facilitate a more active and engaged democracy by bringing affected publics into problem-solving work in ways that advance the public good with and not merely for the public. ~ New England Resource Center for Higher Education (NERCHE)  **DEFINITION OF PUBLIC GOOD The term “public good” speaks to the commitment to civic [engagement] and social responsibility, to serving and protecting . . . [societal well-being].  It implies a moral obligation on the part of individuals and institutions to attend to social problems. ~ Higher Education for the Public Good: A Report from the National Leadership Dialogues *Proposer Proposer is a required field! *E-Mail E-Mail is a required field! *Phone Phone is a required field! *College College is a required field! *Department Department is a required field! *Rank as of 7/1/14 Full Associate Assistant Lecturer Rank as of 7/1/14 is a required field! *Which best describes the project New research objectives with a new community partner New research objectives with an existing community partner Continued research objectives with an existing community partner Which best describes the project is a required field! *Project Title: Project Title: is a required field! *Project Abstract (75 words or less) Project Abstract (75 words or less) is a required field! *Narrative (500 words or less) Narrative (500 words or less) is a required field! *How does the project contribute to the public good?
