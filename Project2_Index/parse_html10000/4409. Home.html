CSUSM WASC History In the most recent cycle, CSUSM completed the Educational Effectiveness Review in April 2009. As a result, the WASC Commission reaffirmed the university's accreditation for seven years. An interim report was submitted to WASC in Fall 2012. In this report progress made in academic master planning, strengthening academic programs through assessment of student learning and improving retention of first year students and graduation rates were described.
