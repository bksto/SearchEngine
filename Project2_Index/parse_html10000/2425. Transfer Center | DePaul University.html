Application and Admission Traditional transfer students are students under age 24 who attended another college or university prior to applying to DePaul and are in good standing at their most recent institution. How do I apply? We outline each step on the transfer admission process page. Can I get into DePaul? The admission requirements for transfer applicants are based on the college you are applying to. Students must meet these cumulative grade point average minimums for consideration. ​​Admission by College/S​​chool Guidelines College of Communication College of Computing and Digital Media College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences College of Science and Health *The Theatre School (an audition or portfolio review, and an interview are required) ​ ​Minimum of 2.0 GPA Driehaus College of Business College of Education *School of Music (audition is also required) ​ ​Minimum of 2.5 GPA Cumulative GPA is calculated by combining GPA’s from every regionally accredited college or university a student has attended. *Require audition, portfolio review and/or interview. Do I need to send all of my transcripts? Yes, we need official transcripts from every college or university you have attended. We cannot accept unofficial transcripts to complete your application. When should I apply? You can start applying to transfer to DePaul with one term in progress at another institution. Once you begin your last term at your current school, you should start the transfer application process. Transfer applications are accepted for all four quarters of the academic year. Learn more about deadlines. How long does it take to get an admission decision? We review transfer applications on a rolling basis. Most applicants will have an admission decision within two to four weeks of their application being completed. We also offer instant admission decision through our Accelerated Transfer Admission program. Register to attend an admission event. Who is my transfer counselor? Visit our Counselor Finder map to find your transfer admission representative. If you attend a school that’s not listed, call our office at (312) 362-8300 to speak with an admission counselor. Can I meet with a counselor on my current campus? DePaul representatives visit Chicago-area community colleges regularly throughout the year. Visit our Counselor Finder map for information on visits to your campus. If you attend a school not listed on our Counselor Finder map, we invite you to contact our office to schedule an appointment. Preparation DePaul accepts transfer credit from a variety of two- and four-year colleges. Use our online tools to select future courses and see how courses you’ve already completed will transfer to DePaul. If I spend two years at a community college, how should I plan? Use the Transfer Guides for guidance on how to transfer from more than 20 Illinois community colleges. Transferology™ (formerly u.select) will give you quick answers on how your college credits will transfer to DePaul. Set up an account, add your coursework and get your results immediately. And participate in the DePaul Admission Partnership Program (DAPP). The program was created for students who choose to begin their bachelor’s degree at a community college. You’ll meet regularly with DePaul transfer admission counselors and attend special events for transfer students. You will map out your entire degree plan — so you’ll still be on the right track each step of the way. Do I need to take specific classes before transferring? There are no specific courses that you need to take to be eligible to transfer, but we can recommend courses to take for particular majors. A list of courses for community college students can be found in our Transfer Guides. How can I take courses I know will transfer? You can use both the Transfer Guides and Transfer Course Lists database to help select courses that will transfer to DePaul. Transferology™ (formerly u.select) will give you quick answers on how your college credits will transfer to DePaul. Set up an account, add your coursework and get your results immediately. Transfer Course Lists aren’t comprehensive and show only those courses that we've previously seen transferred to DePaul. To find out if other courses will transfer, email trac@depaul.edu with the name of your school and course information and we’ll look into it. What's the difference between quarters and semesters? Instead of a 16-week semester, DePaul follows a 10-week quarter system. The fall quarter begins in September, winter in early January, spring in late March and summer in mid-June. Most students transferring to DePaul transfer semester credits. We will recalculate your semester credit hours into quarter hours by multiplying them by 1.5. Read more about the quarter system from a student perspective on DeBlogs. Can I sit down with somebody to help select my classes? Yes! Schedule an individual admission counseling appointment to discuss your academic plans, review previous coursework and transfer credits at length. Schedule an appointment online. Financial Aid Nearly 78 percent of undergraduates receive some form of assistance through need-based financial aid and merit-based scholarships. Financial aid includes grants, federal loans and federal work-study programs. In 2013-2014, DePaul awarded more than $288 million in financial aid and assistance. How does financial aid work at DePaul? The Office of Financial Aid at DePaul will serve as your primary guide and resource for financing your education. Visit our Financial Aid section for more information on types of aid and managing the costs of attending college. When should I apply for financial aid? You should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as soon as possible. You do not have to wait for an admission decision in order to begin the financial aid application process. (The FAFSA for the coming academic year is available on January 1 of each year.) Learn more. What scholarships are available? Transfer students are automatically considered for merit scholarships at the time of admission to the university. Select “Transfer Students” on our scholarships page for more information. I’m a veteran. What do I need to do to take advantage of using my benefits?
