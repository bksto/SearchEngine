That engagement starts in the First Year with the WPI Insight Program and Great Problems Seminar. Through the Insight Program, you’ll have a team of professionals focused on your success—a faculty advisor, a community advisor, and resident hall advisor, each working together to answer your questions and provide the guidance and support you need to make the most of your first year at WPI. The Great Problems Seminar is an opportunity to jump start your WPI project experience. You’ll work in teams focused on themes of global importance. Whether you want to heal, power, educate, or feed the world, you will find a project that inspires you to learn more. First Year Students Focus on Solving the World's Great Problems Through the Great Problems Seminars, small teams of first year students and faculty step outside their disciplines to solve problems in the areas of food, energy, health, and engineering for sustainability. It's an invigorating immersion into university-level research and the project-based curriculum at WPI.
