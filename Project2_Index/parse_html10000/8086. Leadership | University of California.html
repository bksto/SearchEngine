Designed to protect the university from shifting political winds, UC's constitutionally granted independence lets leadership put the health of UC first. Board of Regents The University of California is governed by the 26-member Board of Regents, which exercises approval over university policies, financial affairs, tuition and fees. The board appoints the university president and its principal officers. Eighteen regents, appointed by the governor, serve 12-year terms. Seven serve as ex officio members, including the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the assembly and state superintendent of public instruction. The board also appoints a student regent to a one-year term. In addition, two staff advisors serve two-year terms as non-voting advisors to three Regents' Committees.

The senate also advises the administration on faculty appointments, promotions and budgets.
