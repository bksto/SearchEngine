Pre-Participation Medical Clearance The following is a description of each form needed for an athlete to be cleared for varsity sports at WPI.  Please use this printable guide to complete your paperwork on myWPI. The myWPI website can be accessed through this link. 1. "Confidential Medical History Form and Preparticipation Physical" (REQUIRED) This questionnaire provides us with relevant information about the student-athlete's medical history in regards to sports. The “Pre-Participation Physical” needs to be performed by a Board Certified Physician. Student-athletes who are beginning their initial season of eligibility (first years or transfers) are required to undergo this medical examination within a six month period prior to their sport's start date. (Sport start dates are listed below) Please be sure to submit a copy of BOTH forms to the athletic training staff. PLEASE BE AWARE: Physical forms from doctor's offices may or may not have all the appropriate testing performed. It is advised that the WPI "pre-participation physical" form be used to avoid conflict. The physician signature and office stamp ensure that your son/daughter was seen and cleared by the appropriate medical personnel. Please be sure that the doctor completes the forms in full.   2. "Acceptance of risk and consent to treat" (REQUIRED) This form alerts athletes to the dangers of sports participation and allows the sports medicine team to provide treatment to the athlete. 3."Sickle Cell Trait Requirement form & waiver" (REQUIRED) The NCAA requires that all student-athletes have knowledge of their sickle cell trait status before participation in any intercollegiate athletics event, including but not limited to, strength and conditioning sessions, practices, and competitions. Sickle Cell Screening: Option 1: Have your primary care physician look up your sickle cell trait status and then have them document your status on the Sickle Cell Trait Requirement form. Sickle cell trait status is tested at birth and should have been noted in the student-athlete’s medical records. Option 2: If sickle cell trait status was not tested at birth, or is not documented in the student-athlete’s medical records, sickle cell trait testing in the form of a sickle cell screen blood test should be done by the student-athlete’s primary care physician before coming to campus. If testing is not performed at home, the student-athlete can request testing at WPI Health Services. Option 3: If the student-athlete and his/her parent/guardian do not desire sickle cell testing, a waiver must be signed by both the student-athlete and the parent/guardian and the student-athlete must engage in mandatory education (30 minute video) regarding sickle cell. 4. "Insurance Acknowledgement Requirement Form" (REQUIRED) This form verifies that WPI students participating in intercollegiate athletics have the appropriate amount of medical coverage mandated by the NCAA ($90,000). This document must be signed by the parent or guardian who is the insurance card holder. Please maintain the first page for your records and return the signed second page with the other forms. 5. "Pre-Participation Videos and Quizzes"  Please click on this link for directions on how to login and watch the required videos. These are educational videos regarding concussion, MRSA, and Sickle Cell trait. Watching the concussion and MRSA educational videos are mandatory for all athletes. Athletes who opt to use the Sickle Cell Waiver must watch the video and complete the quiz. 6. Front and back photocopy of the Athlete's health insurance card (REQUIRED) 7. "ADD/ADHD Medication exception form" (Submitted As Needed) This form is only needed if the student-athlete is prescribed medication to treat ADD/ADHD. Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and can persist through adolescence and into adulthood. ADHD is generally diagnosed in childhood, but sometimes not until college or later. The most common medications used to treat ADHD are methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine (Adderall), which are banned under the NCAA class of stimulants. In order for a medical exception to be granted for the use of these stimulant medications, the student-athlete must show that he or she has undergone standard assessment to identify ADHD. If they do not undergo a standard assessment to diagnose ADHD, they have not met the requirements for an NCAA medical exception. Most colleges provide these types of assessment through their student support services or counseling and testing centers. The student-athlete should either provide documentation of an earlier assessment, or undergo an assessment prior to using stimulant medication for ADHD. If the diagnosis is ADHD, the student-athlete may then pursue treatment with the team physician or family physician for a prescription for stimulant medication, and provide all documentation to the appropriate athletics administrator to keep in the file in the event the student-athlete is selected for drug testing and tests positive. At that point, the athletics administrator will be instructed to provide the documentation for review by the medical panel, and if all is in order, the student-athlete’s medical exception is granted. Further explaination can be found here. 8. NCAA HIPAA Release This form is needed for your compliance paperwork. It will authorize athletic training to release information about injuries to the NCAA in an anonymous manner to help evaluate effectiveness of health and safety rules and policies.   Deadlines for Preparticipation Clearance 2014: Fall Sports: Football: August 13th, physicals accepted from February 13th on                  Men's Soccer: August 16th, physicals accepted from February 16th on                                            Volleyball: August 15th, physicals accepted from February 15th on                   Field Hockey: August 14th, physicals accepted from February 14th on                 Women's Soccer: August 16th, physicals accepted from February 16th on                                        Cross Country: August 26th, physicals accepted from February 26th on                    ALL OTHER SPORTS: August 28th, physicals accepted from February 28th on                         THE EARLIER THE BETTER The forms above and in the preceding links are in PDF format, for use with Adobe Acrobat Reader®.
