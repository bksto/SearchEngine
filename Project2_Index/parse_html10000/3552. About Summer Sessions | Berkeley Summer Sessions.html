What type of student are you?     Summer Sessions offers more than 600 courses each summer, in a wide variety of disciplines. Courses are offered over five different sessions of varying lengths—the first session usually begins towards the end of May, and all sessions have ended by mid-August. More than 16,000 students attend UC Berkeley in the summer, and nearly 4,000 of those students are visitors (non-UC Berkeley students). Several special programs are available to summer students, including programs for incoming freshmen and transfer students, summer study abroad and international and domestic internships, and a pre-collegiate program for high school students. Enrollment in courses and applications for programs opens in February.   Our Mission Statement: UC Berkeley Summer Sessions is committed to offering high quality, innovative academic courses and experiential education opportunities during the summer. By opening our doors to visiting students and continuing our service to UC Berkeley students, we support the University’s goals of educating a broad and diverse student population. Our commitment to providing superior service and unrivaled learning opportunities extends to our students, campus units and departments, and all external partners.   © UC Berkeley Summer Sessions, 1995 University Avenue 510-642-5611 SSALL Contact Donate to BSS
