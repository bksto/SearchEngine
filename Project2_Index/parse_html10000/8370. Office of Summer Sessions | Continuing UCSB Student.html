During the summer we provide 600+ courses to 8,000 students. As a continuing student there are numerous options for you:   Consider taking an online course. Travel to London or Italy with our summer travel study program. Take our Film Studies 119 course and check out the Telluride Film Festival, or one of our other special courses.   To enroll in courses: 1. Log into GOLD. 2. Select 'Registration Info.' 3. Choose Summer 2015. You will be able to open your summer quarter and enroll in summer courses according to your pass time.   *You are considered a continuing student if you were enrolled in courses in the Spring Quarter. This includes EAP students.   **Students who have declared degree candidacy for the Spring quarter are no longer considered UCSB students for the Summer term. You may un-declare your Spring degree candidacy and re-declare for the Summer term to be considered a UCSB student. Doing so does not stop you from participating in Spring Commencement.
