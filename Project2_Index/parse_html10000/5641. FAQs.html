All applications are due November 30. Learn more about how to apply to UC Riverside. Where do I apply? You may apply to UC Riverside using the University of California’s online application system. For more detailed directions, see our Apply Now page. How much will my application cost? The application fee is $70 for each UC campus to which you apply. For international applicants, the fee is $80 for each campus. Fee waivers are available for up to four campuses for eligible United States citizens and permanent residents. You can apply for a fee waiver within the online application and will be notified immediately whether or not you have qualified. What is the personal statement? The personal statement is your chance to tell us about yourself within your UC application. You will receive two essay prompts. Responses to both prompts must be a maximum of 1,000 words total. That means you can choose to respond to one prompt at greater length; however, we suggest that your shorter answer be at least 250 words. Learn more about the personal statement, get tips on writing it and see the prompts here. What about test scores? Incoming freshmen must take the ACT Plus Writing or the SAT Reasoning Test no later than December of their senior year. For ACT, SAT, AP, and IB scores, you will need to order score reports from the appropriate testing agency. We can only accept score reports from the testing agency – you can't email or fax them to our offices. Transfer students will be notified on MyUCR if any test score reports are required. For the ACT Plus Writing and SAT Reasoning Test, we will focus on the highest total score from a single test date (or single sitting). We do not require SAT Subject Tests, but some academic departments and competitive majors do recommend them. We recommend that students interested in the Bourns College of Engineering or the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences take the Math 2 Subject Test and either Chemistry or Physics. How will I know if I have been admitted? After you receive notification that we have received your application, you should set up a MyUCR account at My.UCR.edu and link it to your application. Admission decisions will be posted on MyUCR starting mid-January for freshmen and March 1 for transfers. Check your MyUCR account frequently to ensure that you respond immediately to any alerts and/or document requests from your admissions counselor. Freshman Admission I’m a freshman.
