University employees are expected to be honest and conduct themselves in ways that accord respect to themselves and others. University employees are expected to accept full responsibility for their actions and to strive to serve others and accord fair and just treatment to all. University employees are expected to conduct themselves in ways that foster forthright expression of opinion and tolerance for the view of others. As many of you know, the workplace bullying survey was designed and administered by a grass-roots Campus Coalition Against Workplace Bullying that included representatives of AFSCME, GEO, MSP, PSU, USA/MTA, the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity, the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program, the Labor/Management Workplace Education program, the Ombuds Office, and the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences.   Building on the work of that group, a Committee on Workplace Climate and Bullying, which includes representatives of those organizations and offices, as well as several campus administrators and is chaired by a representative of my office, has been working for the past year on how best to address the serious problem that has been identified. On the recommendation of that committee, the campus will begin in the fall of this year a comprehensive educational campaign aimed at increasing understanding of the problem of workplace bullying, minimizing its occurrence, and clarifying the responsibility of supervisors for ensuring a productive workplace in which all can contribute to their maximum potential.  This effort will kick off with a one-day symposium organized by the Committee and jointly sponsored by the participating unions and the campus administration.  Additionally, there will be a series of workshops on the topic of workplace bullying for all faculty members and staff.  Details about both of these activities will be forthcoming. In the meantime, I hope all members of the campus community will consider carefully the ways in which we interact with fellow faculty and staff members and will ensure that those interactions are characterized by mutual respect and civility.  If you have any specific suggestions, I encourage you to contact any of the members of the Committee, who are listed below.
