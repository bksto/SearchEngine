Pennovation Works will be anchored by the Pennovation Center, a new business incubator and accelerator that will provide lab space and a hub for collaboration, creativity and the exchange of ideas for innovators from all disciplines. Construction is underway for the Pennovation Center and completion is anticipated in Summer 2016.   FMC Tower at Cira Centre South Construction has begun on the FMC Tower at 30th and Walnut Streets – the final phase in the collaborative redevelopment of U.S. Postal Service Facilities by Penn, Brandywine Realty Trust and FMC Corporation. It will serve as a dramatic model of pioneering urban development in Philadelphia and as a gateway to the dynamic educational, healthcare and entrepreneurial institutions in University City.   ARCH Spring 2014 marked the completion of the $24.5 million renovation of Penn's Arts, Research and Culture House (ARCH), the late-Gothic Revival building located at 36th Street and Locust Walk, which includes a new cafÃ©, lounges, study spaces and a high-tech multi-use auditorium/classroom.
