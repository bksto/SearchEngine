Some services include travel signatures, career practical training (CPT), SEVIS transfers, optional practical training (OPT) and much more. The ISS also coordinates cultural and social events that allow our students to share their national heritage and get involved with the campus educational community. Additionally, the center provides information for on- and off-campus resources. NEWS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS   International Registration Hold Get your international registration hold removed before your registration appointment begins. Email your proof of insurance to iss@csudh.edu for review. Include your first name, last name and CSUDH ID number in the subject line of the email. This is the only way you may submit your proof of health insurance. If you are not able to scan and email it to the email address, please contact the ISS Coordinator. For privacy reasons, please note that students are responsible for emailing their proof of health insurance to ISS. We will not accept emails from any off-campus insurance companies so make sure that you are emailing us the proof of insurance from your email account. New Automated Form I-94 (Arrival/Departure-Record) Process Effective April 30, 2013, for travel via air and sea, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) will no longer issue paper versions of the Form I-94 upon your entry to the U.S. Instead, the Port of Entry Officer will place an admission stamp in your passport marked with the visa status (F-1, J-1, etc.) and the letters "D/S" to indicate you have properly entered the U.S. Your arrival and departure information will be recorded electronically in the CBP's database. If you are traveling by land, you will be issued a paper Form I-94. International students may access their electronic Form I-94 online within approximately 24 hours of their arrival to the United States. All students should keep a printed Form I-94 with their passport in case they apply for future benefits such as work authorizations, social security numbers or driver's licenses. For more information about the new Form I-94 process, please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol website. Immigration Reminders   Full Time Enrollment As an F-1 visa holder, you are expected to enroll FULL TIME each fall and spring semester. •         Full time enrollment for undergraduates is 12 units. •         Full time enrollment for graduate students is 8 units.  Part Time Requests If you plan on taking less than a full course load for the fall 2014 semester, you must submit a part time form to the ISS office no later than Sept. 5, 2014. Part time forms are available for pick up in the ISS office. Please be sure to schedule an appointment prior to coming in.  Online Units International students on the F-1 visa are limited to enrolling on only ONE (3 units) online course per semester. If you are enrolled in more than one online class this semester, please come see me at the ISS office this week so that we can review your immigration status. Note: If you only have one class left to take to graduate, that class must be taken as an in-class, traditional course to be in compliance with legal guidelines governing your F-1 status. Add / Drop Deadline The LAST day to be able to add / drop classes this fall 2014 semester is September 11, 2014. On-Campus Employment F1 students are authorized to work on campus for up to 20 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters, and full time during summer and winter vacations. Please meet with the ISS Coordinator for more details regarding this.  Personal and Emergency Contact Information To be in compliance with U.S. Immigration Regulations, it is extremely important that the university has current contact information for all international students AT ALL TIMES. Failure to update your personal information with the university will put your immigration status in jeopardy.
