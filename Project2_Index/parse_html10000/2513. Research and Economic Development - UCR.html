One huge advantage of attending a research university is that you have the opportunity to work directly with faculty members in their research, scholarship and creative activities. Make sure you include this experience in your undergraduate program! Meaningful research, scholarship or creative activity, under faculty mentorship, is an integral part of your undergraduate education. It broadens your appreciation for your discipline and gives you a taste of graduate school. Undergraduate Education and the Colleges support a variety of programs that allow UCR students to attain a high proficiency in undergraduate research, scholarship and creative activity. Programs match students with faculty mentors, host several l symposia to showcase students' accomplishments, and help to publish an Undergraduate Research Journal containing the highest quality research and scholarly activity completed on campus each year. Please take advantage of these opportunities.
