We’re focused on that investment, but we also understand that it can feel out of reach for many students, so we try to make it as affordable as possible. Our goal as an institution is to manage our resources as effectively as possible, so we can pass a better value along to our students. For the second year in a row, the tuition increase for continuing undergraduate students is 2.5 percent, which is the same as the rate of inflation. The recent tuition increase for incoming freshman is 5.5 percent, a rate that is on par or lower than that of peer institutions. Rates for graduate students vary, depending on the program of study. We also offer a full range of financial aid opportunities to ensure access to a diverse population of students. In 2013-2014, DePaul awarded more than $288 million in financial aid and assistance.
