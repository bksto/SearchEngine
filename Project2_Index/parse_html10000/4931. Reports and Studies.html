Later in the fall of 2013, President Hagan convened a group of faculty whose job was to read and reach understanding about key elements of the literature on student success, and to write a report focused on the success of our students. The group was chaired by Dr. John Keyantash. Dr. Munashee Furusa also offered leadership and support through his dean’s office. Members of our campus community are encouraged to access and read both reports.

Dr. Hagan has asked the task force to provide appropriate interim reports to the campus community.   The five Preliminary Internationalization Reports posted are the fruit of the task force work in 2013-14, which pursued an ACE-recommended Internationalization Review to build the foundation for a proper plan, using an ACE-supplied tool, Questions to Guide the Internationalization Review.  The campus community is encouraged to read the preliminary reports and to provide feedback. Task Force co-chairs, Dr. Janine Gasco and Dr. Keith Boyum, will welcome any comments.
