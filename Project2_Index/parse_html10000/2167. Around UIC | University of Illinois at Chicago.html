UIC is situated right in the heart of many culturally rich neighborhoods, including Greektown, Pilsen, Little Italy, Chinatown and more. The West Loop area of Chicago is also very close to UIC, and is a popular choice for many UIC students who live off campus. In a city the size of Chicago, there is a multitude of neighborhoods to choose from. And thanks to the CTA bus and el lines, most of these neighborhoods are mere minutes away from UIC. UIC is close to a number of popular Chicago neighborhoods: Greektown, just north of UIC, is home to a number of popular Greek restaurants, bakeries and mini-marts. Pilsen, located south of UIC, is known for its large Latino community. This area features a number of authentic Mexican restaurants. University Village, south of UIC along Halsted, was recently revamped into a trendy, college student-oriented area. Little Italy, largely located along Taylor Street, features fast food restaurants. If you're looking for fine dining, bars and nightclubs, simply head west of Racine. Chinatown is located south of downtown, and is easily accessible via the Red Line train. It is home to about 50 restaurants covering regional cuisines from Shanghai, Cantonese, to Hunan and Sichuan. For more information, visit the Off-Campus Housing website.
