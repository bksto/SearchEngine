Join CSUSM students to recognize César Chávez, a Mexican American farm worker, labor leader, and civil rights activist. César Chávez is considered a hero for farm laborers and is hailed as one of the greatest American civil rights leaders. To honor César Chávez’s life and work, the Office of Civic Engagement and Student Life & Leadership are organizing the annual César Chávez Day of Service. This event includes service in our community followed by lunch and reflection. Stay tuned for details. Alternative Spring Break Alternative Spring Break (offered through ASI) is where CSUSM students volunteer their week of Spring Break to work with a community service agency. During this week students travel to a location outside of San Diego County and help with various duties where needed. These students also take part in numerous activities to explore the area in which they are visiting. Student Organizations CSUSM is home to over 100 student organizations and many have a focus on performing community service. Fraternity & Sorority Life One of the pillars of Greek life at CSUSM is a commitment to the service of others and community impact.
