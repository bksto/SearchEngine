Bauer students interested in being considered for these financial need-based scholarships must complete one of the following forms (in addition to the Bauer Scholarship Application) in order to establish financial need. U.S. citizens and permanent residents should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.ed.gov International students should complete the Bauer Financial Aid Application for International Students. This form and its supporting documentation will be turned in to the Bauer Scholarship Office for evaluation. This form is similar to the International TPEG application. If you would like to be considered for the TPEG, you will need to apply with the International Student Service and Scholars Office at www.issso.uh.edu/finances/tpegisssoscholarship.html This application and the supporting documentation will then be turned in to ISSSO. Applications turned in to Bauer will not be considered for the TPEG. Links for these forms are included on the scholarship application. If you link to these sites from the application, click BACK to return to the application and continue completing the form. It is very important to remember that the Bauer Scholarship Application must be completed in order to be considered for Bauer scholarships. In addition, scholarships that require financial need will only be offered to those students who have also completed the appropriate form above. During the 2012-2013 academic year, over 500 Bauer College of Business students were awarded more than $1,344,000 in Bauer scholarships. Awards range from $1,000 to $5,000. Scholarships are awarded to students in every major and every classification and are usually awarded based on merit or financial need, or a combination of both. Scholarships go to all kinds of students - even students like you. You can review some of the scholarships and their criteria by clicking on Available Scholarships. But remember, you only have to complete the one application and you will automatically be considered for every scholarship for which you qualify. Selection Process The Bauer College Scholarship Committee selects scholarship recipients through a competitive process. Many of the Bauer College Scholarships have specific requirements in addition to merit and/or financial need, such as major or field of interest, community involvement, career goals, leadership skills, or membership in Bauer College student organizations. The specific criteria for each scholarship are established by the scholarship donor and the College. Most Bauer scholarships are awarded over the summer for the upcoming academic year but the Committee continues to award scholarships throughout the year as long as there are funds available or new scholarships established. Awards are usually disbursed in two installments, half in the Fall semester and half in the Spring, and are applied directly to the recipient's student account. All scholarship recipients have one thing in common: They all took the time to apply. Shouldn't you? Can I Apply? To be eligible for the Bauer College Scholarships, students must be admitted to the University of Houston (Main Campus) and the Bauer College of Business. Please note that students who are admitted to the University of Houston but are not admitted to the Bauer College of Business are not eligible for the Bauer College Scholarships. If you believe that you will be admitted before scholarship decisions are made or before the Fall semester begins, you may complete the online application but you can not be awarded a Bauer scholarship without admittance. Every Bauer College student is encouraged to apply. Current business majors, as well as incoming graduate students and Bauer College freshmen, transfer students, and international students are eligible to apply for Bauer College Scholarships.
