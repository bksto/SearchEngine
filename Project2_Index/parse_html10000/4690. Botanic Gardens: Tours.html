School groups can learn much from organized tours of the Gardens. Here is the "who, what and where" of guided school tours. Who Any group from 10 to 60 persons (or two classes), 3rd grade to adult, may schedule a tour. Include one adult for every 10 students under 18 years of age. For groups of 2nd grade and below, and groups of less than 10 people, see our self-guided tour publications found below. All groups of more than ten people must schedule their visit in advance. For people with mobility limitations, ask about tours of the Wheelchair Pathway. What Docent guided school tours center around the California State Teaching Curriculum -based UCRBG "Discovery Stop Summary" booklet with adjustments for age of the group and interest. Included is general information about the Gardens, desert adaptations of plants, uses of local plants by Native Americans, the state tree and flower, herbs, and more. Where Tour groups are met at the Gardens entrance at the scheduled time. If you arrive early, use the opportunity to peruse information pamphlets, get a drink of water and use the restrooms (the next restrooms are 20 to 30 minutes along the tour!). Most buses can turn around and drop off students near the entrance and park in the Gardens' parking lot where they don't block traffic; buses may also leave campus and return to pick up the students at an appointed time. When Guided tours are best scheduled at least one month in advance. Docents are available 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 3 p.m. Tuesday to Friday. Tours last about an hour, depending on interest and questions. There is a 15 minute leeway for arrival -- if your group is 15 minutes late, the guided tour is canceled -- so allow plenty of time for loading and traffic. Some classes like to bring a sack lunch to eat on the lawn area after the tour. Tours are scheduled on a first come/first served basis. How Schedule a School Tour Cost Tours are free, though donations are always welcome. A donation box is located at the entrance Gatehouse. For Teachers: How guided tours at UCRBG fit into the California State teaching curriculum We have revised our docent-led tours to integrate more closely with the state science and social studies curriculum.

For Fifth Grade Social Studies Curriculum See plants that were essential to the survival of Colonial settlers See non-native plants brought to America by colonists and learn how they have impacted human survival and the ecology of the land Discover our Herb Garden, an excellent example of one that early colonists would have known Science Curriculum See how plant structures are differentiated for transpiration, photosynthesis and material transport For Sixth Grade Social Studies Curriculum Understand climate and physical environment of the ancient Near, Middle, and Far East Identify plants from these regions, including camellia, papyrus and ginkgo Science Curriculum See examples of photosynthesis and the interdependence of plants in an ecosystem We look forward to welcoming you to a wonderful outdoor classroom experience.
