Students' demands to have library open 24 hours. The library reinstated its 24-hour schedule in Fall 2005, but with stricter security guidelines in place. A comprehensive security assessment of the Young Library area was completed in summer 2004 and recommended limiting the library to electronic access from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. (i.e., having students use student IDs to gain entrance to the library). The library implemented a suitable alternative since badge access was not feasible. Access was restricted to: Current UK students, faculty, staff and reciprocal college borrowers (see list below). IDs would be checked manually. Restricted access period was shortened to 10:00 p.m. through 6:00 a.m. This restricted access period corresponds to the same restricted access period employed by the Medical Center. Restricting access is common practice in libraries with extended hours. Requiring an ID to enter the building overnight is a security measure and is enforced for the safety and security of every student, staff, and faculty member in the library after 10:00 p.m. Alternatives such as having student records checked by name or address are neither practical nor safe, increasing the time one would wait to enter the building, creating congestion in the library foyer, and increasing the chances of someone giving a false address to gain entry. *Additional information for Federal Depository Users.   Reciprocal Colleges  Alice Lloyd College  Asbury University  Asbury Theological Seminary  Bellarmine University  Berea College  Brescia University  Campbellsville University  Centre College  Clear Creek Baptist Bible College  Eastern Kentucky University  Frontier Nursing University  Georgetown College  KCTCS  Kentucky Christian University  Kentucky State University  Kentucky Wesleyan College  Lexington Theological Seminary  Lindsey Wilson College  Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary  Midway College  Morehead State University  Murray State University  Northern Kentucky University  St. Catharine College  Southern Baptist Theological Seminary  Sullivan University  Thomas More College  Transylvania University  Union College  University of Louisville  University of Pikeville (UPike)  University of the Cumberlands  Western Kentucky University   Research Help Ask Us for Research Help How to do Research How to Find Books and More Librarian Consultation Request Course Related Course Guides Course Reserves (Instructors) Course Reserves (Search) Instruction Request Library Information About UK Libraries Borrowing Information Contact UK Libraries Floor Maps Libraries Directory Libraries Site Index Library Resources Book Purchase Request Employment Opportunities Mobile Site Room Reservations UK Libraries Social Media Copyright 2015 UK Libraries.
