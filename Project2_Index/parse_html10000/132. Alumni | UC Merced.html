The UC Merced Alumni Association helps alumni stay connected to one another through social events on and off campus each year, such as homecoming, reunions and regional chapter gatherings. Alumni are also encouraged to attend other campus events, including lectures, concerts, fundraisers and athletic competitions. Whether it’s career services or information about graduate studies, there are resources and tools available for future endeavors. Be sure to keep your contact information up to date so you don’t miss out on important news and information. The association also helps alumni connect with students in many ways, such as the Alumni Advisors, Connecting Alumni to Students (CATS) and much more. However you’d like to stay involved with the university after graduation, Alumni Relations is there to assist you.   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
