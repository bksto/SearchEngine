The campus began with a gift of land from Stephen Salisbury, a prosperous Worcester businessman who chaired WPI's first board of trustees. His family home, Salisbury Mansion, is located near campus. The campus was laid out by landscape architect Calvert Vaux, who designed New York's Central Park. WPI's first two buildings, Boynton Hall and the Washburn Shops, were completed in 1868. Today the campus comprises 36 major buildings, the most recent addition being the Sports and Recreation Center. In recent years, the university's reach has extended far beyond its home in Worcester. Some graduate programs are offered in Westborough, Mass., and the university has become the national leader in global technological higher education, sending students to sites around the world to complete professional-level projects.   About WPI Visit WPI Directions Campus Maps Campus Phone Numbers Parking Public Transportation Safety & Security Gateway Park Area Dining Area Lodging Worcester, WPI's Home City Interactive Tour WPI Difference Facts & Figures History & Traditions Awards & Accolades Mission & Goals Sustainability Accreditation for WPI & Programs Desktop Wallpaper Send a WPI E-Card WPI Website Related Sites Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science Students Parents Alumni Media Corporate Partners Give to WPI Worcester Polytechnic Institute 100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280 Ph: +1-508-831-5000 Contact Us | Directions Resources: Calendar Campus Maps Human Resources Copyright Directories Gordon Library myWPI Newsroom Offices & Services ~ Feedback & Questions ~
