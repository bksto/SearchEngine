You should prepare for admission to UC Davis by first ensuring that you meet UC admission requirements. Meeting these requirements does not guarantee admission to UC Davis—applicants who are admitted generally well exceed UC admission requirements. UC Davis reviews all applications using our specific selection criteria. For freshman applicants, the strength of the high school record is the single most important component, followed by performance on standardized test scores and other criteria, such as demonstrated leadership, special talent and individual initiative. For transfer applicants, academic performance and preparation for the selected college and major are considered first and foremost. In some cases, personal characteristics, experiences and circumstances will be considered.
