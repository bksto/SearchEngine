The film is a satire that follows the stories of four black students at an Ivy League college where a riot breaks out over a popular “African American” themed party thrown by white students. With tongue planted firmly in cheek, the film explores racial identity in “post-racial” America, while weaving a universal story of forging one’s unique path in the world. Click here for the trailer. Food will be served at the discussion. The film is hosted by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, Student Activities, the Humanities and Arts Department, and the ALANA Network.
