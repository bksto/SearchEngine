By 2020, the campus has pledged to consume zero net energy, and produce zero waste and zero net greenhouse gas emissions. This Triple Zero plan includes enhancement of its 1 megawatt solar array, which supplies about 20 percent of the campus’s power now. Rooftop solar systems being installed in 2014 on up to 11 main campus buildings will further reduce its environmental footprint and generate another megawatt. Across campus, even in labs, classrooms and offices, you’ll see UC Merced’s dedication recycling and composting to reduce the amount of waste going in to landfills. Landscaping, smart energy use, transportation systems and more all contribute to reaching the goal of zero net greenhouse gas emissions – and more policies, procedures and initiatives are coming online all the time to make this campus as green as it can possibly be. The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service. University of California, Merced 5200 N.
