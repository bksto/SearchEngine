This interdisciplinary structure allows UC CEIN to (a) create a library of nanomaterials; (b) understand the effects of nanomaterials on organisms and ecological systems; (c) characterize the mobility, persistence, and reactivity of nanomaterials in the environment; (d) design a predictive model of toxicology and environmental impacts of nanomaterials; and (e) develop guidelines and decision tools for safe design and use of nanomaterials. Theme 1 Nanomaterial Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization for Standard Reference and Combinatorial Libraries Theme 2 Nanomaterial Interactions: From Molecular to Systemic Levels Theme 3 Organismal, Population, Community, and Ecosystem Toxicology Theme 4 Nanoparticle Fate and Transport. Theme 5 High-Throughput Screening, Data Mining, and QSARs for Nanomaterials Theme 6 Modeling of the Environmental Multimedia Nanomaterial Distribution and Toxicity Theme 7 Environmental Risk Perception Nanomaterial Synthesis and Physicochemical Characterization for Standard Reference and Combinatorial Libraries Theme 1 will synthesize and characterize a library of standard reference materials (SRMs), to be supplemented with commercially produced nanomaterials (e.g., carbonaceous, metal, oxide). The fully characterized SRM library will represent a broad range of nanomaterial compositions, structures, morphologies, reactivities, and interfacial properties that will in turn generate a combinatorial nanomaterial library. This combinatorial library will serve as the basis for mechanistic (Themes 2-4), high-throughput (Theme 5), and deterministic modeling (Themes 5 and 6) studies designed to probe the environmental fate and transport of these materials as well as their cellular, organism, and ecosystem toxicity.

Within the context of these webs, the mechanisms of nanomaterial uptake into cells, tissues, and organs will be explored; the toxicity paradigms used to screen for adverse environmental impacts of nanomaterials will be considered; and the additional energy required by a cell to compensate for toxic effects of nanomaterials (i.e., to fuel outward flowing systems needed) will be studied.

Schimel University of California, Santa Barbara Organismal, Population, Community, and Ecosystem Toxicology Building on the work of Themes 1 and 2, Theme 3 will examine the ecological effects of nanomaterials across three ecosystems (e.g., terrestrial plant-soil, freshwater streams, and marine benthos) and processes (e.g., colonization, turnover, trophic cascades, nutrient cycling). In multitrophic-level experiments, bioaccumulation and biomagnification of the nanomaterials will be assessed. Additionally, Theme 3 will explore how nanomaterial exposure influences energy uptake and utilization, and, subsequently, how effects at the molecular and cellular levels can be extrapolated to populations and communities.

Lenihan University of California, Santa Barbara Roger Nisbet University of California, Santa Barbara Joshua P. Schimel University of California, Santa Barbara Nanoparticle Fate and Transport Theme 4 will (a) explore the dominant pathways taken by different nanoparticles upon their release into different media (e.g., atmospheric, aquatic, terrestrial); (b) study how nanoparticle characteristics affect their fate in aquatic environments; (c) determine methods to quantify nanoparticle concentrations in the aquatic environment; and (d) determine how nanomaterials influence environmental chemistry. Theme 4 will also develop reproducible assays for high-throughput screening (Theme 5) in order to establish the relations between particle characteristics and primary fate and transport processes. Name Institution Erik M.V. Hoek University of California, Los Angeles Arturo A. Keller University of California, Santa Barbara Ponisseril Somasundaran Columbia University Sharon Walker University of California, Riverside High-Throughput Screening, Data Mining, and QSARs for Nanomaterials Theme 5 will perform high-throughput assays, working closely with Theme's 1-4, to determine the interfacial properties of nanomaterials that influence their fate, transport, and bioavailability as well as their toxicity. By using high-throughput methods, Theme 5 will be able to rapidly screen for nanomaterial toxicity in cell-based assays. Data mining will help Theme 5 identify patterns of toxic properties in tested nanomaterials. The quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) will be used to develop predictive models for risk assessment and safe design of nanomaterials. These two processes will inform the synthesis of specific nanomaterials to test toxicity paradigms (Theme 1) and the fate and transport modeling efforts (Theme 6). Name Institution Ken Bradley University of California, Los Angeles Robert Damoiseaux University of California, Los Angeles Erik M.V. Hoek University of California, Los Angeles Andre Nel University of California, Los Angeles Modeling the Environmental Distribution of Nanomaterials and their Potential Risk Theme 6 will integrate data provided by Theme's 1-5 into a database that will be available to researchers and industrial partners interested in mobility and toxicity assessment and estimation. In addition, IRG will develop a tiered multimedia model that will serve to: (a) evaluate the significance of nanomaterial transport and exposure pathways, (b) rank the potential impact of nanomaterials in the environmental media, and (c) guide nanomaterial research and regulatory activities for the safe design of nanomaterials.

Hoek University of California, Los Angeles Arturo A. Keller University of California, Santa Barbara Robert Rallo Universitat Rovira l Virgili Risk Perception of Potential Environmental Impacts of Nanotechnology Theme 7 will develop new tools for surveying the perceptions of the risks to the environment of nanomaterials and nano-enabled products. The group will study the concerns of both targeted special interest groups and the U.S. public. Analysis of governmental regulatory structures, standards, and policies will enable Theme 7 to determine whether governance structures and social variables either amplify or reduce perception of nanotechnology's environmental risk. Additionally, meta-analysis of the risk and risk communications literature for relevant new technologies (e.g., chemicals, energy) with seemingly analogous attributes to nanotechnology will be conducted. Knowledge obtained from the surveys and analyses will support Theme 7's work with science journalists in developing a socially sustainable, environmental risk communication with the public.
