The Stanford Parents' Program and the Parents' Club are among the organizations that give parents a chance to become more involved with the university. New Student Orientation New Student Orientation (NSO) is held in late September shortly before school begins. It includes events for parents, such as seminars, chances to meet university administrators and a dinner hosted by the provost. Wear comfortable clothing and shoes. Events involve much walking. Plus, although some residences have elevators, many do not. You may have to carry boxes of belongings up several flights of stairs. Temperatures are warm during the days--70s to 80s--and cool in the evenings--40s to 50s. All parent programming is scheduled for only the first day of NSO. After bidding farewell to their children in the late afternoon at residence hall events, most parents end their day at the annual Parent Dinner with the Provost. Information on orientation is included in Approaching Stanford. A schedule of NSO events is provided to parents and students when they arrive. Advance reservations for hotel rooms are strongly advised. If you have questions about NSO, call (650) 723-7674 or send email to approaching@stanford.edu.
