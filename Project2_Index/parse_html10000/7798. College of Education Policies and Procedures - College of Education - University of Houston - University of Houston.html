Nothing in the college’s policies and procedures changes the “at will status” of any employee, or creates any additional rights, remedies, at law, or expectations of continued employment. The College of Education reserves the right to change, modify, amend, or abandon any policy or procedures at any time. These college policies and procedures are applicable to all staff employees, including full-time, part-time, temporary, exempt, non-exempt, regular, and non-regular staff employees. A detailed Staff Handbook can be found on the UH Human Resources website which serves as an additional internal policy and procedures guide for managing the human resource functions of the college. These college policies and procedures do not replace the more detailed and comprehensive university manuals such as: The UH System Administrative Memoranda (SAM -  http://www.uh.edu/af/universityservices/policies/sam/index.htm) and The UH Manual of Administrative Policies and Procedures (MAPP - http://www.uh.edu/af/universityservices/policies/mapp/index.htm). In the event of any conflict between information in the college’s policy and procedures and information in the SAM and MAPP, the SAM or MAPP will control; however, the college’s policy and procedures may contain a greater degree of restrictions as needed to maintain fiscal responsibility, management, control and oversight of business and administrative processes to ensure high standards of ethical business practices.
