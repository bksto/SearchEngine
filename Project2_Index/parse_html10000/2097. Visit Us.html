Visit our campus where you can enjoy the beautiful Southern California weather on long palatial lawns or on shady benches beneath stands of eucalyptus and melaleuca "shedding bark" trees. Situated on the top of the highest hill for which the university is named, campus is surprisingly flat and offers a 360-degree view of the surrounding area with downtown Los Angeles to the northeast and the rolling hills of Palos Verdes and San Pedro harbor to the southwest. The additions of James L. Welch Hall, a score of new athletic facilities and the Home Depot Center sports complex have contributed to CSUDH’s move into the 21st century in stride.
