This form must be completed by all students (undergraduate and graduate) who are attending UCSB for the first time, returning to UCSB after a break in enrollment, or continuing UCSB students who wish to be considered for a change of classification from nonresident to California resident for a future term. Deadlines: A Statement of Legal Residence must be submitted by new undergraduate students no later than their SIR deadline as determined by the undergraduate admission office: May 1 for new freshman entering fall quarter, and June 1 for new fall transfer students. New graduate students should follow deadlines determined by the Graduate Division or individual academic departments. Instructions for continuing students seeking reclassification as California residents Continuing students (undergraduate and graduate) who are classified as nonresidents for tuition purposes and wish to be classified as California residents for a future term, must complete their SLR following the fourth week of the quarter immediately prior to the term for which classification as a resident is requested, and before the end of the quarter for which a change in classification is desired. Example: continuing nonresident students seeking a change of classification for fall quarter may file a new SLR following the fourth week of the previous spring quarter through the last day of the fall term. Estimated processing time for continuing students seeking reclassification is 30 days. Although students seeking reclassification may continue to file their SLR until the end of the term for which classification as a resident is requested, it is highly recommended that students submit their SLR no later than the end of the term immediately prior to the term for which classification as a resident is requested. This will assure that a final decision is made prior to fee payment deadlines and financial aid disbursements. Students who do not file at least 30 days in advance of their fee payment deadline will experience a significant processing delay (well beyond 30 days) that may delay financial aid disbursement and incur late payment fees. Students are responsible for on-time payment of all fees while a reclassification decision is pending. Students are encouraged to contact the BARC office regarding fee deferrals and other payment options well in advance of their fee payment deadline. Under no circumstances will documentation related to residency be accepted at the Santa Barbara campus beyond the end of the term for which classification as a resident is requested. Following submission of their SLR, students should monitor Gold at https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/gold/login.aspx (under Registration Information) for an update in their residence classification. Students who qualify for a resident classification will find their BARC accounts updated two working days after their classification is updated on Gold. Students who do not qualify for a resident classification under University policy will be notified by postal mail and given instructions to appeal. Information regarding University of California residence regulations for tuition purposes can be found at: Student Information. Please note that changes may be made in the residence requirements between the publication date of this statement and the relevant determination date. Although each campus may adopt different administrative procedures, University regulations regarding residency for tuition purposes are exactly the same for all UC campuses. Students attending or seeking to attend the Santa Barbara campus may consult with the campus Residence Deputy for more information.
