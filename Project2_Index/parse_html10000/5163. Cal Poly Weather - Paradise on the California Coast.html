Find out more about us: Points of Distinction Quick Facts Student Success Location Cal Poly - College in Paradise and the Weather to Prove It Expect sun. Cal Poly and San Luis Obispo have only have an average 50 days of rain per year - almost all of it between November and end of March. (It really does rain in California. Sometimes.) Central Coast residents revel in the area's Mediterranean climate. Summers are generally warm and sunny, with temperatures in the 70s and 80s. Winters are mild. Since campus is just 10 miles from the Pacific Ocean, everyday is a beautiful day in our neighborhood. Cal Poly is located halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, in an area known for the outdoors. Hiking, biking, kayaking, sailing, sport fishing, whale watching, rock climbing - it's all possible most of the year. Not to mention surfing. Surfline.com ranked Cal Poly as the No. 3 surf school in the nation. Cal Poly is just minutes from some of California's best beaches and original beach cities: Avila Beach (10 miles), Pismo Beach (12 miles), Morro Bay (17 miles), Montaña de Oro State Park (18 miles), Cayucos (18 miles), the Pismo Dunes (28 miles) and world-famous Hearst Castle ( 45 miles).

Both are key to Cal Poly's thriving Wine and Viticulture degree program.Just next door to the town and campus are three viticulture areas: the Edna Valley (6 miles), Arroyo Grande Valley (13 miles) and Avila Valley (7 miles). They are home to more than 20 wineries and 3,000 acres of vineyards. The Paso Robles wine region to the north (27 miles) is home to more than 26,000 vineyard acres and 180 wineries. Wine grape varieties range from Spanish to Italian, Bordeaux to Rhône, including the area's heritage variety: Zinfandel. Wine tasting and winery tours are part of the flavor of the Central Coast. You'll find wine events and festivals throughout the year - something to keep in mind when you're planning a visit.
