Live Pitch Information If you choose this category, you must deliver your pitch live at Create@STATE on April 10th. You will have up to 60 seconds to deliver the pitch. What is a Live Pitch?  You are simply providing a “teaser” to the audience with the purpose of having them ask "tell me more about your company": Product and service offering (e.g., the problem and your solution) Brief description of offering What problem or need does it solve? What are the benefits of your product? Unique Differentiators Why is this unique or different from competition? Is this difference sustainable (e.g., patents, intellectual property, etc.)? Market Opportunity & Target Customers Who are the targeted customers? What is the size of the market? Is there evidence they will buy the product? Current Development Stage What is the current status of technology/venture? o What are key next steps? Business Model – how will the company generate profitable revenue? Milestones and Success Metrics What are the success metrics? What is the exit strategy? Capital Needs How much funding is needed to move forward? How will the money be used? Why is your business an attractive investment? Common Live Pitch Mistakes No energy and passion in the presentation Too much technical language; focusing on the technology rather than the customer need Failure to explain what customer problem you are trying to solve Too much discussion about the idea and product and not enough explanation about the market, business opportunity, and revenue models Listing too many names of clients or partners. Indicate how many clients and name a few big names to spark interest  Helpful Links http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=elevator+pitch&ei=UTF-8&fr=moz35 Oral Presentation The author(s) of oral presentations are provided 10 minutes to present with five additional minutes allotted per presentation for questions. This schedule is strictly enforced by the room moderator. Oral presentations are held in technology enabled rooms. These rooms have a Dell laptop computer, projector and large screen. Each computer is configured with Windows 7 64 bit operating system and Microsoft Office 2010 including Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Presenters must use the laptop provided. Presenters must bring any digital presentation materials on a USB flash drive. It is strongly recommended that presenters bring a backup of their digital presentation materials on a secondary USB flash drive or provide handouts, in case their primary digital memory device does not work. The recommended format for presentations is Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 (.ppt), although files saved in older versions of PowerPoint should be compatible. All rooms have internet connectivity. If there are any technical difficulties during the presentation, please inform the moderator who will contact the technical support team. Presenters should arrive at their assigned room 10 minutes prior to the start of their session (not their individual talk) to transfer their presentation to the laptop and to ensure that it opens properly. Oral Presentation Judging Oral Presentations may be judged by A-State administration, faculty, and members of the community. The judges will consider the quality of information demonstrated by the presentation, creativity of the topic, the student's understanding of the topic evidenced by the presentation, and overall effective communication of the student's ideas. The author(s) must be able to discuss their topics during their assigned time during the session.  Professional Courtesy Create@STATE offers an opportunity for participants to observe, learn and practice professional etiquette common to all disciplines. Presenters should remain in the room until all presentations in their sessions are complete. The other presentations may offer new insights, and all presenters deserve the same audience and respect. Spectators to sessions should enter and exit the room between (not during) presentations.   Poster Presentation The author(s) of the poster must present the poster for judging on Thursday, April 10, 2014.
