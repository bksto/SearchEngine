A for-credit, academic internship is an approved and supervised work experience that meets specific student learning goals related to an academic field of study. This work-learning partnership between a student, the University and a community/industry partner supports a student's course of study and/or professional objectives, and on-site work or projects are combined with reflective academic assignments to help students learn by doing. For-credit internships (paid or unpaid) at CSUSM are designed to provide students opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills and gain valuable workplace experience. As well, the internship program offers industry partners the talents and energy of students and strengthens the link between the University and the business community. Information for: Community/Industry Partners CSUSM Students CSUSM Faculty * For non-credit, paid internship opportunities, please contact the CSUSM Career Center. For non-credit, unpaid internship opportunities, please contact the Office of Civic Engagement (Volunteerism). * If you are a non-profit and/or service organization, please contact the Office of Civic Engagement (Service Learning). While academic internships tend to focus solely on student learning, academic community service learning emphasizes the advantages to both the student and the recipient of the service activity (Furco 1996); thus both community needs and the student's learning needs are met.
