John Muir College, UCSD's second college, was named for famed environmentalist, nature writer, and Sierra Club founder John Muir. Established in 1967 when a new American environmental movement was taking shape under the influence of works such as Rachel Carson's bestselling book Silent Spring, Muir College continues to be inspired by its namesake's engagement with nature and human values. John Muir's self-directed and multifaceted career led the college to adopt as its motto "Celebrating the Independent Spirit." The college promotes awareness of environmental issues and is dedicated to the cause of sustainability. Since 1993, it has been home to UCSD's interdisciplinary Environmental Studies minor. In the spirit of John Muir, Muir College encourages the spirit of individual choice and responsibility within the framework of a strong, supportive community.
