Because this event attracts so many people, our advance registration program allows us to accurately plan for room size, food orders and so on. Parents should note that only those who register can attend Parents’ Weekend events, so definitely plan to register onsite at the Arrillaga Alumni Center, and it’s free!</p> <p>Parents should park at the Galvez Lot at the intersection of Galvez and Campus Drive, which is across the street from the Arrillaga Alumni Center. For directions, visit the <a href="https://parentsweekend.stanford.edu/getting-around">Getting Around website</a>.</p> <p><strong>Will I be able to get Internet access while on campus?</strong></p> <p>Parents are able to join the “Stanford Visitor” network for free access to the Internet while on campus. The Stanford Network offers limited bandwidth, and services include email and web browsing. For further information about the visitor network, please ask one of our registration volunteers upon check in.</p> <p><strong>What is Palo Alto-area weather like in February?</strong></p> <p>Generally speaking, the mornings and evenings can be quite cool—40-degree temperatures are common—and require a jacket or sweater. Once the fog burns off, mid-day temperatures can reach into the 70s. February is often rainy, and some of our long-range forecasts suggest that there may be showers that weekend. So we strongly recommend parents bring rain gear and umbrellas, just in case.</p> <p><strong>When and how can I pick up tickets for events?</strong></p> <p>Ticket distribution for all <a href="https://parentsweekend.stanford.edu/open-house-tours">open house tours</a> will start at 1 p.m. in front of the Arrillaga Alumni Center on Friday, Feb. 27, and will continue until all tickets are gone. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-served basis, and there will be a limit of two tickets per person.</p> <p>Regarding the <a href="https://parentsweekend.stanford.edu/entertainment-extravaganza">Entertainment Extravaganza</a> (EE), parents who purchased tickets online will find them in their registration packet upon check in.</p> <p>If there are any EE tickets remaining on Friday or Saturday, they can be purchased at either the registration desk at Arrillaga Alumni Center or at Memorial Auditorium. Also, since this event is expected to sell out, if you find that you are unable to use your EE tickets, we ask that you consider turning them into our ticket staff so that we can redistribute them to other parents who may like to attend this special closing event.</p> <p><strong>Can I bring another family member who is not a parent?</strong></p> <p>Yes. Everyone in the family is invited to Parents’ Weekend. If a member of your family needs disability-related accommodations, please let us know in advance by contacting the <a href="https://parentsweekend.stanford.edu/disability-information">Diversity and Access Office</a> by Feb. 13 at (650) 725-0326 or (650) 723-1216 TTY.</p> <p>For more answers to questions about Parents’ Weekend, visit the <a href="https://parentsweekend.stanford.edu/faq">FAQ website</a> or call 650-736-9018.</p> http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2015/02/05/five-things-to-know-about-parents-weekend/feed/ 0 NBC’s Richard Engel named graduation speaker http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2015/01/30/nbcs-richard-engel-named-graduation-speaker/ http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2015/01/30/nbcs-richard-engel-named-graduation-speaker/#comments Fri, 30 Jan 2015 22:30:45 +0000 kate Stanford Events http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/?p=1195 Richard Engel, the chief foreign correspondent for NBC News who has covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, will be the 2015 Commencement speaker at Stanford.

He has been the chief foreign correspondent for NBC News since 2008. As a Middle East correspondent, Engel was the only American television journalist to remain in Baghdad for the entire Iraq War, from the first shelling in 2003 to the capture and execution of Saddam Hussein. He was kidnapped while covering the Syrian civil war in December 2012 and was psychologically tortured by his captors before being freed, in a hail of gunfire between Syrian groups, after five days in captivity.</p> <p>&#8220;Richard Engel has worked tirelessly and courageously to translate the most important international issues of our time for the American public and the world,&#8221; said President John Hennessy. &#8220;From the beginnings of the war in Iraq to the Syrian civil war, to violence in Paris just this month, Richard has reported on conflict and risked his life to help all of us understand the historic implications. As a Stanford alumnus speaking to our new graduates, he can share firsthand what it means to be a truly global citizen.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I am overwhelmed to have been asked to speak this spring and return to the Farm,&#8221; Engel said. &#8220;I remember my own graduation nearly 20 years ago. When I walked into the stadium in the heat, I wasn&#8217;t sure what I would do next or where I would go. I had a plan, but doubts as well. A few weeks later, I decided to take a chance. I moved to the Middle East with a couple of suitcases, learned Arabic, began a career in journalism and never looked back. I look forward to talking to the graduates about what I&#8217;ve seen and learned over the years, exploring war zones, watching nations and societies smash into each other with tragic consequences. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to inspire some of these amazing young men and women to take a chance and stare fearlessly into the bright light outside the cave. I thank Stanford for this tremendous honor.&#8221;</p> <p>After graduating from Stanford in 1996 with a BA in international relations, Engel moved to the slums of Cairo to pursue work as a correspondent. He learned Arabic and worked as a freelancer for numerous news organizations from many Middle East locations. He worked as a freelance journalist for ABC News during the initial U.S. invasion of Iraq and continued his coverage of the war for NBC. He became Beirut bureau chief and senior Middle East correspondent in 2006. In 2009, Engel was stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan. In 2011, he reported on the Egyptian revolution amidst protests and tear gas. He covered the Libyan civil war, and did a segment on Mogadishu, Somalia, proclaiming it &#8220;the world&#8217;s most dangerous city.&#8221;</p> <p>Senior class presidents Connor Kelley, Malika Mehrotra, Eric Iwashita and Natalya Thakur said that the choice of Engel will provide the Class of 2015 with &#8220;an impassioned and tenacious speaker who will be able to inspire members of the Class of 2015 to engage with the world beyond whatever path our classmates choose after graduation.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Richard Engel has devoted his life and career to the pursuit of social justice through journalism, a commitment that demonstrates a high level of risk-taking in order to pursue his passion. We believe that he, as a Stanford alum, will be able to connect with students and share his perspective on the inspirational decisions and sacrifices he has made since leaving the Farm, and what it means to make an impact,&#8221; the class presidents said.</p> <p>Engel is the author of two books, <em>A Fist in the Hornet&#8217;s Nest</em> and <em>War Journal: My Five Years in Iraq</em>. Engel has won many awards for his work, including numerous Emmys, the George Foster Peabody Award (2009), the Edward R. Murrow Award (2006 and 2009) and the first Medill Medal for Courage in Journalism (2007). In 2011, Engel was honored with the Daniel Pearl Award for courage and integrity in journalism, in memory of Wall Street Journal reporter and Stanford alumnus Daniel Pearl, BA &#8217;85, who was kidnapped and murdered by terrorists in Pakistan in 2002.</p> <p>Baccalaureate speaker</p> <p>The Office for Religious Life will welcome Vernon E. Jordan Jr. to campus to give the Baccalaureate ceremony address. Jordan&#8217;s visit is timely: He was a leading figure in the civil rights movement and a former director of the United Negro College Fund who fought to abolish racial discrimination in college admission policies. He is a longstanding member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.</p> <p>&#8220;Vernon Jordan will speak to very relevant issues that have captured the interest of many people on campus, including our class members,&#8221; the class presidents said. &#8220;We hope that together, Mr. Jordan and Mr. Engel will offer a number of insights about taking risks, finding one&#8217;s own path in life and creating a unique place in the world.&#8221;</p> <p>Early in his career, Jordan worked for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was president of the National Urban League from 1971 to 1981. An attorney, Jordan served as a political adviser to his friend President Bill Clinton in the early 1990s. In 2006, Jordan became a member of the Iraq Study Group, advising on U.S. policy in Iraq. He is a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a member of the Bilderberg Group of American and European political leaders.</p> <p>Since 2000, Jordan has been senior managing director of Lazard Freres and Co. LLC, an investment banking firm. He has served on the boards of numerous corporations, including Revlon, Corning, Xerox and Nabisco, and has remained active in politics and social justice issues. A collection of his public speeches, Make It Plain: Standing Up and Speaking Out, was published in 2008. In 2001, Jordan was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP for lifetime achievement.</p> <p>Stanford&#8217;s 124th Commencement and Baccalaureate ceremonies are part of a celebration for graduates, their families and friends, and members of the Stanford community. The Baccalaureate ceremony will be held on the Main Quad on Saturday, June 13. Commencement will be held in the Stanford Stadium on Sunday, June 14.</p> http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2015/01/30/nbcs-richard-engel-named-graduation-speaker/feed/ 0 Stanford welcomes families to the Farm on Feb. 27 and 28 http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/12/02/stanford-welcomes-families-to-the-farm-on-feb-27-and-28/ http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/12/02/stanford-welcomes-families-to-the-farm-on-feb-27-and-28/#comments Tue, 02 Dec 2014 22:02:59 +0000 kate Stanford Events http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/?p=1167 Employment prospects for humanities and arts majors will be the topic of one of 14 lectures, presentations and talks to be offered at Parents’ Weekend on Feb. 27 and 28, 2015.

They are also part of the learning ethos at Stanford – and will drive the Stanford/Warner Music Group Leadership Initiative.</p> <p>The goal of this initiative is to identify and develop a new generation of undergraduate Stanford students from across educational disciplines – music, computer science, product design, economics and electrical engineering – for leadership roles in the ever-changing music business.</p> <p>Each year, a select group of students in their junior year of study will participate in the program by taking a course co-developed with Warner Music Group (WMG). WMG is committed to an initial program period of five years.</p> <p>&#8220;I am excited that this new collaboration will offer our students hands-on experience working in this fast-changing creative industry,&#8221; said Matthew Tiews, Stanford&#8217;s executive director of arts programs. &#8220;We hope the program will also bring out the skills, talents and entrepreneurial spirit of Stanford students from all disciplines in order to develop new approaches and leadership in this field.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>How it works</strong></p> <p>Year one of the program begins now with the admission process. Juniors are invited to apply before Jan. 30, 2015, for participation in this academic year.</p> <p>The application consists of a resume, a transcript and a brief written expression of interest in participating, detailing experience and preparation and the type of professional experience the student is most interested in pursuing. A portfolio of relevant work (i.e., musical work, technical inventions, marketing campaigns, etc.) is optional.</p> <p>The selection committee is chaired by Tiews and includes an interdisciplinary group of Stanford faculty and key staff from across the university. The committee will make preliminary decisions in February 2015, at which point Stanford will work with WMG to finalize the selection. This process will likely include an interview or other interface between students and WMG staff to determine fit, with final selection to be announced by March 2015.</p> <p>The program will have three required components, to take place in the following sequence:</p> <p>Students must complete, by the end of their junior year, the new course co-developed with WMG and to be offered starting in spring 2015 called <em>Changing World of Popular Music</em>. The course will feature a rotating group of guest artists and executives.</p> <p>Beginning summer 2015, participants will be given a 10-week paid &#8220;in-house&#8221; assignment with WMG or one of its program partners. By design, these summer assignments will be highly challenging and rewarding opportunities across the music industry, where technology is reshaping the future and innovation provides tremendous opportunities (and for which students will be eligible to receive $8,000).</p> <p>Upon returning to campus from summer assignments, students must begin work on intensive capstone projects designed to address opportunities for innovation and to be presented at the end of the senior year ($2,000 per student per project).</p> <p>Upon completion, WMG may seek to offer support in further developing the projects and careers of leaders emerging from the program.</p> <p>&#8220;This innovative new collaboration brings together the extraordinary creativity and entrepreneurial vision of leaders in music, tech, business and education to inspire and educate the music industry&#8217;s next generation of leaders,&#8221; said Cameron Strang, CEO and chairman of Warner Bros. Records and Warner/Chappell Music.</p> <p><strong>Music momentum on campus</strong></p> <p>The level of interest and participation in music is high on the Stanford campus. There are 35 student music groups, and the Department of Music reviews more than 1,000 arts supplements in music during the college application process every year. Student interest in live music brought back spring concerts at fabled Frost Amphitheater. More than 200 pianos are scattered around campus for easy access.</p> <p>There is even a new music major.</p> <p>Following action by the Faculty Senate last spring, Stanford is now offering on a pilot basis new undergraduate majors integrating humanities subjects and computer science. A new joint major in computer science and music, or CS + M, is among the first of them.</p> <p>The new degrees are distinct from dual degrees or double majors. Rather than completing all of the requirements for two separate majors, students who choose a joint major will pursue a curriculum integrating coursework from both disciplines. In the case of CS + M, the coursework is very much in line with the Stanford/Warner program goals.</p> <p>Following on the heels of the joint major announcement, Stanford collaborated with Strang and WMG to launch <em>Creativity: Music to My Ears</em>, a free, massive open online course (MOOC) teaching creative problem-solving skills through the lens of music.</p> <p>Taught by Stanford engineering Professor Tina Seelig, the course features contributions of WMG artists, songwriters and executives. Participating artists include Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park, Nate Ruess from Fun., Tegan and Sara, Jason Mraz, Josh Groban and more.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m passionate about education, and Stanford is leading the world in fostering creativity and innovation,&#8221; said Groban. &#8220;It&#8217;s great to see Warner develop this rich partnership, and I&#8217;m excited to have the opportunity to lend my efforts to the collaboration.&#8221;</p> <p>Bringing a taste of Stanford education to participants from around the world, <em>Creativity: Music to My Ears</em> combines individual and team-based challenges and interviews with artists, executives and Stanford faculty experts for a one-of-a-kind online learning experience. All of the projects in the experiential course deal with some aspect of music, including listening, creating and sharing.</p> <p>During Strang&#8217;s visit to campus in October, he participated in a Q&amp;A with students in the new course <em>Real Industry: Music &amp; Audio Technology</em> taught by Jay LeBoeuf, an adjunct lecturer with Stanford&#8217;s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.</p> <p>Noting what he calls a huge chasm between students and the industry, LeBoeuf said the Stanford/Warner collaboration bridges the arts and music business in an innovative, applied, creative way.</p> <p>&#8220;We need symbiotic relationships to yield the next generation of leaders in music business and technology,&#8221; he said.</p> <p>He added, &#8220;WMG is proud to be part of such an important, forward-looking program with Stanford, whose students change the world, and we are committed to using our resources and expertise to create the highest levels of engagement and opportunities for the students. Today&#8217;s digital natives are defining the new era of music, and these students will lead it.&#8221;</p> http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/11/20/stanford-and-the-music-industry-collaborate-to-create-leaders/feed/ 0 Harry Elam gives undergraduate education annual report http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/24/harry-elam-gives-undergraduate-education-annual-report/ http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/24/harry-elam-gives-undergraduate-education-annual-report/#comments Fri, 24 Oct 2014 16:31:29 +0000 kate Academics at Stanford http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/?p=1145 At a recent faculty senate meeting, Harry J.

Elam Jr., vice provost for undergraduate education, discussed undergraduate education, focusing on <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/features/2014/thinking-matters/">Thinking Matters</a>, which is designed to introduce incoming students to college-level thinking by having them tackle problems, questions and issues of significant import. It is now in its third year.</p> <p>Elam said surveys have shown that the courses are popular with both students and faculty, and as a result, it has been easier to recruit faculty members to develop and teach the courses. Freshmen are required to take at least one Thinking Matters course.</p> <p>He said the fear that the humanities would suffer when Thinking Matters replaced Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) has proved to be unfounded. In fact, the two most popular Thinking Matters courses this year – What Is Love? and Evil – are humanities courses, taught by medievalists and philosophers, he said.</p> <p>Elam said the 27 courses in this year&#8217;s Thinking Matters catalog present a wide range of offerings from across the university, including a course on cancer from Stanford Medical School; on the rules of war from Stanford Law School and the Political Science Department; and on meeting the global sustainability challenge from the School of Earth Sciences and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.</p> <p>&#8220;Because students only have to take one Thinking Matters course, instead of the three courses they took with IHUM, we can have smaller class sizes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can have class sizes of 60 to 100 students, rather than the 250 that we saw in IHUM.</p> <p>&#8220;What that means is that it is a more intimate experience for students, faculty and the fellows that are the section teaching staff for the course.&#8221;</p> <p>Elam discussed several other new undergraduate programs, including Immersion in the Arts: Living in Culture (ITALIC), a yearlong residential program designed to showcase the arts as an essential part of scholarly and public life, and the future Stanford in New York, a pilot program scheduled to accept its first cohort of 20 juniors in autumn 2015.</p> http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/24/harry-elam-gives-undergraduate-education-annual-report/feed/ 0 Provost addresses the Stanford community on Ebola http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/24/provost-addresses-the-stanford-community-on-ebola/ http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/24/provost-addresses-the-stanford-community-on-ebola/#comments Fri, 24 Oct 2014 16:24:55 +0000 kate Health at Stanford Safety at Stanford http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/?p=1137 In an Oct. 23 message to the Stanford community regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Provost John Etchemendy and Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Health Center, said the university has established protocols to reduce the risks to the community posed by the virus, and to identify, isolate and begin care should the campus <em><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/24/provost-addresses-the-stanford-community-on-ebola/">read more...</a></em> <p>In an Oct. 23 message to the Stanford community regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Provost John Etchemendy and Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden Health Center, said the university has established protocols to reduce the risks to the community posed by the virus, and to identify, isolate and begin care should the campus have a case in the Stanford Health Care network.</p> <p>&#8220;We are confident of our plans for handling a local case of Ebola in our emergency room and for caring for such a patient within our hospital isolation units,&#8221; they wrote, adding that the university is fortunate to have a world-class medical facility and expert personnel. &#8220;We have and will continue to train our Stanford Medicine staff using state-of-the-art simulations of an Ebola scenario.&#8221;</p> <p>Etchemendy said the university has been monitoring the high-level federal warnings about travel to the Ebola regions since the summer, and recalled or cancelled summer academic programs to the region.</p> <p>&#8220;Stanford has a current restriction in place prohibiting Stanford-related travel by any community member to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the three countries where Ebola outbreaks continue,&#8221; the message states.</p> <p>&#8220;We imposed this restriction due to the uncertainty of travel and safety logistics, as well as health care constraints in these areas. The public health infrastructure in these countries is severely strained as the outbreak grows, and the security situation in these countries is unstable and may worsen.&#8221;</p> <p>At present, Stanford Medicine does not plan to send any organized medical support team to the affected area. Some people may still want to volunteer their expertise in West Africa during the crisis, Etchemendy said, adding that Stanford respects that selfless and humanitarian personal choice.</p> <p>&#8220;But any Stanford, faculty, staff or student who wishes to undertake personal, voluntary travel to these specific countries should be aware that Stanford&#8217;s ability to provide medical support or evacuation in the event of illness or exposure will be severely limited, and potentially in the hands of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. State Department, beyond our control,&#8221; the message states.</p> <p>Speaking at Thursday&#8217;s Faculty Senate meeting, Etchemendy encouraged the Stanford community to contribute to relief efforts.</p> <p>All individuals traveling to those areas should register their trip in Stanford&#8217;s travel registry at the Office of International Affairs, Etchemendy said.</p> <p>Etchemendy said anyone who travels to an Ebola-affected area will be required to contact campus health offices for an evaluation prior to their return to campus – the Vaden Health Center for students and the Occupational Health Center for employees.</p> <p>&#8220;Any employee or visitor who has traveled to or arrived from the endemic Ebola area – Liberia, Serra Leone and Guinea – for any reason will be required to stay away from campus for 21 days following the completion of travel,&#8221; the message states. &#8220;Arrangements and support for this isolation period may be available and should have prior approval.&#8221;</p> <p>Campus units expecting visitors from the endemic Ebola countries should contact Brendan Walsh – washbm@stanford.edu or (650) 725-0076 – in the Office of International Affairs before their planned arrival to determine steps to take before the visitors are permitted to enter campus.</p> <p>&#8220;To date, we have not identified any member of our community, or any visitor to campus, who is at elevated risk for Ebola,&#8221; the message states.</p> <p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers Ebola to pose little risk to persons in the United States at this time. The Ebola virus is only spread through direct contact with bodily fluids of a person who is sick with, or has died from, Ebola or objects contaminated with the virus. Ebola is not a respiratory disease like the flu; Ebola is not transmitted through the air.</p> <p>While a case of Ebola within the Stanford community is unlikely, Etchemendy said the outbreak of the deadly virus was an opportunity to remind everyone of the basic precautions they should take to avoid the spread of any communicable disease.</p> <p>&#8220;We encourage every member of the Stanford community who is able to do so to get a flu shot, either from your own doctor or in one of our free flu vaccination clinics ongoing now,&#8221; the message states. &#8220;It is also important to practice proper hygiene throughout the winter months and to avoid infecting others if you become sick.&#8221;</p> <p>Finally, Etchemendy encouraged the Stanford community to play close attention to the evolving situation and to stay informed by visiting the Stanford Responds to Ebola website.</p> <p>The website presents updates on the university&#8217;s response to the outbreak; details for travelers to the affected region; and FAQs and links to the CDC and the World Health Organization. It also includes a video of Stanford and CDC experts talking about the health, governance, security and ethical dimensions of Ebola.</p> <p>For more, visit http://ebola.stanford.edu</p> http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/24/provost-addresses-the-stanford-community-on-ebola/feed/ 0 Stanford responds to Ebola questions http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/20/stanford-responds-to-ebola-questions/ http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/20/stanford-responds-to-ebola-questions/#comments Mon, 20 Oct 2014 18:06:24 +0000 kate Health at Stanford http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/?p=1133 What has Stanford done so far in preparation for a possible case of Ebola among members of the Stanford community?

Since Ebola began to emerge as an issue, the university has been planning intensively and following best practices and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We have held meetings of the campus infection control working group, representing many departments across campus, in concert with county public health officials, since summer. With the emergence of the U.S. index case in Dallas, the pace of planning has been stepped up recently, and operational subgroups are actively working on updating existing contingency plans for medical care, identification and support in the unlikely event of a potential case occurring at or near Stanford. Additionally, policy and support guidance has been developed for travelers to and from the affected countries with community outbreaks, as well as for other areas of West Africa.</p> <p><strong>At what level do you assess the risk from Ebola to members of the Stanford community?</strong><br /> The risk is very, very small. For members of our campus community, our students and faculty who returned to campus this fall, we are now well past the critical 21-day window for Ebola. Nevertheless, we are continuously monitoring the emerging situation and adapting existing infection control planning efforts in order to further reduce that small risk.</p> <p><strong>How would the university’s ongoing protocols for disease control help diminish the possibility of an Ebola infection on campus?</strong><br /> We have isolation plans, and we would communicate quickly and effectively. Our protocols enable us to identify possible scenarios, designate a range of potential response actions to mitigate the risk, and allow us to quickly share information and communicate needed steps to the necessary groups, such as staff and emergency responders.</p> <p><strong>What advice has Stanford offered to students, staff and faculty who might be considering traveling to the West African countries most affected so far?</strong><br /> Stanford is asking that all non-essential travel be deferred to the three countries with community spread of Ebola: Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Travelers are also advised that travel to other parts of West Africa should be carefully evaluated to account for possible disruption due to local country restrictions on incoming and outgoing visitors, even if those areas are not presently at risk of Ebola virus disease.</p> <p><strong>What type of outreach has the university done to the campus community thus far to educate them about Ebola and its risks?</strong><br /> Instruction and guidance will be posted to this site, including links to instructions for returning travelers from West Africa and university guidance for travelers. These instructions are consistent with guidance documents from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This site will be regularly updated as information becomes available.</p> <p><strong>What advice does the university offer to students, faculty and staff to diminish the possibility they could contract Ebola?</strong><br /> We are always educating our campus community to minimize the spread of any infectious disease, whether it would be the flu or Ebola. It’s always a good idea to practice good hand-washing and basic hygiene. That cuts down on the risk of person-to-person spread of many infectious diseases. Right now, travel to the three affected countries with community outbreak is strongly discouraged. Returning travelers are urged to check in with our health services and self-monitor for signs of illness for 21 days after return.</p> <p><strong>Is Stanford Hospital equipped and able to handle an Ebola case should it occur in this area?</strong><br /> We are fortunate to have a world-class medical facility, and expert personnel, at the university. Stanford Hospital, like many hospitals across the country, has elevated its alert status. If needed, they are equipped and fully prepared to accept an Ebola case.</p> <p><strong>Are you worried that the nation’s focus on Ebola right now might diminish the precautions people take around influenza?</strong><br /> Our flu vaccine clinics are always underway at this time of the year, and we make free shots available to all members of our campus community. There’s been good distribution and acceptance of vaccinations, so we are pleased that our faculty, staff and students remain focused on prevention. Ebola has not been a distraction, but perhaps a reminder of the importance of good self-care. It is very important to remind everyone that, unlike the influenza virus, Ebola transmission requires close contact with someone with disease symptoms and is not transmitted through the air.</p> <p>For more information, visit <a href="http://ebola.stanford.edu">http://ebola.stanford.edu</a></p> http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/20/stanford-responds-to-ebola-questions/feed/ 0 Stanford’s safety net helps students in distress http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/10/stanfords-safety-net-helps-students-in-distress/ http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/10/10/stanfords-safety-net-helps-students-in-distress/#comments Fri, 10 Oct 2014 18:02:23 +0000 kate Health at Stanford http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/?p=1117 The director of Vaden Health Center recently talked to members of the Faculty Senate about the mental health and well-being of students.

Friedman, director of Vaden Health Center, recently reported that Stanford has established an extensive &#8220;safety net&#8221; of mental health and well-being resources on campus to help students who may be experiencing psychological distress.</p> <p>Speaking to the Faculty Senate, Friedman encouraged faculty members to contact someone in the safety net if they are concerned about a student. He said early recognition and intervention can help address mental health issues before they become more difficult to mitigate and treat.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to start with a very provocative statement, which is that stress is up and students may not have the resilience to overcome that level of stress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s true among students, not necessarily every student, of course, but it may explain why you as faculty members on campus encounter students with signs of stress.&#8221;</p> <p>He told the senate to keep in mind that the late teenage and young adult years are a peak time for the first onset of mental health conditions.</p> <p>Friedman said faculty can play a critical role in supporting the mental health and well-being of students by recognizing the signs of psychological distress in students, intervening by engaging the students in conversation and listening to them talk about their problems, and encouraging them to get help.</p> <p>He urged faculty to encourage feedback from teaching assistants and course assistants if they sense that a student is in distress, and to pay attention to any of these warning signs:</p> <p><em>Change in participation and/or performance</em><br /> <em> Decline in the quality of academic work</em><br /> <em> Frequent absences from a lab, office or class</em><br /> <em> Change in mood or appearance</em><br /> <em> Unusual or troubling behavior, including angry outbursts, inappropriate dark humor and vague threats to harm themselves or others</em><br /> <em> Failure to respond to repeated attempts to communicate</em><br /> <em> Concerns expressed by other students</em><br /> <em> He encouraged faculty members to trust their instincts.</em></p> <p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re concerned there is a problem, you&#8217;re probably right,&#8221; Friedman said.</p> <p>Friedman said faculty members should seek help and advice whenever the demands of the situation exceed their comfort level.</p> <p>The key thing for faculty to remember, he said, is that Stanford has many resources available to help students get the best possible referral.</p> <p>When encouraging students to seek help, a faculty member could say, &#8220;I know that there are many caring and helpful staff who can listen and help you access the many resources that are available to help students who may be experiencing difficulties.&#8221;</p> <p>Friedman encouraged faculty to reach out to trained staff at Stanford who can assess the seriousness of the situation, develop options for a response and gather the resources needed to respond.</p> <p>The people who compose the safety net can be found in a new online resource directory, Wellness Network at Stanford, at wellness.stanford.edu.</p> <p>The online directory is a comprehensive, searchable site that links students, faculty and staff, and family and friends to immediate crisis-intervention services and professional counseling, as well as academic support services, community centers and student groups. It features more than 150 resources and reflects the spectrum of mental health and well-being support available on campus. Select off-campus resources also are included.</p> <p>Friedman said help is available 24 hours a day. He said the &#8220;go-to staff&#8221; include the residence deans, graduate life deans and staff in Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at Vaden.

Why?</strong></p> <p>Studies here and elsewhere show that students who talk with their parents about drinking have fewer alcohol-related issues. In other words, parents have more influence than they might suspect. We want to create a partnership with parents to prevent high-risk drinking among Stanford students. We hope, too, that candid conversations continue throughout students’ college careers.</p> <p><strong>What programs does Stanford offer to help prevent high-risk drinking among students?</strong></p> <p>We have many programs, beginning with the online educational program all freshmen must take before arriving on campus. Once here, they’ll find Cardinal Nights, which are alcohol-free programs designed so that no student feels isolated by a decision not to drink. Most events are packed beyond capacity, and nearly one third of attendees say they were likely to have been drinking had they not attended. In addition, our staff visits all residences with first-year students in the first several weeks of classes to provide alcohol education. Our objective is to change campus culture so that high-risk drinking is not considered a rite of passage any more.</p> <p><strong>How does drinking at Stanford compare with other colleges nationwide?</strong></p> <p>Stanford is very similar in terms of national norms for quantity and frequency of drinking. Surveys show that most Stanford students drink moderately or not at all. But some percentage engages in high-risk or “binge” drinking, often with hard alcohol. So, we’re dealing with the same issues as other colleges and universities. We consistently talk to our peers to share information and ideas.</p> <p><strong>What are the consequences of student drinking at Stanford?</strong></p> <p>Excessive drinking can—and does—result in arrest. Stanford students are not immune from prosecution and are commonly cited for being a minor in possession of alcohol or being intoxicated in public—which involves being arrested and transported to jail. Almost all of Stanford’s emergency hospital transports result from high-risk drinking shots of hard liquor. Another thing that worries us a lot is the relationship between drinking behaviors that harm others such as assaults and violence.</p> <p><strong>What advice do you give to parents to help them talk to their children about alcohol use?</strong></p> <p>Just having a conversation appears to be enough to affect alcohol use. Be open, frank and honest with your son or daughter. Provide clear and consistent expectations for them. Things have changed since we were in college. High-risk drinking activities such as rapid hard-liquor consumption are different now and are very dangerous.</p> <p>Visit the <a href="https://alcohol.stanford.edu/http://">website of the Office of Alcohol Policy and Education</a>.</p> http://www.stanford.edu/dept/ucomm/cgi-bin/parentsnewsletter/2014/09/24/five-things-parents-should-know-about-alcohol-at-stanford/feed/ 0
