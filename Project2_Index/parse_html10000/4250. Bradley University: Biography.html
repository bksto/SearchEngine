Glasser was appointed the tenth president of Bradley University in 2007. She is also the first female president of the University, which was founded by pioneering philanthropist Lydia Moss Bradley in 1897. A dynamic and visionary leader with extensive experience in university administration, collaborative leadership, fundraising, and community development, President Glasser has made a significant impact by energizing students and faculty, leading a major advancement effort, and engaging alumni across the country.  Under President Glasser's leadership, Bradley has enrolled the best classes academically in the University's history for Fall 2012, 2013 and 2014 based on ACT scores. Other academic initiatives include the launch of both a Pre-Law Center and a Pre-Professional Health Advisory Center. In recent years, Bradley created programs in interactive media, game and web design, social media marketing, accelerated nursing, global supply chain management, hospitality leadership, sports communication, and a dietetics internship curriculum. In 2009, Bradley’s Executive MBA program was named after Dr. Theresa Falcon, the first EMBA program in the world to be named for a woman and by a woman. President Glasser and the Board of Trustees announced the creation of the Robert and Carolyn Turner School of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in 2012. Bradley University is among the first universities in the nation to have a school of entrepreneurship and the first established as a freestanding academic unit. Bradley is currently implementing a five-year strategic plan for 2012-17 that was developed collaboratively and included feedback from across the University. The plan focuses on three overarching strategic goals: enhancing educational excellence and value of a Bradley education; enhancing Bradley’s living and working environment; and enhancing Bradley’s operations, endowment, and resource efficiencies to support activities of national distinction. President Glasser launched the largest comprehensive capital campaign, the campaign for a Bradley Renaissance, in the University’s history. The campaign that changed the face of the University surpassed its goal of $150 million. The first phase of the Renaissance included construction of the $30 million Markin Family Student Recreation Center and a 600-car parking deck. The $50 million, 4,200-seat Renaissance Coliseum, home to the women’s basketball and volleyball teams, and the Basketball Practice Facility opened in 2010. The $12 million Hayden-Clark Alumni Center was completed in 2011, earning LEED Silver certification from the USGBC. The expansion and renovation of Westlake Hall, the second oldest building on campus, was completed in 2012, earning LEED Gold certification from the USGBC. A student-focused university with an emphasis on student-learning and success, President Glasser is a champion of students. She was nationally recognized for her student engagement by the Chronicle of Higher Education, which published a story about the Office Hours she holds monthly for students. President Glasser serves as the chair of the NCAA Division I Committee on Institutional Performance (CIP), formerly the NCAA Division I Committee on Athletics Certification, as vice chair of its Executive Subcommittee and was a past member of the Board of Directors: Division I Presidential Advisory Group. She is a member of the Commission on Women in Higher Education Task Force, the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, and a former member of the American Council on Education Commission on Effective Leadership. President Glasser was the honorary chair of the 25th annual Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure in Peoria, hometown of Ms. Komen and her sister, Nancy Brinker, founder of the Komen Foundation and Race for the Cure. In 2011 she was honored with the Peoria YWCA Education and Care of Children Award for her many contributions at Bradley. President Glasser also was the recipient of the Bradley University 2010 Megan Fong Inspiration Award.
