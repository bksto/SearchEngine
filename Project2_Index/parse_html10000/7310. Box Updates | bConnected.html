This means over 1,300 apps that open files from and/or save files to Box, including popular tools like Notability and Smartsheets. Visit https://app.box.com/apps/ to see the official list of Box Apps, and more. 2/6/15 Box Notes Support for Tables, Version History, and Images Via Upload   Box has added support for tables, version history and image insert via upload (and soon via drag and drop) in Box Notes. For version history, new versions save roughly every 5 minutes or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Users can access past versions by hovering over the word "Saved" in the toolbar and clicking "Show version history". See "Box Notes: Overview & FAQs" to learn more.    1/27/14 External Image Support in Box Notes Box Notes now supports external images, so users can choose to either insert images into Box Notes by copying and pasting links to external images from any site or by copying and pasting a shared link from an existing image on Box. For more information, please see "Box Notes: How do I Insert an Image"?   12/8/14 Change in Sync Behavior There has been a change in Box Sync's behavior with deletions. In the past, all synced folders that are deleted locally are unsynced on the Box web application. Based on customer feedback, Box has changed this behavior for both personal and collaborative folders. If a user deletes a synced personal folder locally, that folder will delete both from their local system and on the Box web application. If a user attempts to delete a collaborative folder, they will receive a warning message that the folder will delete for all collaborators and choose to either confirm the deletion or unsync instead. Read more about deleting synched folders. Learn more about Box’s recent features and updates.
