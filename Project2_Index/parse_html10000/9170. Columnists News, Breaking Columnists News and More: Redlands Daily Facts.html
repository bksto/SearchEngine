This is the third time they have worked together. Wait. Maybe it’s the fourth. “Like Babe Ruth said,” Goossen said. “I hit ’em. You count ’em.” Molina was last seen in Las Vegas, without Goossen, in September. His trainer that night was Jose Santa Cruz, because Molina lives in Covina and didn’t want to make the daily round-trip to Van Nuys. That showed...
