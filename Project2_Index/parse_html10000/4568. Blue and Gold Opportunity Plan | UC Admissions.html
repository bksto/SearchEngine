UC's Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan will ensure that you will not have to pay UC’s systemwide tuition and fees out of your own pocket if you are a California resident whose total family income is less than $80,000 a year and you qualify for financial aid — and that's just for starters. Blue and Gold students with sufficient financial need can qualify for even more grant aid to help reduce the cost of attending. Type of aid: Gift aid (from multiple sources) How to apply: FAFSA/California Dream Act Application + Cal Grant GPA Verification Form (you will be automatically considered when you submit these forms by March 2; there is no separate application for this program) What's covered If you are eligible, your systemwide tuition and fees will be fully covered by scholarship or grant money. The plan combines all sources of scholarship and grant awards you receive (federal, state, UC and private) to go toward covering your tuition and fees. Students with greater financial need can qualify for even more grant support to help defray other educational expenses (like books, housing, transportation, etc.). You don't need to fill out a separate application to qualify for the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan. You will receive the benefits of the Blue and Gold plan automatically if you qualify. Eligibility requirements Submit a FAFSA or California Dream Act Application and Cal Grant GPA Verification Form by March 2 California resident or have AB 540 status Demonstrate total family income below $80,000 and financial need, as determined for federal need-based aid programs Be in your first four years as a UC undergraduate (first two for transfer students) Meet other campus basic requirements for UC grant aid (for example, be enrolled at least half-time during the academic year, meet campus academic progress standards, not be in default on student loans, etc.) Blue + Gold factsheets English [PDF] Spanish [PDF] Chinese [PDF] Vietnamese [PDF] University of California Admissions sitemap A-Z index Contact © 2014 UC Regents
