The Right Note Through a conservatory approach in a liberal arts setting, our students learn to perform, interpret and teach music in a rich learning environment that provides a broad education and intense training. University of Redlands > Academics > School of Music School of Music In the School of Music our goal is to educate the whole musician, not just to train a performer. All great performances go far beyond technical mastery to include a sense of history, society, culture and art. Through a conservatory approach in a liberal arts setting, our students learn to perform, interpret and teach music in a rich learning environment that provides a broad education and intense training. Our studio teachers are among the finest musicians and teachers in Southern California. The classes are small and your teachers will know you as a person, not just as a name on a class roster. For further information regarding ensembles, audition dates, scholarships and financial aid you may find it useful to review the School of Music brochure.
