Welcome to California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) from Student Affairs! CSUSM offers our students a dynamic academic environment where they can thrive and attain the skills they need for success in life. Together with parents and families, the goal of Student Affairs is to support our students in attaining these goals. Student Affairs serves as the backbone for the student experience at CSUSM: from orientation to class registration, from financial aid to career services, and from academic support services to rich cultural experiences, we try to provide a pathway to success. This website serves as just one of many tools that CSUSM provides to students and their families to aid in their success. Information about housing, financial aid, important dates and other services can all be found on these pages. If you can’t find what you need here, our diligent and dedicated staff of Student Affairs professionals can assist. Contact our Student Outreach and Referral (SOAR) office for assistance — it’s the “first stop for all things student.” Again, we’re happy to have you as part of our extended CSUSM family—let us know how Student Affairs can help you!
