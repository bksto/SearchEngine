Our executive officers- the President, Executive Vice President, External Affairs Vice President, Academic Affairs Vice President, and the Student Advocate each work with different University administrators and offices to ensure that the Berkeley students receive all the support they need on campus. From textbook scholarships offered by our Office of the Academic Affairs Vice President, to legal support and advice given by our Student Advocate's Office, ASUC can provide the support you need as a Berkeley student as one of the largest and most autonomous student governments in the nation. Representation ASUC is a group of passionate elected and appointed officials, as well as hired interns and staff who represent the original University of California's large and diverse student population. ASUC's 20-person elected Senate class and 5 elected officials represent the student population in their meetings with University staff, considered Senate bills, written press releases, and other ASUC decisions, striving to make sure each and every student on campus feels like their voice is heard.
