The Senior Class Challenge is an annual giving program designed to encourage and continue this tradition of philanthropy among graduating seniors. Senior Class Challenge gifts can be allotted to one of these sources: 1) Annual Fund, 2) your college or school, and We Are Aggie Pride, an emergency fund for students in a time of need. This year, graduating seniors were asked to give $20.12 or more in honor of their graduation year. Funds raised through the Senior Class Challenge support many things that enrich the student experience, such as: Undergraduate scholarships Fellowships Research New courses and areas of study Lab and classroom equipment Programs that were meaningful to students during their time at UC Davis ↑ Back to top UC Davis Development and Alumni Relations | One Shields Ave. | Davis, CA 95616 development@ucdavis.edu | Privacy & Accessibility | Sitemap | Last update: March 18, 2014 Copyright © The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus.
