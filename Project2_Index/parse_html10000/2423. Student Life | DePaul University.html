The life you live outside of the classroom can be just as important when it comes to your ability to learn and grow. That’s why we’re very proud that we’re known for these two student traits: diversity and happiness (we’ve ranked No. 1 in both areas). When you add the city of Chicago into the mix, with its many opportunities for fun and service, you have a student life setup that can’t be beat. Life in Chicago Going to school at DePaul means living in Chicago, one of the most beautiful and vibrant cities in the U.S. As the country's third-largest city, Chicago has every opportunity for learning and fun imaginable, from renowned museums, theater and music to professional sports. It’s definitely big, but Chicago is also known for its Midwestern friendliness, a strong sense of neighborhood, and its ethnic communities, food and culture. And summers in Chicago are simply the best, whether you’re at a festival or relaxing at a beach.   Life on Campus For each activity in the city there’s another equally exciting possibility on campus. With more than 300 on-campus clubs and organizations, you're bound to find something that fits your interests. Host a show on Radio DePaul, captain an intramural floor hockey team, or attend a lecture by a famous guest speaker. Or maybe you’ll get involved collecting clothing for the homeless, or cheer on the Blue Demons​ at our Big East Conference games.   The DePaul Activities Board (DAB), the event-organizing body of the university, pulls it all together. Members of DAB organize, collect and communicate a wide variety of events, from Homecoming and FEST (a spring outdoor concert and festival), to guest speakers, live music, movies, comedy shows, and much more.   Technology on Campus You'll have access to the latest technology on both of our main campuses—Lincoln Park and the Loop:   Campus-wide wireless internet State-of-the-art computer labs Remote printing to computer labs Free training on the latest software Advanced online learning technology with two-way video conferencing Community Service and Real-World Engagement One of the ways we prepare you for life and work after college is through community-based service learning, or real-world experiences that bring theory to life. Here are a few examples of how DePaul students give back to the community:   Participate in a service immersion trip during spring break to help repair and build homes in Appalachia Take part in New Student Service Day or Vincentian Service Day​ by cleaning neighborhood sites and spending time playing with children Volunteer through the St. Vincent de Paul Parish or other area community-based organizations that help feed those in need ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Additional Page Content 1 Right Sidebar Content See what it's like to be a student here: Watch our Life@DePaul videos.
