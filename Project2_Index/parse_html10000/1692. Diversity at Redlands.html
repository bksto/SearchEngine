About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > Diversity at Redlands Diversity at Redlands No matter who you are, at Redlands, you fit right in. Diversity is not simply  part of the strategic vision at the University of Redlands—it is an active daily learning experience. Through nationally recognized programs and unique services, we challenge you to think beyond your own experiences and to consider other perspectives. At Redlands, we define diversity as the differences that make each of us unique. From learning styles to social class to gender identity, our University community is strengthened by our appreciation for individuals and our ability to find commonalities amongst the differences. The University’s Office of Campus Diversity & Inclusion (CDI) serves as a catalyst for the campus community on matters related to diversity, ensuring that we are educating all “hearts and minds”, making Redlands a welcoming environment for everyone.
