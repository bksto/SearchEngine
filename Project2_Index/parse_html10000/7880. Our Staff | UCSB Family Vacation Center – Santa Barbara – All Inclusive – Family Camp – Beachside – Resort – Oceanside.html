Our Staff Our counselors, consisting mainly of outstanding UCSB students, are one of the most important assets of the Family Vacation Center. These exceptional people are enthusiastic, energetic, and positive role models for your children. We encourage vacationers to socialize with staff members—invite them to have dinner with your family and become friends with them. We choose our staff from a large pool of applicants, basing decisions on each individual’s skills and personality. Every member of our staff, from front desk attendant to age group counselor, is first aid and CPR certified. Plus, they go through an extensive screening and training process—so you can be assured that you and your entire family are in safe hands. 2014 Summer Staff Name Position School Years on Staff Management Team Sheri Fruhwirth Director SDSU Alum 4 Sandy Thor Business Manager UCSB Alum 5 Tiffany Sellars Assistant Director Northern Arizona 9 Courtney Anderson Crafts Supervisor University of West Florida Alum 3 Andrew Angles Aquatics Supervisor University of Chicago 3 CJ Gurske Programs Supervisor Chico State Alum 3 Chris Holdaway Front Desk Supervisor Northern Arizona 3 Cami Kwan Kids Group Supervisor Rochester Institute of Technology 3 Chelsea Patton Tennis Supervisor Eastern Washington 2 Perri Armstrong Small World Supervisor Moorpark College 1 Staff Kriss Heron Programs University of Colorado 4 Elijah Bowin Aquatics UCSB 3 Christian Campos Programs UCSB Alum 3 Alexia Enriquez Front Desk/Babysitting Coordinator UCSB Alum 3 Ally Kasper Small World/ Babysitting Coordinator SBCC 3 Peter Vandenbelt Photographer UCSB Alum 3 Tyler Washington Kids Group UCSB 3 Chris Bowersox Programs UCSB Alum 2 Christi Connors Kids Group UCSB Alum 2 Clare Cummins Front Desk University of Waterloo 2 Mo Dahdul Kids Group UCSB Alum 2 Nik Frey Aquatics UCSB 2 Nick McKeon Kids Group UCSB Alum 2 Natalie McMahon Kids Group UCSB 2 Kevin Meredith Kids Group Cal Poly SLO 2 Adrienne Moore Hospitality Coordinator UCSB 2 Scott Polaske Programs UCSB 2 Dominic Riolo Aquatics UCSB Alum 2 Timmy Ryan Aquatics UCSB 2 Derek Simons Kids Group American University 2 Taylor Steinhilber Kids Group UCSB 2 Danielle Sterling Kids Group UCSB 2 Maxine Ansaldo Small World UCSB 1 Michael Choo Crafts UCSC 1 Leah Divine Summer Inn Manager UCSB 1 Mikala Dougherty Summer Inn Manager College of DuPage 1 Kruze Dunn Aquatics Oxnard College 1 Margaret Gallagher Front Desk UCSB 1 Kara Godfrey Kids Group Sonoma State 1 Christian Hernandez Front Desk UCSB Alum 1 Jaclynn Heron Crafts Northern Arizona University 1 Rayeed Hossain Crafts UCSB 1 Kelly Ikeda Crafts UCSB 1 Matt Meredith Kids Group Cal Poly SLO 1 Matt Meyer Kids Group UCSB 1 Emily Nelson Kids Group UCLA 1 Melissa Olmeda Small World UCSB 1 John Pavia Kids Group UCSB 1 Dylan Perry Front Desk UCSB Alum 1 Caitlin Racich Programs Pepperdine Alum 1 Tristan Racich Aquatics Azusa Pacific 1 Kyle Skinner Programs UCSB 1 Lauren Stevens Small World UCSB 1 Annie Studer Kids Group University of Northern Colorado 1 Brian Ta Kids Group CSUN 1 Amanda Whitaker Small World Santa Clara University 1 Jacqueline Zintel Kids Group UCSB 1 Eliana Zwirn Kids Group UCSB 1 Our Directors Director: Sheri Fruhwirth Hometown: Kingman, AZ Years with FVC: Fourth Summer with the FVC!
