And that’s exactly what Valenzuela did: she was part of the swim and water polo teams all four years. “My experience was awesome,” she said. “It was much harder than my high school teams, but absolutely worth it.” She had fun out of the pool as well, while earning her bachelor’s degree in biology and chemistry with a minor in Asian studies. “I was lucky to get great roommates my freshman year and make friends with many on both teams,” Valenzuela says. “I loved my small classes and really getting to know some of the professors I had, like Teri Longin, Hongwei Lu, and Anne Cavender.” Valenzuela earned her master’s degree in library and information science from San Jose State University in 2012 and works in a public library. “It’s important to give back to the U of R, no matter how little it might be,” she said. “I like to give back to the Bulldog Bench in particular because I really value the student-athlete experience and all the staff who work to make participating in the sports so great: the coaches, the trainers, and everyone who works so hard to make sure our athletic facilities are in working condition.” See Also The Power of the Redlands Fund Leadership Giving What Can I Give To?
