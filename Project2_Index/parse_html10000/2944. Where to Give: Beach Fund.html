More than 20,000 alumni, parents and friends of the university contribute to the Beach Fund each year.  Gifts to the Beach Fund make it possible for our gifted students to earn the lifelong benefits of a quality CSULB education and protect the value of degrees already earned. Show your support and BEACH PRIDE! Senior Class Giving: My Beach Campaign The Senior Class Giving MyBeach Campaign is the first opportunity for students to give back to the University in honor of their graduation. Graduating students come together to participate in the Beach Fund and continue to demonstrate Beach Pride and Tradition beyond The Beach. Beach Fund Call Center The Beach Fund Call Center is a major part of the Annual Giving program. Student callers reach out to more than 60,000 alumni and parents each year to keep them informed of CSULB news and events, while encouraging community members to support The Beach. University Cabinet The University Cabinet is one of the newest private support groups on campus dedicated to developing the University.
