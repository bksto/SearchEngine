About Redlands University of Redlands > About Redlands > Office of the President > President's Cabinet > Dean, College of Arts & Sciences Dean, College of Arts & Sciences Kathy Ogren Dr. Kathy Ogren is dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. She started in the dean’s office in June 2011 following many years as a faculty member at the University in the history department and the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies. Ogren directed the Johnston Center from 1999-2007. She regularly contributes to the women's and gender studies and race and ethnic Studies programs, and she has taught in the Proudian Honors Program. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree in American studies from Scripps College and earned a Ph.D. in history from  Johns Hopkins University. She held the Virginia C. Hunsaker Chair in Distinguished Teaching at the University of Redlands from 2005-2011. Ogren’s teaching and research spans two decades, with an emphasis on historical and cultural changes situated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Often combining history, literature and music in her classes, Ogren regularly offers courses in American and African American History, women’s history, jazz and blues studies, and the modern American West. Ogren is the author of "The Jazz Revolution: Twenties America and the Meaning of Jazz," and with Bill McDonald, "Hard Travelin”: Livin’ and Learnin’ in the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies." Most recently, Ogren published “Out of the Father’s House into a Community of Readers,” in Encountering Disgrace: Reading and Teaching Coetzee’s Novel. Selected as a LENS Fellow at the University of Redlands in 2010, Ogren is at work on a GIS enhanced project entitled “Roots/Routes Music and Poetry in the North American West.” Long fascinated with the social significance of vernacular cultural forms, in particular jazz, blues, and cowboy poetry and music, Ogren values learning communities in which improvisational exchanges both transmit and create knowledge. As dean, Ogren seeks collaboratively to engage such improvisation with students, faculty colleagues, and administrators. Ogren will continue to teach on jazz and blues literature and the American West.
