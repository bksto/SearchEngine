About Us The Family Vacation Center is an all-inclusive family vacation. One week sessions are offered between the summer months of June and August. With meals, lodging, childcare, and activities included, we offer a variety of programs and events that aim to please all members of the family. From our popular wine tasting tour to our “gnarly” surf lessons, your family can enjoy planning-free fun at an affordable cost. Our childcare program makes the Family Vacation Center the “best vacation since becoming parents.” Our friendly college-aged staff will ensure the safety of your children, while providing them with exciting activities and entertainment. Best of all, our childcare program will allow parents the choice to relax in beautiful Santa Barbara or partake in a variety of unique adult-only activities. FVC History – The Family Vacation Center, originally called the “Alumni Vacation Center,” has been hosting families since 1969. Our program was created by the UCSB Alumni Association with the primary purpose of engaging Alumni and their families. Dale Lauderdale spearheaded the inaugural summer with a staff of 9. Today, we host about 2,000 guests each summer with a staff of 50 college-aged students. Overtime, the Family Vacation Center has developed countless family traditions, such as the cozy family campfire – s’mores, singing and sunsets included!
