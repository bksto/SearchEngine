View All 161 Guest Reviews Guest Reviews Rated 4.5 out of 5 by 161 reviewers. Rated 5.0 out of 5.0 by Suleetee Nice Clean Hotel The grounds and staff are very nice at this facility. My room was large and clean. The only drawback is the neighborhood around the hotel has fallen into steep decline in the past few years. It's great to be at the hotel, but I wouldn't want to explore the general neighborhood. March 4, 2015 Rated 5.0 out of 5.0 by Busy mom42 Perfect stay This is the second time we stayed here and both times we were nice and comfy! Comfortable roomy beds, wifi works great all four of us used at the same time with no problems, really good breakfast, excellent selection. I travel a lot with my daughter's that play sports and this hotel was so reasonably priced! Great bang for your buck! I highly recommend.
