The goal of the Office of Research is to promote outstanding research at UC Santa Barbara. The Office of Research helps the university community secure support for their research and creative activities. We work with all academic units to promote research throughout the university, and we have special responsibility for research done collaboratively across disciplines, departments, and schools. We ensure the integrity of UCSB research and provide assurance to governmental and private funding agencies and to the public that the research is conducted in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We work to make sure that research is integrated with the educational and service missions of the university. Finally, we help communicate to the university community and to the general public about the quality, breadth, and significance of research carried out at UCSB.
