Working in unison with the CSULB Alumni Association, the office provides services, coordinates programs and offers special events of interest to its alumni to heighten their interest in and strengthen their connection with their alma mater. Beyond Alumni Relations and Annual Giving, the broad mission of the unit includes the President's Associates and the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden, a favorite among our alumni and friends. I hope you will revisit The Beach often.. Every day the faculty and staff of our nationally ranked institution help provide students with the quintessential university experience. — Janice Hatanaka, '84 Associate Vice President Links To learn more about the benefits, services, alumni programs and ways to get involved, please visit the CSULB Alumni Association Website Index A B CA-CL CM-CZ D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z California State University, Long Beach 1250 Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, California 90840 562.985.4111 Website Credits Feedback
