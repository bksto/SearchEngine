Film: Arabesque on the Pirsomani Theme and The Rebel Sunday, March 8 | 3 p.m. | PFA Theater Arabesque on the Pirosmani Theme is a poetic meditation on the work of the Georgian painter Niko Pirosmani (1862–1918). The Rebel is a portrait of Sergei Paradjanov as a filmmaker, designer, and collage artist, made at the time when he was shooting his last film, Ashik Kerib. Filmed in Tbilisi, Yerevan, and Paris, this documentary includes archival footage and interviews reflecting upon the artist’s pluralistic view of the Caucasian people and their cultural traditions. Cazals also considers Paradjanov’s successive terms of imprisonment by the Soviet government and the artist’s strength of spirit Tickets required: $5.50 BAM/PFA Members; UC Berkeley Students,  $6.50 UC Berkeley Faculty, Staff, and Retirees; Non-UC Berkeley Students; Senior citizens (65 & over); Disabled Persons; Youth (17 & under),  $9.50 General Admission Ticket info: Buy tickets by calling 510-642-5249. Music: David Finckel, cello, and Wu Han, piano Sunday, March 8 | 3 p.m. | Hertz Concert Hall The husband and wife duo of cellist David Finckel and pianist Wu Han presents a program of gripping 20th-century Russian chamber works—music that is stately and lyrical.

In Han's capable hands, the nuance and texture of Scriabin's work is coaxed out with skill and precision. Tickets required: $56 Ticket info: Buy tickets online, or by calling 510-642-9988, or by emailing tickets@calperformances.org. Exhibit: SPEED, science in motion February 7 – May 3, 2015 every day | Lawrence Hall of Science Join us to learn about the science, engineering, and finesse that goes into Formula One racing and find out if you have what it takes to drive a 1,400 pound car at 200 mph. This exhibit is free with admission. Exhibit: Designing People February 11 – May 19, 2015 every day | Environmental Design Library, room 210 Wurster Hall The figures that inhabit architectural and landscape renderings are not the actual focus of the drawings. Homeowners, children, pets, shoppers, and condo-dwellers are included to convey the scale and functionality of a proposed design. They humanize and create an emotional appeal in what might otherwise appear to be sterile environments and allow the client to imagine how a space will be used. From the watercolor Victorian to the scalie hipster, this exhibit features more than a century of designers’ representations of people from the Environmental Design Archives. Film: Wildest Weather in the solar system 3D February 7 – June 12, 2015 every day | 10:30 a.m. | National Geographic 3D Theater Lawrence Hall of Science Witness the most beautiful, powerful, and mysterious weather phenomena in the solar system, shown in 3D at the Lawrence Hall of Science. From a storm the size of a 100-megaton hydrogen bomb, to a 400-year-old hurricane, to a dust tempest that could engulf entire planets, you'll be glad you live on Earth! Fly through the thick atmosphere of Venus, magnetic storms on the sun, liquid methane showers on Titan, and anticyclones whirling at hundreds of miles per hour on Jupiter. Tickets required: $4 plus admission Exhibit: Close to home yet far away March 2 – June 12, 2015 every day | 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. | 220 Stephens Hall Stephens Hall A painting can reside simultaneously in its material presence—physical, colored minerals, their arrangements on paper or silk—and its illusory presence—the evocation of illusion, forming in the viewer a convincing belief in the presence of space and time. The exchange between the real and the imagined is a perceptual experience where the personal and the public, the local and the foreign can exist simultaneously. Artist Craig Nagasawa uses the techniques of ancient Japanese painting in his work. He reconstructed these time-consuming processes as both a form of resistance to cultural erasure and an acknowledgement of the existence of a space where the personal and the public, the local and the foreign can coexist. Symposium: Disability incarcerated Monday, March 9 | 9:15 a.m.-8 p.m. | Booth Auditorium rm 175 Boalt Hall, School of Law This symposium brings together editors and other scholars, students, activists, and community members to map the intersections of policing, imprisonment, and the disabled body. The event seeks to step into the void within critiques of the “prison industrial complex” - namely the absence of discussion of disability oppression, despite the disproportionate representation of people with disabilities within prisons and gated institutions. The day of speakers, starting with Angela Davis and the three editors of Palgrave Macmillan’s Disability Incarcerated (2014), Liat-Ben Moshe, Allison Carey, and Chris Chapman, will also include two films, HEARD’s “Deaf in Prison” and Karen Nakamura’s “Bethel.” The Sins Invalid Performance Project will perform a new piece especially curated for this event, “Disability Liberated: Mourn the Dead and Fight Like Hell for the Living.” Lecture: Tarek Atoui, DeafSpace and making musical instruments Monday, March 9 | 7:30-9 p.m. | David Brower Center, 2150 Allston Way, Berkeley Atoui, an electro-acoustic musician who initiates and curates multidisciplinary interventions, events, concerts and workshops in Europe and the Middle East, will present several of his ongoing projects each of which propose original methods for making instruments and the possibilities they open in terms of collaboration, performance and composition. In the Dahlem Sessions and the Reverse Sessions, Atoui inverted the order in which instruments are usually created, using the sounds of a collection of ethnic musical instruments located in the Dahlem Museum of Ethnology in Berlin as a starting point for imagining and building new instruments. This project was first presented in the 2014 Berlin Biennial and expanded in a solo exhibition presented at kurimanzutto gallery in Mexico City. For his MATRIX project at BAM/PFA, Atoui will build on WITHIN, a project that he initiated in Sharjah (UAE) in 2013, which is based on a series of conversations and collaborations with students from a school for the deaf. Tickets: Free of charge Ticket info: Buy tickets online. Lecture: Frans de Waal on prosocial primates Monday, March 9 | 2:30-4 p.m. | Sibley Auditorium, Bechtel Engineering Center Frans de Waal, world-renowned primatologist and one of Discover magazine's "47 Great Minds of Science," is a pioneer in the study of the evolutionary basis of empathy and kindness. In this talk, he will explore the evolutionary roots of empathy and sympathy--and consider why this discovery has received relatively little attention. He'll consider two factors that might explain this lack of little attention. One is that evolutionary biology, until recently, preferred a "nature red in tooth and claw" view that had no place for kindness. The second has been an excessive fear of anthropomorphism and a taboo on the term "emotion" in relation to animals. Colloquium: Body burdens Monday, March 9 | 3:40-5 p.m. | 575 McCone Hall | Note change in date For the past half century, toxicologists and environmental activists have used the term “body burden” to describe the accumulated amount of harmful substances present in human bodies. In recent years, “charges corporelles” have emerged as part of the popular conversation in Martinique, a French territory in the Caribbean where Dr. Agard-Jones conducts ethnographic research. Chlordécone, a pesticide once used widely on the island’s banana plantations, has been identified as the source of rising levels of estrogen-like chemicals in the environment and its presence in contaminated soils and foods has been linked to both male infertility and prostate cancer. This talk will investigate the relationship of racialized and gendered bodies to their environments in Martinique and the effects of colonial violence. Dr. Agard-Jones will highlight the particular vulnerabilities, as well as the contradictory assemblages of power, that body burdens reveal in postslavery societies. Lecture: How Russian came to loathe the West Monday, March 9 | 12-1:30 p.m. | 270 Stephens Hall In the Soviet Union of the late 1980s opening up to the West looked like a natural path to prosperity and democracy. In post-Soviet Russia, the attempt to emulate western models has ended in public disappointment. The collapse of the Soviet empire left Russia in limbo: too large and ambitious to ever become a mere member of the European alliance, yet lacking the attraction to form a strong alliance of its own. The story of Russia's disillusionment with the West is inseparable from Russia’s struggle to build a post-communist nation. Vladimir Putin was no isolationist, but the West's power kept him apprehensive and its policies deepened his suspicions. The risk of losing Ukraine to the West pushed Putin to make a radical and reckless choice. Course: The rise and future of the food movement January 26 – April 27, 2015 every Monday with exceptions | 6:30-8:30 p.m. | Live streaming A UC Berkeley course with live streaming open to the public. The food system is multi-disciplinary and complex, involving agroecology, agronomy, anthropology, economics, nutrition, sociology, and the arts. In this course, experts on organic agriculture, school lunch reform, food safety, hunger and food security, farm bill reform, farm-to-school efforts, urban agriculture, food sovereignty, and local food economies will offer perspectives making the food system more sustainable and equitable. Instructor: Garrison Sposito; co-hosts: food writer Mark Bittma and poet Robert Hass. Exhibit: Berkeley's Ivory Tower, the Campanile at 100 February 16 – November 2, 2015 every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday & Saturday | Rowell Cases Bancroft Library Sather Tower, also known as the Campanile, looms large both as a physical structure and as the most widely recognized symbol of the Berkeley campus. This exhibition celebrates the centennial of the landmark through holdings from the University Archives and The Bancroft Library's manuscript and pictorial collections. Film: Wavemakers Tuesday, March 10 | 7-9 p.m. | PFA Theater While you may never have heard of the Ondes Martenot, you may have heard the evocative tones that emit from this unique electronic instrument. Its distinctive timbre has been heard on the sci-fi TV show Thunderbirds as well as feature films from Lawrence of Arabia to There Will Be Blood. Wavemakers tells the story of the French musician and educator Maurice Martenot, a telegraph operator during World War I, who was transfixed by the sounds emanating from radio vacuum tubes. He spent the rest of his life perfecting his ondes, an instrument that converts electricity into music, and one so mysterious that its secrets are still being unraveled. Tickets: $9.50 General Admission,  $5.50 BAM/PFA members and Cal students,  $6.50 UC Berkeley faculty and staff, non-UC Berkeley students, senior citizens (65 & over), disabled persons, and youth (17 & under) Film: Sunflower Occupation Tuesday, March 10 | 4-6 p.m. | 180 Doe Library This collection of films connects the work of ten directors and nine themes concerning the occupation of the Taiwan parliament by student activists in March 2014. They were protesting the passing of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA) by the Koumintang ruling party without sufficient review. After 24 days of occupation what did they change, and how were they changed by it? Open house: Osher Lifelong Learning Institute Tuesday, March 10 | 10 a.m.-12 p.m. | Freight and Salvage Coffeehouse, 2020 Addison St, Berkeley OLLI @Berkeley is a year-round learning community for adults over 50.

Exhibit: The Secret Language of Flowers January 27 – June 26, 2015 every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday | 11 a.m.-4 p.m. | Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life (2121 Allston Way) In 1984, The Magnes acquired a portfolio of botanical drawings by Shmuel (Samuel) Lerner, a Ukraine-born amateur artist from California. While Lerner’s biography and many details surrounding this work remain obscure, today his drawings open for us a unique window into the landscape, the history and the languages of Israel in the period immediately following the establishment of the State. The exhibition features a selection of 26 botanical drawings from 1949, complete with the author's annotations about plants, places, and language. Lecture: Congressman Barney Frank Wednesday, March 11 | 5:30-7:15 p.m. | Chevron Auditorium International House First elected to Congress in 1980, Barney Frank represented Massachusetts’s 4th District for 32 years. He is known as a superb legislator and a pragmatic politician whose sharp intellect and sense of humor has made him one of the most influential and colorful figures in Washington. While in Congress, Frank worked to adjust America’s spending priorities to reduce the deficit, provide less funding for the military and more for important quality of life needs at home. As chair of the House Financial Services Committee, he adopted sweeping financial regulations to prevent a recurrence of the financial crisis and was a key author of the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. RSVP recommended RSVP info: RSVP online, or or by emailing elise.marsh@berkeley.edu. Music: Hugh Masekela, trumpeter and vocalist, and Vusi Mahlasela, singer-songwriter Wednesday, March 11 | 8 p.m. | Zellerbach Hall Two South African musical ambassadors and freedom fighters, singer-songwriter Vusi Mahlasela and trumpeter/vocalist Hugh Masekela, join forces for a celebration of 20 years of democracy in their homeland, performing music of the anti-apartheid movement with a stellar backing band. For the first time, Mahlasela's warm, powerful voice meets Masekela's clarion trumpet in songs that are "optimistic and soulful, delivered with an intensity that captures the attention and embraces the heart" (Los Angeles Times).
