The accrediting board must be guided by this intent.” (From the 1940 Founding Agreement) Since 1975, The National Architectural Accrediting Board Conditions for Accreditation have emphasized self-assessment and student performance as central elements of the NAAB model. The Directors have maintained their commitment to both of these as core tenets of the NAAB’s criteria and procedures.
