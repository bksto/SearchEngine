These include: Second Baccalaureate: This option is for prospective students looking to further their undergraduate experience by obtaining a second baccalaureate degree. Limited Status: This option is for students who already have a bachelor’s degree who are interested in taking additional upper-division, undergraduate courses for professional development or preparation for graduate programs. UCSB Extension: This option is for members of the community wishing to take courses for their own enrichment. Second Baccalaureate UCSB accepts very few second baccalaureate degree candidates each year. Students seeking a second baccalaureate degree must apply for admission and be approved by the college or program for which they have applied. International students may not apply for a second baccalaureate degree at UCSB. Second baccalaureate students are not eligible for financial aid or on-campus housing. If you have specific questions about an academic program, consult with your intended major department or the UCSB Catalog. The College of Letters and Science and the College of Engineering do not accept second baccalaureate applications. Admission Eligibility and Selection Applicants to the College of Creative Studies are reviewed and selected on the basis of their competency and the quality of their work. Admission will be considered only if the new major is substantially different from previous studies and represents a legitimate change in educational interest. It is recommended that applicants have earned at least a 3.0 grade point average in any preliminary coursework taken in preparation for their second degree. For students who have earned their first undergraduate degree at a UC campus, the College of Creative Studies will consider general education requirements as satisfied. Otherwise, applicants seeking a second baccalaureate will have to satisfy the college's current general education requirements. The College of Creative Studies has a six quarter residency requirement.   Materials Required When applying for admission for a second baccalaureate degree, in addition to your personal statements, please write a brief statement of your objectives or reasons for taking additional undergraduate coursework. Please include your intentions regarding the number of quarters you believe necessary to complete your educational objective. All students admitted to UCSB for a second baccalaureate degree will be held to the four components of graduation requirements: unit requirements, major requirements, general education requirements and residency requirements. Additional Questions For questions regarding applying to UCSB as a second baccalaureate student, please contact the Office of Admissions at (805) 893-2881. Limited Status Students who already have a bachelor’s degree and who are interested in taking additional upper-division, undergraduate courses to prepare for graduate or professional programs may qualify for admission to "Limited Status." Limited status students are assessed regular fees and are required to carry a full-time course load of at least 12 quarter units. Students who wish to take fewer units may petition for permission within their college. Limited status students are not eligible for financial aid or for on-campus housing. If you have specific questions about an academic program, please consult the UCSB Catalog. Limited Status Eligibility and Selection At this time, only the College of Creative Studies will consider application for limited status in one of the college’s eight areas of study. In general, UCSB accepts very few limited status candidates. Students seeking limited status must apply for admission and be approved by the college. International students may not apply for limited status at UCSB. Both the Director of Admissions and the provost or dean of the college in which the student plans to enroll must approve applications for limited status. Students with limited status are restricted to enrolling in courses for their designated field of study. Limited status students may not enroll in graduate-level courses. Courses taken as a limited student can never be applied to a graduate degree program at UCSB. Materials Required When applying for admission for limited status, in addition to your personal statements, please write a brief statement of your objectives or reason for taking additional undergraduate course work. Please include your intentions regarding the number of quarters you believe necessary to complete your educational objective. Limited status is granted from the quarter in which the student first enrolls through the last quarter of the same academic year. Subsequent study on limited status requires a re-admission application through the Office of the Registrar. Additional Questions For additional questions regarding applying to UCSB as a limited status student, please contact the Office of Admissions at (805) 893-2881.
