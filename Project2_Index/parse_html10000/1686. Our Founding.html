Jasper Newton Field had a dream—a college for his city. With the devastating 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroying the location for a new Baptist university and the university in Los Angeles struggling financially, the Rev. Field urged the Redlands Board of Trade and his parishioners at the First Baptist Church of Redlands to persuade the American Baptist site committee to locate its new university in Redlands. After weeks of intense work, lobbying, personal visits, a gift of land donated by Baptist layman Karl C. Wells, and more than $50,000 from a city subscription drive, the Rev. Field achieved his “dream.” The University of Redlands was chartered on Nov. 25, 1907, and admitted its first 59 students in September 1909. More than 100 years old, the University of Redlands is much changed since its founding. Yet our commitment to educate not only the mind but also the heart has remained an integral component of our liberal arts mission.
