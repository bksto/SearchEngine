Local area school districts Cal Poly Pomona is committed to enhancing our students’ experiences, persistence and graduation rates. Studies consistently show that student engagement and learning occurs both in and out of the classroom (Astin, 1993). For out-of-classroom learning, the Residence Halls are one of the most important places for students to encounter and experience social and cultural development, civic engagement, citizenship and leadership (Astin, 1991). Learning outside of the classroom also occurs through participation in student organizations and involvement in recreational and educational events. Living on campus encourages engagement and provides ready access.
