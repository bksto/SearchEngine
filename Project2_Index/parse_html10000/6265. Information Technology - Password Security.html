Password & Passcode Policy CSU Fullerton has instituted a mandatory password/passcode reset period for all non-student accounts.  Passwords are to be changed every February, May and September regardless of last changed date.     Passcodes now required: Campus managed services, such as Outlook email, require that mobile devices be configured to use a passcode. Each device must be encrypted to assure compliance with CSU policy and audit requirements.  Mobile device setup to access the campus email system and/or Dropbox must be configure to support the use of passcodes.   During the month of February campus employees will have the opportunity to create a passcode if one has not already been configured. After February 28th IT will enforce a passcode. Any device using a passcode that was setup 120 days before March 1st will be prompted to create a new passcode.
