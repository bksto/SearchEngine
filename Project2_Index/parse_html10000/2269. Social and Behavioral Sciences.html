The School of Social and Behavioral Sciences serves a diverse student population and the community by providing a quality educational experience in the pursuit of a variety of educational goals: occupational certificates, associate degrees, and preparation for transfer status to four-year colleges and universities. Courses numbered 1-99 are transfer and baccalaureate degree level courses and are comparable to those offered in the first two years of a four year college or university. Check the course description in the catalog for the transfer options of each course. In addition to the traditional classroom setting with state-of-the-art technology, many of our general education offerings are available in a distance education format. Students considering this option should check their readiness for an online class by visiting the Distance Education website and taking the Are You Ready? quiz to help ensure a successful experience. All of the Social and Behavioral Science (SBS) programs offer an associate degree option. In addition, several programs offer occupational certificates which document a level of mastery assisting students to enter the workforce in their chosen profession. The Child Development and Education program can prepare students to apply for their Child Development Permits from the regulating state agency. Social and Behavioral Sciences also has responsibility for a state-of-the-art Child Development Center with pre-school services for children of students, staff, faculty and the community. The dean’s office supports each of its programs with faculty and staff dedicated to helping students fulfill their educational goals.
