The people and works highlighted in Distinctions are truly inspiring. The story telling in Distinctions is one way we share our successes publicly, as we follow St. Vincent’s (​slightly modified) directive: “It is not enough to do good; it must be done well…and you must tell everyone about it.”  Please help us spread the word about DePaul. ​​​​​​ For More Information Related Links Description Distinctions ​​1 E.
