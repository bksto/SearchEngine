Hire a CAS Student Part-Time Meet your tutoring, childcare, house-sitting, pet-sitting, clerical or other employment needs by hiring a College of Arts & Sciences student.  To post a part-time position, simply complete the Part-Time Off-Campus Job Posting Request Form.  Your posting will be confirmed by email and interested students will contact you as directed. Find a Student Intern Looking for a bright, highly motivated student to contribute positively to your organization?  Bulldogs for Life may post internship opportunities for other Bulldogs free of charge on the University of Redlands Online Career Center, where they will note in the upper right hand corner “employers click here” to get started. Please note that for both paid internships and those for academic credit, it is the employing organization’s responsibility to assume liability for interns working on their premises.  The University of Redlands cannot accept responsibility for student/intern liability during an internship.   Advertise a Full-Time Position One of the best ways to serve the university as a Bulldog for Life is to connect fellow Bulldogs with full-time job opportunities.  Employers may advertise full-time positions to soon-to-be graduates and/or alumni free of charge on the University of Redlands Online Career Center. Then, click in the upper right hand corner “employers click here” to get started. Informational sessions and on-campus interviews are other opportunities Bulldogs for Life can take advantage of to meet full-time hiring needs.  Employers interested in having a presence at the Redlands should send an email to cascareerservices@redlands.edu or sbcareerservices@redlands.edu, depending on the target audience.
