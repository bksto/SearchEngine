Title IV Consent Form Waiver of privacy rights for billing information form Computing Support PPS Organization Plan Equipment Management Asset Information Form The online Asset Information Update Form should be completed and submitted when new equipment is received, in order to provide Equipment Management with information that was not available when the Gateway Requisition was submitted.  The form should also be used any time that equipment is relocated, and during the physical inventory process to update information.  Data fields that may be updated include: Asset Description Manufacturer Name Model Number/Name Serial Number Building Number Room Number User Condition Click the following link - ASSET INFORMATION UPDATE FORM - to access the form.  When you have entered all relevant information (you can update just one field, or several), click the SUBMIT button at the bottom of the form in order to transmit it via email to Equipment Management. Helpful Hint: If departments update this information as equipment is received or relocated, there is MUCH LESS work to be done at the time of the Physical Inventory: no searching for serial numbers on the back of computers or other pieces of equipment; accurate location and user for each piece of equipment already printed on the Inventory, expediting physical verification of its location and status; less writing by the department on the Inventory. Equipment Inventory Modification Request (EIMR) Packet Instructions: The Equipment Inventory Modification Request (EIMR) form is used to process all types of modifications to the equipment inventory file except the disposal of excess and surplus property. Please use the Excess and Surplus Property Disposal (ESPD) form to dispose of property via pick-up by Central Stores. Fill in the four fields at the top of the form: Department Name Inventorial Custody Code Contact Phone   Check the box corresponding to the type of transaction being processed on the EIMR: Interdepartmental Transfer Destroyed (Cannibalized) Lost Off-Campus Use Fabrication Other NOTES: Only one type of transaction box may be selected per EIMR. "Other" transactions include: Interdepartmental Loan, Intercampus Loan, Intercampus Transfer, Theft, Recovery (of assets previously reported Lost or Stolen), Borrowed from a non-UC agency or individual, Termination of Borrowed Status, and Donation of Equipment. If applicable, enter any special circumstances, explanatory comments, etc. into the Remarks section. If the type of transaction is "Other," the Remarks section must be completed.   For each piece of equipment being processed, fill in the three fields in the Equipment Identification section: Property Number Description CATS Value The EIMR may be returned to the originating department if these fields are not completed. A printout from a department database may be substituted for the Equipment Identification section on the condition that it includes (at least) all three fields, with all information entered. If applicable, additional data should be entered into the following sections of the EIMR: Department Fabrication This section is used to record the completion of a Fabrication. Provide information in the four fields, if applicable: Labor Costs (machine shop, etc. labor charges have been incurred, if any) Materials & Supplies (materials and supplies purchased via Low Values or Purchase Orders, but not receiving inventorial property tags) Equipment Components (if the Fabrication includes any inventorial equipment items which have received separate property numbers and tags) Total Cost of Fabrication (the sum of a., b. and c.)   Loaned/Borrowed Equipment This section is used when equipment is: (A) loaned to (1) another department at UCSB, (2) a department at another UC campus, (3) a non-UC agency or organization, or (4) to a UCSB employee for off-campus use, whether at home or abroad for research. Please note that an off-campus use EIMR should only be prepared if the period of use will be at least 6 months. (B) borrowed from (1) another UC campus, or (2) a non-UC, agency or individual. Please note that Equipment Management must be notified, via an EIMR that references the original, of the termination of all cases of loaned or borrowed equipment. Transfer This section is used when equipment is permanently transferred from one UCSB department to another or to another UC campus (usually when a professor relocates) Print the Equipment Inventory Modification Request.   Have the appropriate department official sign the EIMR. Please note that in the case of a transfer or loan of equipment between departments, both departments must sign the EIMR before it is forwarded to Equipment Management. In the case of the loan or transfer of equipment between campuses, only the UCSB department needs to sign; Equipment Management will send it to the sister campus for signature, completion and eventual return to UCSB.   Send one original copy of the completed and signed EIMR (plus any attached printout and/or relevant documentation) to Equipment Management. Some departments have created their own versions of the EIMR, in programs such as Excel or Filemaker: these forms may continue to be used, on the condition that they are modified to include all the information fields on the new format (most importantly, the Transaction Type check boxes). Equipment Inventory Modification Request Form Excess and Surplus Property Disposal (ESPD) Packet Instructions: The Excess and Surplus Property Disposal (ESPD) form is used to dispose of excess and surplus property via pick-up by the Surplus unit of Central Stores, the department which manages the Campus Surplus Property Program. Fill in the four fields at the top of the form: Department Name Inventorial Custody Code(s) of item(s) Contact / Preparer Phone For each piece of equipment to be picked up, fill in the first four fields in the center section of the form: Property Number Description Does It Work? (Yes/No) UC Title? (Yes/No) If the piece of equipment contains a hard drive (for example, computers, servers, printers, or copiers), check the appropriate box in the next three fields of the center section of the form: Wiped – your department certifies that it has erased the hard drive Removed – your department certifies that it has removed the hard drive before pick-up Recycle – your department requests that the equipment be recycled (“shredded”) by a scrap dealer to ensure destruction of the hard drive The ESPD will be returned to the originating department if these seven fields are not completed, as appropriate, for all pieces of surplus equipment. Leave the next three fields blank: Equipment Management or Central Stores will complete them: NOI (Not on Inventory) Pick Up CATS A printout from a department database may be substituted for the central section of the ESPD on the condition that it includes all ten fields, with all requested information entered in the first four fields (and, if it contains a hard drive, in the next three fields) for each surplus item. If applicable, enter any special handling Notes (for example, the contact for pick-up and his/her extension). Print the Excess and Surplus Property Disposal form and have the appropriate department official sign it. Send the completed and signed ESPD (plus any attached printout) to Equipment Management. Do NOT send the ESPD directly to Central Stores: Equipment Management must review and approve the disposal transactions before Central Stores can take any action. Sending the ESPD form directly to Central Stores will delay pick-up of the surplus items.
