They become an active part of the diverse Los Angeles community. UCLA strengthens this relationship by offering opportunities for involvement and allowing students to earn credit for service learning — benefiting both students and the local community. Consistently ranked as one of the top universities for public service in the nation by Washington Monthly, UCLA offers students a breadth of volunteer opportunities.Through the Volunteer Center, UCLA students can get involved in numerous programs ranging from running children's events at the PADRES Contra El Cáncer's Annual Family Picnic to participating in one of the weekly food fundraisers on campus to cleaning up state parks, painting schools and just about anything that benefits the community. In addition to these programs, UCLA hosts Volunteer Day. This service event is the nation's largest service project for new students and brings together 8,000 UCLA volunteers annually.
