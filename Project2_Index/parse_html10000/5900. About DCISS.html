U.S. Derivative Visas Based on Same Sex Marriage On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is unconstitutional. Based on the Supreme Court ruling and the subsequent decisions made by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to recognize same-sex marriage as legal, the Dashew Center will accept requests for derivative visas (e.g.: F-2, J-2, H-4, etc.) based on same-sex marriages for persons who were married in countries or states that recognize same-sex marriage as legal. See DHS’s announcement. For Post-DOMA ‘Frequently Asked Questions’, click here. Recent Increase in Reported Fraud There has been a recent increase in reports of fraud involving individuals posing as immigration and tax officials requesting personal and bank information from non-residents in the U.S. Please remember that the Dashew Center, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. immigration officials will never request credit card, Social Security or banking information over the phone. Refer to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Federal Trade Commission websites for tips on how to avoid scams or to report any instances of fraud. Please report any instances of tax phishing to the IRS.
