Buggin' Out Have you ever seen an insectary or been to a museum devoted to bugs? UC Riverside is on the cutting edge of entomological research and our researchers are world-renowned in the field of biological control. So it's only fitting that we're also home to a $15 million, 28,000-square-foot, high-security Insectary & Quarantine Facility. It's the only one of its kind in the state and one of the most advanced university-based laboratories in the nation. Here, researchers study exotic pests, evaluate potential natural enemies, and develop genetically-engineered plants and insects. They're also developing ways to modify insects genetically to protect plants, and even humans, from dangerous diseases. Then there's also the Entomology Research Museum, which showcases UCR's large collection of insects and related arthropods - roughly 3 million specimens, placing it among the 25 largest insect collections in North America!
