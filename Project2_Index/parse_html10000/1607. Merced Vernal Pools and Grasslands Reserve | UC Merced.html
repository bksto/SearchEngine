Though the land has always been protected as part of the university, a vote by the UC Regents in 2014 made the UC Merced reserve an official member of the 750,000-acre UC Natural Reserve System. By joining the NRS, UC Merced’s campus reserve — the first in the Central Valley ± is now part of a network of 39 permanently-protected open spaces found across the length and breadth of California. The NRS’s protected wildland sites encompass many of California's major ecosystems. The reserves support university-level research and teaching, and are used by students, faculty members and other researchers to study natural systems, communities and ecological processes in these rich, diverse environments. In coming years, the reserve leaders plan to have an interpretive and educational center, guided tours and events and more. Keep up with the reserve online and explore the many reasons this land is so important.   The first new American research university in the 21st century, with a mission of research, teaching and service.
