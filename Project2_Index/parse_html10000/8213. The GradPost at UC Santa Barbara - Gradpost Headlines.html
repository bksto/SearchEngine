Photo courtesy of Zach Geiger.Meet Zach Geiger, a fourth year Experimental Physics Ph.D. candidate at UCSB. When he’s not working with lasers in the lab or chilling on Goleta beach, he can be found helping put the collective “wow” back into science for students in the local Santa Barbara area as part of the Physics Circus. Zach found his love for physics while growing up in Moorpark, California in Ventura County. He was fortunate to have been inspired by a great high school physics professor Craig Carlyle, a retired engineer, who liked to teach physics through demonstrations. In his class, Zach discovered the wonder of physics in action and not just as equations on paper. Zach later went to study at UC San Diego where he earned a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in Mathematics. Now he’s studying experimental physics at UCSB, using cool words like “quantum computation” to describe some of his work, and wowing kids with science as part of his other work in the Physics Circus. Tell me about your involvement with Physics Circus? The Physics Circus actually started 20 years ago. It was developed by a faculty member, Jean Carlson, and another grad student. Today, it’s taught as a class. They always need volunteers to help. So when I was a first year grad student I volunteered to work with the previous coordinator, Karina Roitman. When she left, she recommended me to take over the coordination position. I’ve been the coordinator for a year and a half now. I help set up events, manage volunteers, maintain demos, and teach physics concepts to children. Zach bringing the "wow" at the Physics Circus. Photo coutesy of Zach Geiger. Why did you get involved? I love seeing the spark go off in a child's mind. Something like levitating a racquet ball, shooting a ring with an electromagnet--it is visually striking. Kids don’t get to experience that in regular classroom settings. Whenever you do it correctly, you get a collective gasp from the audience. I really like when that happens. On some level you reach them and inspire them.  That sounds fun. What do you do in your own research? Zach Geiger relaxing with his meat smoker. Photo courtesy of Zach Geiger.My group (led by Dr. David Weld) uses lasers to trap atoms in order to answer questions fundamental to quantum mechanics. Things like nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, quantum mechanics of condensed matter systems, and quasicrystals. Some people call what we do quantum emulation. Basically, we’re building a quantum computer. Certain systems are beyond classical computation and simulation, so we recreate the physics of those systems in a system that is easier to study and understand. That sounds like a lot of work. What do you to relax? I like to go to the beach a lot. At Goleta beach, you can go to the beach with a beer or cocktail and just unwind. I also like to cook a lot.  But what I really like is BBQ. I built my own smoker. Making smoked meats is a lot of fun. It’s a passive experience, so it’s great to relax. You can smoke meats for 4-5 hours, and then you get to enjoy the tasty results. You’ve been a grad student for four years now. Any advice for people just starting out? At least in Physics, people tend to push themselves really hard. From my experience, I learned that grad school is a marathon, not a sprint. You can’t always be sprinting. The first year broke me in terms of my workload...the work I did for professors, teaching, and classes. You need to give up on being a perfectionist. For example, you can spend a lot of time reading and never try out anything in the lab. But you have take that advice with a grain of salt. As my professor also jokes, six months in the lab can save you an afternoon in the library. What are you proud of as a grad student? Zach Geiger in the lab he help to build with Physics students Kurt Fujiwara, Ruwan Senaratne, and Shankari Rajagopal. Photo courtesy of Zach Geiger.Building up our lab. Understanding how everything works in the lab. It’s personally gratifying. When I joined the lab in December 2011, it was the professor’s first year also. There was no lab. We had to build it from scratch. Before I arrived, our space used to be conference rooms. The only thing we had at the start was a box of computer parts. My first job was to build a computer. What is the one thing you hope to be doing 5 or 10 years out of graduate school? I still want to be working on interesting and challenging problems. I want not to be bored.  If I was working on fun and challenging problems ten years from now, I would be very happy. For more on the Physics Circus, read The Current article, "A New Kind of Circus."

That's the theme of the UCSB Center for Spatial Studies' annual Lightning Talks event, which took place last Wednesday, February 25, in the Mosher Alumni House. At the event, students, faculty, staff, and friends were challenged to give engaging and accessible 3-minute talks related to spatially flavored topics. Among the presenters were graduate students from Geography, Music, and Education, as well as one very fluffy Great Pyrenees dog (who, incidentally, is not a graduate student). Read on to find out more about what Chinese calligraphy, geo-linked soundscapes, and experimental game spaces have in common. (Click here to view the full program. All photo credits: Shawn Warner-Garcia.) Tommy Dickey, assisted by Hot Rod LinkinTommy Dickey (with Hot Rod Linkin) Professor and Secretary of the Navy/ Chief of Naval Operations Chair in Ocean Sciences Department of Geography "Polar Bears and Great Pyrenees Dogs: A Matter of Scale!" How similar are Great Pyrenees dogs and polar bears? They are both large, white, and fluffy. They can both run at top speeds of around 25 to 30 mph (meaning they could keep up with world-record-setter Usain Bolt who tops out at about 27 mph). And they both rival otters and red pandas in their ability to participate in painfully adorable viral videos. David Gordon Graduate Student Ph.D. in Music/M.S. in Media Arts and Technology "Linking Sound, Image, and Place" David Gordon loves to hike. So much so that he created the Open Spaces project, a work-in-progress that will consist of a series of five immersive, interactive audiovisual simulations that combine over 20,000 geo-linked photos to day-long audio recordings of the natural environments in which the photos were taken. Skona BrittainSkona Brittain Math Circle Leader SB Family School "More Than Four Colors" Skona Brittain told the story of King Guthrie, who had too many sons and not enough creative ideas on how to divide up his kingdom in socially equitable ways. The King’s consultation with the court wizard led to “the four color conjecture,” which maintained that any map in a plane can be colored using four colors in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same color. Yingjie Hu Ph.D. Candidate Department of Geography  "Metadata Harmonization in Spatial Data Infrastructures" How do you solve a problem like too much metadata? With smart technology, of course. Yingjie Hu has developed a learning machine program that is able to take an existing metadata classification system (such as the one used by Data.gov) in order to extrapolate and apply the same standards to other metadata imported into the system. This leads to better metadata harmonization in spatial data infrastructures. And when metadata is harmonized, everybody wins. Todd Bryan Senior Developer, Operation McClintock Marine Science Institute "Wedding Cake Geoprocessing for Web GIS" Todd Bryan has a lot in common with grad students: He likes things that are fast, free, and open-source. That’s why he is developing a web app that runs geo-spatial analysis for non-expert users on a platform that circumvents the expensive, unreliable, and slow ArcGIS server system. By creating a series of execution tiers that increase in capability, users can keep their analysis as close as possible to their data source. Amy Shadkamyan-Talamantes Environmental Health and Safety "UCSB Business Continuity" Amy Shadkamyan-Talamantes' mantra is simple: be prepared. In her work with UCSB’s Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S), she manages the risks to the university posed by adverse disruptive events (such as natural disasters) by developing contingency plans. To date, EH&S has developed 88 contingency plans and will roll out a large enhancement project by the end of 2015. As Amy summed up: Darth Vader didn’t have a contingency plan for the Death Star, and we all know how that turned out. Selena DalySelena Daly Fulbright Post-Doctoral Scholar Department of French and Italian "Mapping the Italian Avant-Garde: Futurism in Space and Time (1909-1944)" Futurism was kind of a big deal around the beginning of the 20th century. Begun in Italy and eventually spreading to over 40 countries worldwide, this avant-garde movement celebrated all aspects of advanced technology and urban modernity. Selena Daly wants to track the spatial propagation of futurism using geo-temporal data taken from letters, performances, exhibitions, and publications in order to better understand the growth and change of both the hubs and the peripheries of the movement. Bernard Comrie Professor  Department of Linguistics, UCSB and  Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (Leipzig) "Go West, Young Man: Consistency and Inconsistency  in Cognitive Representations of Cardinal Directions" If you plop Bernard Comrie down in a strange city and give him cardinal directions, he is pretty confident that he can find his way around. However, when he relocated from the eastern coast of England to the western coast of the United States, he realized that his auxiliary cognitive model of cardinal directions (which equated east as “toward the sea” and west as “away from the sea”) only caused confusion when trying to navigate the highways of Los Angeles. Keith ClarkeKeith C. Clarke Professor Department of Geography "Why is the U.S. not metric?" The United States is one of three countries that is not metric-compliant (the two others are Myanmar and Liberia). However, Keith Clarke argues that the U.S. is in fact metric, we are just in denial about it. The metric system is used in science, education, manufacturing, and the military, and even our more common measurement units of feet and yards are defined in terms of their metric counterparts. Keith is currently working to re-establish the U.S. Metric Board to supervise a voluntary transition to the metric system. Jeremy Douglass Assistant Professor  Department of English "Experimental Game Spaces:  Virtual Visions, Architectures, and Dimensions" Video games aren’t just for entertainment (or annoying your significant other). Many of the game spaces that users immerse themselves in are 3D virtual worlds that creatively manage players’ relationships to the in-game architecture. Jeremy Douglass is studying how experimental game spaces – especially those which create physical impossibilities – are offering new ways of imagining and relating to space and architecture. William YimWilliam F. Yim Independent Aviation Consultant "Chinese Calligraphy" Calligraphy is one of the highest forms of artistic expression in Chinese culture, and William Yim wants everyone to know about its beauty, complexity, and importance. In a poignant multimodal presentation, Yim explained about its history and prominent place in modern-day China. David A. Hallowell Doctoral Student  Gevirtz Graduate School of Education "First-Grade Students and Geometric Diagrams: What do they notice?" Every school year, grade-school children encounter 2D geometric diagrams on posters, worksheets, and textbooks. But what happens when you add 3D geometric shapes into the mix? That’s what David Hallowell wanted to know, so he interviewed 36 first-graders as they participated in a shape-matching task as part of his dissertation research. Not surprisingly, he found that context and structure matter a lot, and students often had trouble with how projected surfaces were represented on 3D objects when they had primarily been exposed to 2D diagrams. As a result, David recommends that teachers slow down conversations in geometry lessons in order to draw attention to less-noticed aspects of geometric shapes. Kim YasudaKim Yasuda Professor Department of Art, Spatial Studies "Light Works: Isla Vista" What do you think of when you think of Isla Vista? Kim Yasuda has three words: public research lab. When Kim moved from Santa Barbara to Isla Vista in 2004, she noticed several elements that have given the community its party-hard reputation: streets are poorly lit while liquor stores are well-lit, and staple items (such as eggs and milk) cost more and alcohol costs less compared to other parts of town. So she began the First Fridays project to bring art installations, performances, light works, live music, improvisation and dance to Isla Vista’s Perfect Park as a late-night alternative destination for Friday nights. Steve Miley GauchoSpace Lead College of Letters of Science "Beyond the Locked Gates" Locked gates are no deterrent for Steve Miley. He has been going beyond the locked gates of backcountry trails in California, using a geotracking device on his bicycle to track his explorations of hidden locales. By tracking his progress and coverage, he can get a big-picture (and bird's-eye) view of the different roads he has traveled. Videos from all of the Spatial Lightning Talks will be posted to the website in the near future!

Credit: George YatchisinA contingent of faculty, staff, and students from UC Santa Barbara’s Gevirtz School, along with teachers from its Harding University Partnership School, recently met with Santa Barbara Museum of Art Director of Education Patsy Hicks to discuss forging new educational partnerships. The group sat in the museum’s Family Resource Center interactive educational space currently designed around the theme “Where Art Meets Science” to discuss just that – how the museum could be a lab for the furthering of STEM education, teacher preparation, and educational research. “The museum sees this meeting as just the first step in a process of discovery,” Hicks says. “While we already have a host of educator events and workshops and student programs, we are always looking for ways to expand our impact in the community. Connecting with the Gevirtz School seems an avenue for even greater reach.” This meeting featured artist-in-residence Alejandro Cartagena from Monterrey, Mexico. Cartagena showed some photographs from his serial series Car Poolers, and discussed educational assignments he developed for San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Hicks suggested Gevirtz School students and researchers could work with artists such as Cartagena as just one advantage of a SBMA-GGSE partnership. Beyond that, Hicks was receptive to numerous types of collaboration, even mentioning that graduate students could come in and design a “program” in the Family Resource Center interactive educational space, a hands-on way to turn theories of education into action. “We couldn’t be more pleased to have this opportunity to work with the Santa Barbara Museum of Art,” says Lilly Garcia, Director of STEM Outreach at the Gevirtz School. “Their existing education programs are so robust – from lesson plans to outreach programs, from English Language Learner Focus Tours to creating ways to use art to address the new Common Core standards – that we know this partnership will benefit our students in immeasurable ways.” Editor’s Note: This article is republished with permission from the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education.

Jessica is a student of the UC system, having finished her BA in cognitive science at UC San Diego in 2007, and her MA in counseling psychology at UC Santa Barbara in 2012. Now a doctoral candidate working through her predoctoral clinical internship at Rady Children’s Hospital through the UCSB/VA Internship Program, Jessica plans to use the knowledge learned pursuing her Clinical Counseling and School Psychology degree to better understand the subtle signs of autism in young children. Where did you grow up? I was born in Orange County but grew up in Corona, California (repping the IE!). I have spent most of my life in Southern California, aside from a brief East Coast tour I did for three years before graduate school. After undergrad I moved to Connecticut to do research at the Yale Child Study Center. It was a great experience and I encourage all Californians to get a taste of something different before settling in the best state in the country (California, of course). Tell us a little about your research and how you came to choose the topic. My research aims to identify discernable behavioral characteristics of autism spectrum disorder and map the corresponding neurological mechanisms at the earliest possible age. [In 2013, Jessica was among a UCSB contingent that traveled to Sacramento to meet with state legislators to discuss the value and impact of UC research.] Autism spectrum disorder is a social disability that is typically diagnosed between 3 and 5 years of age, yet behavioral intervention techniques for infants as young as six months of age have been suggested. Early behavioral intervention, and correspondingly early identification, is critical for optimal outcome. The first step in understanding developmental psychopathology is to map a particular behavioral or neurological construct in typical development. Stemming from this perspective, my dissertation investigated clinical correlates of social smiling in 6- to 9-month-old typically developing infants. Another aspect of my research is early intervention. In collaboration with Dr. Lynn Koegel and the Koegel Autism Center, we have investigated the use of Pivotal Response Treatment for infants exhibiting symptoms of autism spectrum disorder as young as six months of age.Jessica, center, with advisors and fellow graduate students at the APA conference in Hawaii. The development of autism spectrum disorder in the infant and toddler period has been an interest of mine since my undergraduate work at UCSD. My interests stem from a general interest in developmental psychology, cognitive science, and social neuroscience, as well as a keen appreciation of clinical psychological and the necessity to translate basic science findings for clinical use in diagnostics and intervention. It is a fascinating venture to pinpoint symptoms of ASD years before the hallmark symptoms of the disorder appear. What has graduate student life been like for you? Any graduate student will attest to the fact that grad school is a rocky ride. In clinical psychology the journey is also personal. We have to watch ourselves do psychotherapy on film in front of a group of other students and our supervisor – learning can’t get more terrifying than that! I was fortunate enough to receive a predoctoral fellowship from the Autism Science Foundation, which helped set the stage for my own independent research. This fellowship allowed me to focus on my research without having to TA or work on other projects. What do you like most about grad school and what do you like least? Relationships. The personal and professional relationships I have built with friends and colleagues have been invaluable to my graduate experience. I would not have made it through graduate school without my friends and family. My cohort has been there for me in personal crises, and our discussions have helped me grow as a researcher. I have also so enjoyed collaborating with other graduate students and labs on research. Psychology is much more collaborative than some other fields and intellectual discussion, collaborative projects, and cross-disciplinary ventures have been a huge part of my professional development. I always say that clinical psychology is like doing two graduate programs. One minute I am coding infant smiling frame-by-frame in the lab, the next I am doing therapy in juvenile hall with adolescents struggling with gang involvement and drugs. Although I love both clinical work and research, it can be exhausting! Jessica, left, enjoys a summer concert with two of her fellow grad students.What has been a source of motivation or drive for you in your graduate studies? My motivation is twofold. First, helping the families. The stress of some families with children with ASD and other special needs is unimaginable. The overarching goal of my research is to improve quality of life for everyone affected by autism. Second, I have always been motivated to learn more in order to answer the important questions. Actually, even coming up with the important questions can be a challenge. Who are your heroes and/or mentors and why? I have learned so much from all of my mentors: Fred Shic and Kasia Chawarska at Yale, and Bob and Lynn Koegel at UCSB. Fred and Kasia took a chance on me when they let me enter the world of autism research as a young, naïve student fresh out of undergrad. I still have not stopped learning from them. My graduate advisors, Bob and Lynn, trusted my research ideas and supported me, both personally and professionally, to the end. Name an accomplishment you are most proud of and why. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I think I am most proud of the services I have been able to provide for families and the local community. As a clinical researcher, the majority of my work has been interacting with parents of infants and toddlers. I am proud of each thank you letter and holiday card I receive from my families.   Jessica, left, loves to travel with friends to conferences in places like Madrid, Spain. What do you do to relax? Any hobbies, collections, pastimes, favorite places to go, favorite things to do? Good food and good beer are guaranteed to put a smile on my face. Live music and records are my favorite hobbies. Rock climbing used to be a big part of my life and is something I am always trying to do more of. What do you hope to be doing 5 or 10 years out of graduate school? I hope to be on faculty somewhere continuing autism research, but that’s a boring answer. How about…I hope to be making enough money to go to as many concerts as I want, to taste as much local beer as I can, and to have a really cute dog (preferably a pug). Do you have any advice for current grad students? Complain less! Venting can be therapeutic, but also toxic. So vent as you need to, but too much negativity can be counterproductive.  Post a Comment | Share Article Email Article Print Article tagged UCSB grad students, graduate student spotlight, graduate students, historical, jessica bradshaw | in Grad Student Spotlight, Profiles Friday Feb132015 A Valentine from the GradPost to You: Happy Doodle Day! Tweet By Patricia Marroquin, Communications Director Friday, February 13, 2015 at 5:00AM Credit: Lisa Slavid, PeadoodlesLisa Slavid says she has “always doodled in the margins of everything.” So when we requested her doodles for the pages of the GradPost as a Valentine’s Day gift to our graduate students, she was only too happy to oblige. Slavid is the Coordinator of Organizational and Performance Management for Housing & Residential Services at UCSB. Her role involves strategic planning, leadership development, and best-practices research. She has worked in the field of Student Affairs and Housing & Residential Services at UCSB for two decades in a variety of roles, including Resident Director, Student Leadership Coordinator, and Coordinator of Strategic Initiatives. Her passion, she says, is to help people and organizations reach their highest potential. This Student Affairs professional holds a bachelor’s degree from Smith College (art, with a focus on oil painting and photography, was one of her majors there) and a master’s degree in Counseling from Santa Clara University. Slavid has also been a Semester at Sea sailor. She has traveled as a member of the staff on three academic voyages, twice as Dean of Students, and she sits on Semester at Sea’s board of trustees. A Peadoodle created especially for UCSB graduate students by Lisa Slavid.While doodling has always been a part of her life, it was about five years ago that “the doodles wanted to be drawn front and center, and the ‘Peadoodles’ just started coming,” she said. At first, Slavid’s whimsical creations were centered on puns about food. Now her artwork has been extended to include animals and inanimate objects. In a 2012 interview with Semester at Sea, she talked about the hundreds of Peadoodles she has drawn. “Even in simplicity, there is a lot of complexity with these little guys,” she said. “I keep them sweet, positive, and mostly innocent,” Slavid told the GradPost, “and I love that people send me suggestions as well.” Our suggestion for a (Pea)h.D.-related Peadoodle produced the one you see here, a labor of love from Slavid to UCSB graduate students. Some previously drawn Peadoodles with words of love and encouragement are also shown here. You can enjoy more of Slavid’s “Peadoodles” at the Peadoodles Facebook page and on the Peadoodles blog. Semester at Sea also published a Q&A with Dean Slavid. Happy Doodle Day, er, Happy Valentine’s Day to everyone from the GradPost … and from Lisa Slavid’s Peadoodles!

In this installment, three members of our faculty panel answer your questions about the academic publishing process, including how much you should publish as a grad student and how to deal with the rigors of peer review. About Our Faculty Panel Richard ChurchDr. Richard Church is a Professor of Geography. He holds a Ph.D. in Environmental Systems Engineering from The Johns Hopkins University and has published over 180 papers and research reports in a variety of fields. He specializes in the analysis of problems defined over space and time, including logistics and transportation, location theory, water resource, urban and environmental systems.   John MajewskiDr. John Majewski is the Interim Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts as well as a Professor of History. He holds a Ph.D. in American History from UCLA. His areas of specialization include American economic, social, and legal history, Southern history, and the U.S. Civil War. Dr. Majewski is the author of two books as well as numerous articles, reviews, and book chapters. He also regularly reviews manuscripts for various journals and university presses. He earned the UCSB Academic Senate Distinguished Teaching Award in 2003.   Leila RuppDr. Leila Rupp is the Associate Dean of Social Sciences and Professor of Feminist Studies. She holds a Ph.D. in Modern European and Modern American History from Bryn Mawr College. She specializes in women’s movements, sexualities, and transnational history. Dr. Rupp has authored or co-authored half a dozen books and published numerous articles, book chapters, and other essays. She served as editor for the Journal of Women’s History and continues to serve on the editorial board for several journals. She earned the UCSB Academic Senate Distinguished Teaching Award in 2008 and is currently serving as the Graduate Advisor for the Department of Feminist Studies.   Q: What is the ideal publishing timeline for a graduate student? Dr. Majewski: I am most familiar with the humanities and social sciences, and in those disciplines, the most likely time to begin publishing is after completion of the Ph.D. qualifying exams. Students who have taken their exams have mastered key works in their field, know the questions they want to pursue, and have begun to embark on dissertation research and writing. Publishing is especially helpful at the dissertation stage because you will get useful feedback and establish a sense of engagement with scholars in your field. It will become clearer to you what arguments other scholars find compelling, and what arguments need more work. Publishing at the dissertation stage also helps you establish a scholarly identity. You are essentially alerting others in your field about the questions you find compelling. Dr. Rupp: The answer to this question varies tremendously depending on discipline: whether the discipline values books vs. articles, how much and what kind of research is necessary to publish, whether one publishes alone or with an advisor, and so on. I will start by saying the obvious: you have to have something worth publishing first, so do not feel pressured to publish until that is the case. Once something is in print under your name, it is there forever. For the rest, I will answer based on my experience in the fields of history and feminist studies. A first publication can be based on an M.A. thesis, or it can be a first product of dissertation research. I have always encouraged my graduate students to publish their M.A. theses in some form. In my department, the M.A. thesis is designed to become an article: it is roughly 30 pages and is based on original research. It has none of the extended literature review or discussion of methodology found in an unrevised thesis or dissertation. I also encourage my students to think of some part of the dissertation that can be published as a article before completing the dissertation. This announces to the world (or, more realistically, scholars interested in your field) that you are working on this topic. So, an article early on (but not too early) and at least one on the dissertation topic pre-defense is, in my opinion, ideal. Dr. Church: There is no one answer that fits all of the circumstances that come to mind in a publishing timeline. The answer to this will vary significantly across disciplines as well as what type of job a graduate student intends to seek after graduation. For example, in the humanities, the notable accomplishment is the development of a dissertation and the possibility of transitioning this to a book. However, in the sciences, individuals often need to develop a sizable number of published papers as a graduate student or maybe while doing a post-doc if they are seeking a university post. In fact, the dissertation in the sciences is often arranged in such a manner that it is comprised of chapters that are stand-alone papers that have been submitted for review. Universities look closely at the publication record when selecting possible candidates, while private corporations look more at courses, research results, etc. Since the real answer to this is discipline-specific and job-specific, I would recommend that a graduate student talk to their advisor, their department’s graduate advisor, and their committee members as to a potential target number of publications and a timeline.    Q: How does one deal with the peer review process, including rejection and critical feedback? Dr. Rupp: First of all, think of the review process as an incredible privilege: scholars outside your committee are reading your work, taking it seriously, and suggesting ways to improve it. No matter how long we’ve been publishing, we tend to have a cycle of reactions to critical peer reviews. At first reading, there’s a certain amount of outrage and denial. So it’s good to put the reviews aside after reading them, think about them, and come back to them in a few days. Let your advisor and other committee members read the reviews and ask for their reactions. Then sit down and outline what you agree with and what you do not. Give yourself plenty of time to revise, assuming you have the opportunity to revise and resubmit. Take everything seriously, and write a very careful memo describing what you have done and what you have not done and why. This is critical and is almost as important as the revisions themselves. If your article is rejected, do not give up. Some of the best articles have been rejected by more than one journal. Take the comments to heart, revise, and send somewhere else. I repeat, do not give up unless your advisor thinks it is hopeless. If you start early enough, you can begin with the best journal that is appropriate and move down from there. I just received an email from one of my students who received her Ph.D. in the spring. Her article based on her M.A. thesis was finally accepted after more than one rejection (and many revisions) over the last 5 or 6 years. Dr. Church: Never take a critical review personally. Life is too short to harbor such feelings. Almost everyone has received a note indicating that their paper has been rejected or needs major revision. Early in my career, I experienced a reviewer who wrote that my paper was a complete waste. Another reviewer gave me a half thumbs-up for the same paper, but wrote that I needed to make some revisions. The editor was more inclined to side with the first reviewer and to reject the paper. I modestly revised this manuscript and resubmitted it with a long explanation as to why it needed a second look. It was accepted, and not long after it was published someone wrote me and told me it was one of the best papers on the subject they had read. The take-away here is that reviews are not always accurate, but often have good suggestions as to how the paper can be improved. They can also raise concerns that you hadn’t addressed in the paper and a revision gives you the opportunity to correct this omission. This often results in a clear pathway to a published paper when such issues are addressed. If I had taken criticism personally, perhaps I wouldn’t have revised and resubmitted. If you experience a negative review, I recommend that after reading it, you set it aside for a few days. Picking it up a few days later, you might look at the review from a more objective viewpoint, rather than taking it personally. Dr. Majewski: Rejection goes hand and hand with publishing. The more prestigious and established a journal, the greater the chance of rejection. (Not getting rejected, in fact, may be a problem as it might be a sign that you are not taking enough risks.) Let’s face it, rejection stings. After all the hard work and creative energy that goes into an original piece of scholarship, it is hard to see it criticized and rejected. Don't lose confidence and don't get defensive. Remember that everybody has faced rejection at one time or another, so carefully listen to criticism, and use it to improve your work. Most reviewers will give you honest feedback, while a few reviewers will be biased, ideological, or other variants of unfair. Even if you believe a review is unfair, it is important not to take it personally, and try to find a nugget or two of good advice. And remember, there are always other journals, other outlets, and other reviewers. Q: In order to get a good academic job, how much do I need to publish by the time I graduate? Dr. Majewski: There is no one publishing formula for the job market. I have seen superb job candidates with multiple publications as graduate students, and I have also seen superb candidates with only a publication or two. In traditional book disciplines, a brilliantly conceived dissertation will likely count far more than articles, while in the sciences and social sciences, publishing early and often in journals is a marker of success. One strategy that often works is to have one really good “flagship” article placed in a strong journal. That article can demonstrate the importance of your research agenda and can be the basis of your job talks and elevator speeches for the job market. In general, it is better to publish fewer high-quality pieces than to have a profusion of lower-quality articles that don’t quite have the same scholarly impact. Dr. Rupp: It is not really a question of how much. How much is enough varies by discipline, but in every discipline a book is not just a book and an article is not just an article. The quality of your work and the quality of the venue makes an enormous amount of difference. Some publication is increasingly essential in every field. The goal I set for my students, as noted above, is at least one article, preferably in a well-ranked journal in the field, based on the dissertation research, and one other based on other work (MA thesis, seminar paper). One thing to keep in mind in book disciplines is that publishers do not want you to have published too many articles based on the dissertation, since then they worry that no one will buy the book. So it is possible to publish too much as a graduate student. When looking at a book manuscript, editors will want to know how chapters differ from articles you have published. If you want and need to publish a book, keep this in mind. And don’t forget, an article in the top journal in your field has the potential to get you farther than a long list of publications (such as encyclopedia entries, book reviews) that, at some universities, are considered more “service” than scholarship. I encourage my students to think of the dissertation as a first draft of a book manuscript, and I have had students publish books with relatively minor revision. In disciplines and at universities that require a book for tenure, hiring committees will want to be able to see that a book is within reach before the tenure clock runs out. Dr. Church: There is no fixed number in most professions. There are a number of factors that are often considered: quality of journals, the fit of the journals within your field, impact factors, numbers of papers, etc. For example, to many people, an article in Science, or Nature trumps several articles in other journals. Having half a dozen articles published and several underway is a good first start in many professions. It is best to discuss this with your advisor. One last note, things have changed considerably, where 30 years ago many people started an academic job with one or two papers; now, the needed number in most fields in getting an academic appointment is 4 to 5 times this amount or even more if a post doc is the norm. This trend is likely to continue. Got a question for our expert advisors? Email Shawn Warner-Garcia, Graduate Division’s Professional Development Peer, to submit your query.

The status is a recognition that at least 25% of the student body are Latinos. While three other UC campuses – Merced, Santa Cruz, and Riverside – already hold that designation, UCSB becomes the only HSI that is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), an elite group of 62 leading research universities in the U.S. and Canada. As an HSI, the university is now eligible to compete for grants and funding for various initiatives, including the acquisition of lab and scientific equipment for teaching; development of faculty; and support services for all students. Education Ph.D. student Priscilla Pereschica is doing her dissertation research on Hispanic-Serving Institutions.One UCSB graduate student who was happy to hear this news is Priscilla Pereschica, a fourth-year doctoral student in the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education whose emphasis is Educational Leadership and Organizations. The GradPost featured Priscilla in a Graduate Student in the Spotlight column in October 2014. Priscilla, who also works on campus as a Conduct Officer in the Office of Judicial Affairs, grew up in the Central San Joaquin Valley. “As a first-generation college student, I faced barriers, lacked the appropriate knowledge and capital, and often navigated the process alone,” Priscilla told the GradPost. “My experiences influenced my research interests, and I wanted to understand how to increase degree completion rates for students of color and how institutions can best serve their underrepresented populations.” Those dissertation research interests focus on Hispanic-Serving Institutions. “I got involved in HSI research through my former advisor, Patricia Marin. We are working on a research project that examines the perspectives of graduate students as their institution transforms into a Hispanic-Serving Institution,” she said. “For example, we sought to understand if this transformation has any meaning to them and if they thought that graduate students should have a role in this process. What’s interesting about our research is that the HSI definition is only contingent on the undergraduate student population, yet many of our graduate student participants believed that they could and should have a role in this process since they interact with undergraduate students in a number of capacities.” "I want people to know that the Hispanic-Serving Institution status will benefit all students, and not just Latino students. This HSI status also means that UCSB is becoming a bit more diverse and accessible, and I look forward to seeing the continued growth of UCSB’s diversity." – Education Ph.D. student Priscilla Pereschica There are several reasons Priscilla is both proud and excited that UC Santa Barbara has become an HSI. “First, as a Latina, I believe this milestone highlights the fact that my community is enrolling in college at an increasing rate and, on top of that, we have an increasing number of Latinos enrolled in this top-tier research university," she said. "It’s not enough to just enroll more Latino students. We have to truly serve them and ensure that they are completing their degrees by providing the appropriate support and resources. It will be interesting to see how the university will transition with its new status and how our campus community will embrace it. I want people to know that the HSI status will benefit all students, and not just Latino students. This HSI status also means that UCSB is becoming a bit more diverse and accessible, and I look forward to seeing the continued growth of UCSB’s diversity. Another important piece of this milestone is that UCSB is the first member of the Association of American Universities, which is a select group of the top-tiered research universities, to become an HSI. The majority of HSIs are state colleges and community colleges, so UCSB is changing the landscape of what HSIs have historically been.” Graduate Division Dean Carol Genetti agrees with Priscilla that this designation ultimately is a benefit for all. “It is exciting to know that more and more students of Chicano/Latino backgrounds are gaining access to UCSB's cutting-edge research and faculty,” Dean Genetti said. “This will allow us to prepare many more students for graduate school and beyond, so we can develop all that untapped talent, diversify our perspectives, and increase Chicano/Latino impact on the state, the nation, and the world.” For more information, read the Office of Public Affairs and Communications news release and a Los Angeles Times article.
