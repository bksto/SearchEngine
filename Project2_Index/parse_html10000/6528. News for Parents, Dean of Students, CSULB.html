Campus Updates If you’ve visited the CSULB website recently, you may have noticed a change. On Wednesday, February 18, CSULB launched their new website. The new layout is easy to navigate which better serves CSULB students and the larger community. During an interview with the Long Beach Post, Andy Hoang, Associate Vice President of University Relations & Communications, stated that “We have approximately 35,000 students and these students need to access email, or they need to access class schedules, and if they can't navigate and get to that information quickly, then we're not serving our students, we're not doing our job well.” The new homepage immediately opens up with videos highlighting different parts of CSULB such as the Shark Lab, Blair Field, and CSULB’s new Declare Campaign. An important aspect of the new site and one of the main goals is for the site to be viewable on almost any device, anything from mobile devices to tablets to desktop screens. As such, the new CSULB website will be accessible to anyone on any device. Perhaps the most important aspect of the site is that it was created by the CSULB community. Rather than hiring an outside agency to design the site, the website was created by our own community with input from faculty, staff, students and alumni. Furthermore, the new site highlights various aspects of the university that is not limited to just CSULB students such as the Japanese Garden or performances at the Carpenter Center. Thus, the website serves as a bridge between the university and the surrounding communities. If you haven’t had the chance yet, come visit our new CSULB website and explore all the things that make CSULB a world class institution.
