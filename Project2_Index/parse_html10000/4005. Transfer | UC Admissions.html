For many students who want to stay close to home or save money, community college can be a good way to get ready for a UC degree. In fact, nearly one in three UC students start at community college before graduating from a UC campus. How did they do it? By knowing UC is possible. Preparing for transfer is about getting ready to succeed at UC. It's about making the right choices for you, based on your major and the campus you hope to attend. We want you here Once you're ready to make the transition to UC, our doors are open. We give California community college students first priority over other transfer applicants, and many campuses offer guaranteed admission for well-prepared transfer students. Why? We know that transfer students add to the fabric of our UC community and arrive at our campuses with a diversity of interests and backgrounds and the intellectual passion to graduate and succeed.

You're a transfer student if you enrolled in a regular session (fall, winter or spring) at a college or university after high school. (Taking a class or two during the summer term immediately following high school graduation doesn’t make you a transfer student.)
