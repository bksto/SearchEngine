Since the inception of the program, nearly 100 University employees have stepped forward to champion the work of the chambers by attending mixers, networking events, luncheons, and installation galas and, in some instances, by participating in committee work or serving on boards of directors. Each partner chamber has an assigned lead, a “champion,” supported by a team of volunteers, most of whom reside in the chamber’s community.
