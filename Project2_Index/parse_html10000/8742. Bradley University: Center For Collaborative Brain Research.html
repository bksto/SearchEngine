Recent advanced technology in neuroimaging such as Magnet Resonance Imaging has brought the understanding and diagnostic capabilities into a new ear. However, this kind of facility is costly to establish and maintain. In downtown Peoria, Illinois, within a mile geographically of each other, there are two higher education institutions who have engaged heavily in brain related clinical diagnosis, treatment and research: OSF Saint Francis Medical Center and Bradley University. OSF Saint Francis Medical Center is a level one trauma center in central Illinois.  The Illinois Neurological Institute of OSF Saint Francis Medical Center is well known for its academic research and clinical treatment in brain related illnesses.  The Functional MRI program in Radiology has been established since 2001.  It is equipped with a cutting edge 1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla facility capable of real time fMRI data acquisition and viewing human brain function mapping simultaneously. US News & World Report has rated Bradley University one of the best midwestern universities for 2010.  Within Bradley University are many strong departments with faculty focused on special interests in brain research. In 2009, a collaborative brain research center was established between these major institutions to increase the communication of academia, research and clinical needs.  By sharing the combined resources, clinical treatment will be greatly improved, academic research will be elevated significantly, and the Peoria community can benefit economically. Participating as a research collaborator is the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria.  The University of Illinois College of Medicine has assisted the people of Illinois since 1859.  Today UICOMP physicians receive most of the area's NIH research grants. It is the goal of the Center for Collaborative Brain Research (CCBR) to establish a fast network between all these interested institutions and researchers to elevate the support of clinical diagnosis and treatment by improving the current academic research.  This network provides researchers from each institution opportunities to easily work with other researchers who have common interests yet different specialties. With more vigorous contacts between institutions and basic sciences, the CCBR provides a more effective research environment creating first class research for the Peoria and surrounding areas. © 2015 Bradley University | 1501 W Bradley Ave | Peoria, IL 61625 | (309) 676-7611 Accessibility | Disclaimer | Non-Discrimination Statement | Consumer Information
