Students live and work in close proximity to the Acadia National Park and numerous research, historical, environmental, and arts organizations. Students stay in cottages on the College of the Atlantic (COA) campus. In addition to traditional dorm living amenities, students have in-house kitchens, optional meal plans, and campus security. While similarities to college living are noticeable, the resemblance quickly disappears. Nestled on the east side of Mt. Desert Island, the rocky coast, mountainous terrain, and ocean vistas of the area have long been the destination of researchers, explorers, scientists, artists, and curious visitors. In addition to the academic and scholarly experiences that await WPI students, the summer in Bar Harbor offers the lure of hiking, biking, rock climbing, swimming, sailing, nature walking, kayaking, whale watching, and more. Projects Bar Harbor Projects have a strong focus on the relationship between the humanities, technology, the arts, and the environment. Projects involve research and creative activities intended to offer insight into the preservation, improvement, appreciation, and sustainability of the natural environment. Project Examples Dark Sky – Measuring and analyzing light pollution in the Acadia National Park. Trail View – Creating 360 degree interactive panoramic views of the 125 miles of hiking trails in the Acadia National Park. Sound Archive – Surround sound recordings of the natural environment in the Acadia National Park.   NOTE: E term programs are not eligible for financial aid.  Students participating in these programs are billed for tuition, housing and other program related fees.  Please carefully review the costs associated with these programs as you consider applying for them.   This program is currently not accepting applications.    Output:    PDF    HTML  Orientation:    Portrait    Landscape Share This Program Share brochure link:
