We attracted highly qualified applicant pools for both freshmen and transfer students. Yet again, we broke records for numbers of applications—receiving 84,388 undergraduate applications. Freshman applications increased slightly to 57,317, and transfer applications increased more than 4% to 27,071. Our freshman class remains almost identical to the Fall 13 cohort. We enrolled 4,335 freshmen—72% of them are eligible to take general-education level math and English, a 2% increase from Fall 13. Thanks to improved budgets, responsive enrollment planning and effective academic advising, we were able to provide our freshmen with full and appropriate schedules. Their average unit load remains high at 13.86. This fall, we intentionally enrolled a larger transfer class as the pool of fully qualified applicants was incredibly rich. 89% or our new transfers were fully qualified meeting all of our major-specific requirements. From this well-qualified pool, we enrolled 3,833 transfer students—an almost 17% increase. Again, thanks to excellent enrollment planning and effective academic advising, we were able to provide our transfer students with full and appropriate schedules, pushing up their average unit load slightly to 12.43. Our average unit load for continuing students remains high at 12.71 for the second year in a row. Changes in how we implemented the unit limits at registration helped ensure access to courses for new students without diminishing the average unit load of continuing students. Continuing students continue to register for up to 14 units at their first round of registration and may increase to 18 units during their second round. While we continue to work hard to address our few remaining bottleneck courses, students reported few issues with access to healthy schedules and courses. Students are also reporting great satisfaction with the class schedule planner that we implemented last spring as part of our eAdvising initiative. The tool allows students to more easily build full schedules that balance their educational and life demands. New graduate and post-baccalaureate students decreased by 9.5% to 1889. Non-resident students (primarily international students) decreased as well. We intentionally reduced the number of new international freshmen to allow us to better meet our more stringent STEM criteria. Overall, we have 1,222 additional students on campus this fall for a total of 36,808, a 3.4% increase. This makes Fall 14 our second largest Fall. We remain acutely sensitive to issues surrounding enrollment growth. In a recent Wednesday Message, Provost David Dowell addressed the issue of growth and encouraged the CSULB community to contact him with comments and thoughts. Spring 2015 Plans We will again experience a typical spring admissions cycle and are open for graduate, post-baccalaureate and transfer applicants in most majors. The Spring 2015 transfer application pool was much richer that the Spring 2014 pool—many of our majors have very healthy pools of fully qualified transfer students. We anticipate welcoming approximately 1300 new transfer students in Spring 2015, as well as approximately 500 new graduate students. We anticipate that Spring 15 FTES will be up approximately 3% from Spring 14. College FTES targets will be posted the first week in November. We continue to alter slightly our method to incorporate differences in college trends. Our enrollment priorities remain unchanged and we remain focused on student success. Nothing is more central to our mission than ensuring that we provide the classes students need to graduate. We encourage enrollment managers and chairs to aim for fill rates in the 85-95% range. Lower fill rates, especially in multi-section courses, suggest that efficiency could be improved while higher rates indicate needs are not being met adequately. We encourage enrollment managers and chairs to review class schedules, monitor enrollment and wait lists, adjust accordingly and respond to needs throughout the Spring 2015 registration period: Date Spring 2015 Registration Period 1-Oct-14 Spring 2015 Advising begins 3-Oct-14 Spring 2015 class scheduling ends 9-Oct-14 Degree Planner goes live for 26 majors! 13-Oct-14 Spring 2015 schedule begin processing Schedule Change Requests via the Portal 3-Nov-14 Spring 2015 continuing student registration begins We are deeply appreciative of the difficulty of this work and of the efforts of college enrollment managers, schedulers, department chairs, and associate deans. Thank you for your ongoing efforts to ensure that students are well-served.
