All fees, debts and financial obligations must be paid in full before the hold is released. Submitting a voucher by a third party does not release the student's liability of tuition and fees. Students will be responsible for any balance their voucher may not cover or if their third party fails to pay Chaffey College. Failure to pay any outstanding balances will result in the student's name being submitted to the Franchise Tax Board for collection of any balance owed to Chaffey College. Past due fees are accepted online, by mail, or in person. Returned payments due to insufficient funds, invalid account number entry, or stopping payment on a check or credit card does NOT constitute withdrawal from classes and will result in a $25.00 charge and a financial block on your account. Students will be charged for classes they are enrolled in, even if they never attend any class meetings. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure all classes are dropped by the appropriate refund deadline to avoid being charged. DO NOT rely on an instructor to drop you from class(es).
