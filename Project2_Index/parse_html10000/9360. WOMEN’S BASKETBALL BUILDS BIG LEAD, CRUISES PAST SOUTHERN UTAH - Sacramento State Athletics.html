Sacramento State (14-14, 12-5 Big Sky) led by at least 20 points over the final 30 minutes of the game, going up by as many as 36 in the first half and 38 in the second half. The loss eliminated Southern Utah (13-14, 6-11 Big Sky) from Big Sky tournament contention as the visitors made just one field goal over the first 10 and a half minutes of the contest. Sophomore Brianna Burgos led the Hornet attack with a career-high 19 points, shooting a superb 5-of-6 from 3-point range and 6-of-8 overall in 18 minutes played. "We started off with a lot of energy and we've been preaching being energized going into the (Big Sky) Tournament," Burgos said. "I felt good and that (the big scoring night) was long overdue. I need to keep shooting; my role on this team is to shoot the ball." Joining Burgos in double figures were Fantasia Hilliard (15 points), Hallie Gennett (14), Gretchen Harrigan (13), Adella Randle-El (11), Andrea Chenier (11), and Takara Burse (11). Freshman Maranne Johnson also finished with nine points while Hilliard led the team with eight rebounds and six assists. The Hornets shot 24-of-47 (51%) in the first half and were 12-of-24 (50%) from 3-point range. Southern Utah stated 1-of-9 from the field as the Hornets led 13-4 at the 15:46 mark and then had a 15-0 run to blow the game open early in the first half. The Sacramento State lead reached 36 points after a Hilliard 3-pointer in the final minute of the half and the home team led 61-27 at the intermission. Sacramento State cooled off from the field a bit in the second half but their enormous lead proved to be a big enough cushion. After hitting 12 threes in the first half the Hornets did not make a three over the first 14 minutes of the second half but stuck six 3-balls over the final six minutes of the game. Southern Utah shot 53% in the second half but never got closer than a 21-point deficit. Sacramento State went on a 13-2 run over a five and half minute stretch late in the second period and had a game-high 38 point lead after another Hilliard three with one minute left to play. The teams finished level at 46-46 in the second period. The Hornets surpassed 100 points for the second consecutive game and the fourth total time this season. For the game Sacramento State shot 49% from the field and finished 18-of-40 (45%) from 3-point rang. The Thunderbirds shot 49% overall but made just two 3-pointers, went 11-of-20 from the free throw line, and committed 28 turnovers, 18 of which came in the first half. The rebounds finished even at 41-41 with the Hornets grabbing 18 offensive boards. Sacramento State had a 40-16 edge in points off turnovers and had 14 steals, slightly behind its NCAA leading average of 16.6 steals per game. "In March in a conference game we're obviously pleased with the win. Any win right now is a good win," Sacramento State head coach Bunky Harkleroad said. "We're proud of the team for the way we came out and started the game; in the first half the energy was great and we were knocking shots down and doing a lot of things right. In the second half we showed that we still have a lot of work to do." Sacramento State solidified its No. 2 spot in the Big Sky and can guarantee a second-place finish with a home win at 2 p.m. Saturday in the regular season finale vs. Northern Arizona. The Lumberjacks, who beat the Hornets 64-60 in the Big Sky opener in Flagstaff, clinched a spot in the Big Sky Tournament with a 79-62 win Thursday night at Portland State. Prior to Saturday's senior day game the three Hornet seniors - Burse, Chenier, and Hilliard - will be honored in a pregame ceremony.
