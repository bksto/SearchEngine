If you’re like me, then you know summer planning starts now. For my group of friends and I, trying to get permits to climb Half Dome in Yosemite has been the hot topic of discussion this week. Regardless, there is always a weekend every summer where we end up getting out of our city lives to brave the outdoors. We’ve been doing this for years, but because none of us are professional lumberjacks, there is always that one friend who forgets to pack or bring something important that is crucial to the survival of the group. So, if you’re a planner like me, Pinterest has become an exclusive hot spot for outdoor tricks and tips, and an answer to all those forgetful friendships. OUTDOOR COMPASS: for the friend who suggests you all take a 12-mile hike in the absolute wilderness but forgets to pack the one tool that is supposed to tell you how to get back to the campsite: OUTDOOR READING LAMPS: for the friend who forgets to pack the extra flashlights even though you told him 12 times: listorama on Pinterest.

You’ve pounded on your keyboard, clicked refresh, but it’s still not updating and it’s driving you crazy. Don’t worry. You may not have broken Pinterest after all. Follow these easy steps and tips to make sure you’re Pinning the correct images. SIZE – is your image too small? Pinterest requires images to be at least 100x200 pixels. We want people to see and experience your Pin! IFRAME – is your image embedded or inserted in a webpage? These iframes, which are basically html documents inside of one another (think code within a code), are mostly found on Tumblr and may be the issue you’re experiencing. Pinterest unfortunately doesn’t allow embedded iframe images. BACKGROUND – Pinterest only allows images on the page, not backgrounds. FLICKR – if you catch a Pinspiring image on Pinterst on Flickr, double check if the owner of the images has allowed sharing. Often times the owners will make images private and is a reason your image isn’t working on Pinterest. There you go! Just double-check these four points and you should be smooth sailing with images on Pinterest. Remember, the Pin it button is an easy way to pin fresh content from all over the web. And if you need to re-install, visit our help center and add our Pin it buttons: our Chrome extension and Bookmarklet for all other browsers. We hope this helps you easily save all the things you love! —Pari Mathur, Content Guru, Currently pinning to Life is Funny Party dog © Felix Ding.

I discovered Pinterest about a month before getting engaged, and well, the rest is history. I can actually say that this very pin was my magical a-ha Pinterest moment. A ‘Tip Jar’ of wedding advice we can read for years to come? Yes, please. Fast-forward two years, and we’re now married and recently bought our first place in May - an original 1940s fixer-upper. With Pinterest as our guide to so many inspiring and useful ideas, remodeling has never been so much fun! Now for a few of my super-pinning tips: 1) Follow pinners with your taste It’s okay to be really picky with who you follow and what you pin. It’s worth doing a little digging to find pinners who share your specific tastes and interests. Then, take one more step and check out who they follow, too! Remember, following like-minded pinners will make your home feed better, because you’ll see more stuff you love from people like you. 2) Keep on scrollin’ I’ll tell you a secret. Ok, it’s not a secret, but a lot of people still might not know about the People who pinned this also pinned feature. To me, it’s the best way to find more pins like the ones you’re already loving. First, click on a close-up of a pin you like: here’s mine. Then, don’t forget to scroll down (keep scrolling!) until you see People who pinned this also pinned. There you’ll find pins like your close-up, plus new pin discoveries that might surprise you. I found this similar tufted headboard, but also this unexpected beautiful outdoors shot, and some desk accessories that would look great in our new place. This made for some fun finds along the way. 3) Take note! How we pinaholics ever lived without notifications, I’ll never know. I just love getting that ping on my phone or seeing the red box pop up on my web profile. It’s really a rush knowing people like the same things I do, and that with a little notification, comes yet another Pinterest path to click through and discover new pins.
