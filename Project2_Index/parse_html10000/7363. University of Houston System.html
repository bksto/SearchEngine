UH awards more than 8,500 degrees annually and has over 230,000 alumni.  The student body at UH ranks second in the nation among research universities for its ethnic diversity, with no majority race on campus, and is also very international in character, with students from more than 130 nations.  With more than 500 student organizations and 16 intercollegiate sports teams, campus life at UH is vibrant and engaging.  Within our seven residential communities, we house approximately 7,000 students – and have the second highest capacity for student residence in the state.  The University of Houston is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award baccalaureate, master's, professional and doctoral degrees.  Classified as a Tier One institution by virtue of its Very High Research ranking by the Carnegie Foundation, UH is also one of only 300 institutions nationwide to receive the Foundation's highest designation as a community-engaged university.  The University's distinguished faculty members include a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Pulitzer Prize winners as well as 14 members of the National Academies of Science and Engineering.  As a member of the Association of Research Libraries, UH is distinguished by the breadth and quality of its collections and services. Undergraduate Education The University of Houston has the most competitive admissions standards within the UH System.  Beginning in fall 2011, only freshmen who graduate in the top 10 percent of their high school class received automatic admission to the University.  The entering class of 2018 is larger, more academically prepared (with an average 1143 SAT) and more diverse than ever before. Once admitted, undergraduates at UH choose from 120 majors and minors housed in 12 academic colleges and an interdisciplinary Honors College, which is a nationally recognized community of the university's most talented students.  The University of Houston values undergraduate research as an important educational experience for students and as an essential skill for graduates seeking employment.  UH facilitates opportunities for all undergraduates to participate in research through multiple avenues, including a senior honors thesis program, an undergraduate research scholarship program, a summer undergraduate research fellowship program and assistance in applying for nationally competitive scholarships.  Almost half of the entering first-year class chose to participate in the new UHin4 program, which offers closely monitored academic and degree plan advising as well as a fixed rate tuition option.  Graduate Education The University of Houston offers 139 master's degrees, 54 doctoral degrees, and three professional degree programs (in Law, Optometry and Pharmacy).  Many of these programs are nationally recognized, with 10 of them ranked among the Top 50 in the country.  In particular, the entrepreneurship program in the C.T. Bauer College of Business that has been ranked among the top three by Entrepreneur Magazine and the Princeton Review for nearly a decade.  Additionally, the Law Center and the Graduate School of Social Work are consistently ranked in the top tier nationally. Research With more than $141 million in research expenditures in FY 2014, the University of Houston is home to more than 40 research labs, centers and institutes.  In order to enable scholars to explore emerging research areas and work more effectively with industry, other research organizations and the community, the University has established six interdisciplinary research clusters.  These clusters are powerful centers of creativity where teams of researchers from a wide range of disciplines collaborate across traditional boundaries to bring research knowledge to bear on issues of intellectual, scientific, social, economic, environmental and cultural importance.  UH research clusters include: Arts & Human Enrichment – Providing an understanding of different cultures and histories of the world and on human enrichment through the arts, media, and literature Bio-Med Sciences & Engineering – Improving human health through such fields as visual system development and treatment of eye diseases; chronic and infectious diseases; cancer; neurocognitive networks; bio-imaging, bio-materials, bio-molecular design and simulation; and genetics Community Advancement & Education – Improving well-being within communities through economic development, education and social work and fostering cultural sensitivity and diversity Complex Systems/Space Exploration – Concentrating on complex systems, such as human development disabilities; complex networks, such as information systems and artificial intelligence; and space exploration Energy & Natural Resources – Focusing on environmental issues, such as ecology and conservation, through discovery and recovery of fuels and alternative fuels and through particle physics and space radiation Nano-Materials –  Exploring advanced materials - such as applied electromagnetics, superconducting materials and devices, semiconductors, and advanced oxide films; nano-materials - such as nano-thin films, nano-mechanics, nano-magnetic materials and nano-system manufacturing; and structural materials - such as ceramics, composites, well logging, roads and subsurface sensing.
