There are two types of membership on the ARA board — director and alumni trustee. All alumni are eligible to serve as a director on the ARA board. ("Alumni" are defined as individuals who have attended Rice University one or more academic years, excluding current students.) Seven new directors are elected each year to serve terms of three years. Each director of the board must be committed to expend the time and energy necessary to make the ARA a success. The ARA board meets three times a year and all board members are expected to attend all meetings. Except for those decisions that are made by the board's Executive Committee in the interim, the business of the ARA is conducted at these three meetings. Above all, the members of the board represent the alumni body to the university and represent the ARA to its constituents — Rice alumni. Mission Statement The purpose of the Association of Rice Alumni (ARA) is to provide the means of a continuing relationship between the university and its former students. The association strives to stimulate intellectual and social participation of all members of the ARA. In addition, the association endeavors to foster deeper concern among its members for the welfare of the university, to strengthen the bond of understanding between the university and the community, to encourage gifts, to attract outstanding students and faculty, and to contribute toward maintaining Rice as a university in keeping with the ideals and aims of its founder.
