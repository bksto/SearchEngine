Admission Volunteers College Counselors Parents/Families APPLY It may seem challenging, but everything you need is right here. Start with requirements, and make sure you pay attention to deadlines! The Application Process Students often focus on getting in rather than representing themselves authentically. This is the moment to think deeply about who you are and what matters to you. Have confidence in what you have done and trust where you are going. Believe in yourself and reflect carefully on how you want to present yourself. In the strongest applications we read, a student's genuine voice stands out. Our staff is privileged to read your application and learn about your achievements, talents and goals. We approach the admission process with sincere respect for you, and we will give your application our most serious consideration. Thank you for your interest in Stanford. We wish you all the best.
