The circular layout of our campus reflects the peaceful unity within our diverse community. An important aspect of college life is engaging with fellow students within your new environment. Roughly 80 percent of UCI freshmen choose to live on-campus which provides many advantages – convenient access to campus resources, more contact with faculty and staff, and numerous opportunities to form new friendships and a sense of community. Housing On-campus housing is guaranteed for two years to all incoming freshmen who meet application and contract-return deadlines. UCI transfer students are guaranteed one year of on-campus housing in apartments or academic-theme housing. For more information on UCI's housing guarantee, visit www.housing.uci.edu. Students who are either married or in a domestic partnership, single parents, or over the age of 25 can apply for on-campus family housing. Family housing is not included in the housing guarantee. UCI provides convenient, comfortable, and secure undergraduate housing options, including residence halls, academic theme houses, fraternity and sorority houses, international houses, and apartments. All student rooms are equipped with high speed Internet and cable TV connections. Housing Communities Mesa Court and Middle Earth are primarily freshman communities offering a wide range of theme halls with live-in resident advisors. Arroyo Vista includes sophomores, juniors, and seniors. It offers an alternative to traditional residential hall living with 42 different academic theme, international, transfer, and fraternity and sorority houses for undergraduate students. Campus Village accommodates continuing students in two bedroom, one bath apartments which serves students who are seeking a more independent style of living. Vista del Campo, Vista del Campo Norte, Camino del Sol and Puerta del Sol are privately owned and managed apartment communities located on the east side of the UC Irvine campus, offering furnished apartments to single students who are sophomores, juniors, seniors, or graduate students.  Vista del Campo has been named Best Student Housing Apartment Community by the National Association of Home builders. Dining Whether it's a tasty bite to eat before class, dinner, or a place to hang out, UCI Hospitality and Dining is here to satisfy all your cravings. We have three all-you-care-to-eat dining restaurants and over 15 retail dining locations to choose from. Our dining locations are situated throughout the campus so you are only minutes away from grabbing a complete meal. Some of our popular restaurants include Starbucks Coffee, Organic Greens to Go, Wendy's, Wahoo's Fish Taco, Anthill Pub & Grille, Jamba Juice, Subway and Panda Express.

Off campus, within walking distance, are plenty of places to eat and meet with friends for burgers, pizza, sandwiches, yogurt, coffee, or even to dine at full service restaurants. A short ride from campus there is an even greater variety of dining establishments to fit all budgets. Some of the off campus eateries include In-N-Out Burger, Yogurtland, Del Taco, Chipotle, California Pizza Kitchen, Daphne’s Greek Café, McDonald’s, P.F. Chang’s, Islands, and many more.
