Both have relatives who attended the University including both of their mothers, all of Tony’s siblings, aunts including Anna Claire Mauerhan, Sherryl’s sister, and two of their own children. “We have a heritage of loving this place,” Tony said. Tony, a current Board of Trustee member, received his bachelor’s in business administration at Redlands. He spent almost two decades in several management positions at IBM Corporation. Sherryl received her bachelor’s in 1964 and later received her master’s from UC Irvine. They both have traveled with the Salzburg program as students and as alums. Another reason that keeps Tony and Sherryl connected to the University is friendship. “We’ve stayed in touch with six to eight couples throughout the years and we try to get together at least once a year. We’ve grown up together, we’ve had children, we’ve been part of each other’s lives,” Tony said. “I’m thrilled to see how the University has changed and grown,” Sherryl said. “We think of the wonderful experiences that we had as students and even though some things have changed, students at Redlands still experience warm friendships, the opportunity to learn in small classes, and to have professors that really care about their subject matter and teaching.” Volunteerism and philanthropy are at the heart of Tony and Sherryl’s work. Community service and environmental protection are especially important to them. The Taylor Family Community Service Scholarship established by Tony and his siblings honors their parents who modeled service to others in their lives. It is awarded to a Redlands student who shows a passion for community service. A scholarship that Tony and Sherryl established is awarded to students with interest in the environmental sciences. Both Tony and Sherryl are passionate about preserving land and ecosystems. Sherryl is committed to the preservation of Mono Lake in the Eastern Sierra as a volunteer and board member for the Mono Lake Committee and Tony has worked for 12 years to preserve open space in the Eastern Sierra as President of the Eastern Sierra Land Trust. When they are not working to preserve the area they live in, they enjoy the incredible beauty and the many recreation opportunities the region offers. Tony and Sherryl have been avid supporters of the University for decades. Among the initiatives they have supported are the Chapel campaign and the Redlands Fund. They have participated in the Bulldog Bench Golf Tournament and have included Redlands in estate planning. In recent years, Tony’s fundraising focus has gone beyond scholarships as he chairs his class of 1963 50-year reunion and supports the class campaign to raise $1,963,000. Sherryl looks forward to her 50 year reunion next year and will be involved in fundraising for her class as well. “We are grateful for the opportunities that Redlands provides for students and we are glad to support the University’s efforts in any way that we can,” Sherryl said.
