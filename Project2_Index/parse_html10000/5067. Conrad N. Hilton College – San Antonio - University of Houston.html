Hilton College – Lima Global Hospitality Master's Program Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor Gourmet Night Sugar Land Wine & Food Affair Cougar Grounds Barron’s Restaurant Conrad N. Hilton College – San Antonio Due to overwhelming demand by area employers, the University of Houston’s Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management—consistently ranked among the top hospitality programs in the world—has expanded into San Antonio, becoming the city’s first provider of a Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management. Graduates of the Conrad N. Hilton College – San Antonio will earn the same, prestigious degree as if they’d attended four years at the University of Houston, all without ever leaving the Alamo City. The Conrad N. Hilton College – San Antonio exclusively offers the upper-division courses needed to complete a bachelor’s-level hospitality degree. Students can fulfill their freshman- and sophomore-level courses locally at our partner school, St. Philip’s College. Credits will also be accepted from other accredited two-year colleges and four-year universities. Renovations are currently under way on the College’s new campus in Sunset Station’s historic Mission Hotel building, just steps from the Alamodome. This state-of-the-art facility, scheduled to open in July 2015, will feature multiple well-appointed student spaces, labs and other world-class amenities, including the J. Willard and Alice Sheets Marriott Center for Student Excellence. Generous scholarships are available for incoming freshmen, transfer students and adult learners. For more information, submit this form and a representative from the College will contact you.
