It is currently composed of the administrative units of the Provost and Vice President's Office (Welch Hall D-440), and the Associate Vice President for Academic Resources Management and Planning. The Colleges of Arts and Humanities; Business Administration and Public Policy; Education; Extended and International Education; Health, Human Services, and Nursing; and Natural and Behavioral Sciences are integral parts of the Division and are centers for the varied academic programs offered by the University. The Leo F. Cain Library is also vital to the mission of the institution. The mission of the Division of Academic Affairs is to ensure that the University's Mission and goals are accomplished. We believe in academic excellence, community service, and the core values of liberal education that we will infuse in all of our programs. We strongly endorse diversity in our academic and employment policies and practices. We will do this by offering academic and cultural programs of excellence and by fostering an environment conducive to student learning in an urban context of unprecedented demographic diversity. We will further ensure students and faculty collaboration aimed at creating a learning community and by fostering faculty research and creative activity, which will advance knowledge and aesthetic appreciation in our constituencies. We aim to provide the academic, cultural, and social framework that will make this university a model of what public urban higher education can be for now and in the future. The Division of Academic Affairs believes that student learning occurs both inside and outside of the classroom and, therefore, encourages student to participate in extracurricular activities sponsored by their academic departments and by Associated Students, Inc. We also encourage students to take advantage of the learning opportunities offered through Service Learning and internships available within the domain of the University. A wide variety of non-traditional opportunities are also available through the sponsorship of the Division of Student Affairs.
