Meet with an Academic Advisor Academic Forms Minimum Grades/GPA Acceptable Withdrawing from CoA CougarOne Card Assistance Registration Assistance ﻿When can I speak to my academic advisor? All current CoA undergraduate students should schedule an appointment with an academic advisor via their myUH accounts. If you are having trouble making an appointment via your myUH account, you may contact the Student Services Office to schedule an appointment. Please visit the Student Services Office page for contact information, office hours, and more. ﻿Where can I get a General Petition, release waiver, and other academic forms? All academic forms are located in the Student Services Office. Simply ask for a form at the front desk. Some forms can also be found on the Academic Forms page. Please visit the Student Services Office page for contact information, office hours, and more. Where do I turn in forms? All academic paperwork—General Petitions, applications, drop forms, release waivers, etc.—need to be submitted at the front desk of the Student Services Office. Students will need to follow up on the status of the forms through their myUH accounts and/or e-mailing their assigned academic advisor. Please visit the Student Services Office page for contact information, office hours, and more. I've already earned credit for a similar course on the degree plan. What can I do so I won't have to take the course again? Students need to submit a Transfer Credit Petition, which can be picked up from the Student Services Office. Fill out the required information on the form, and attach it to the syllabus from the course you earned credit in. Submit everything to the Student Services Office. ﻿What is the minimum grade I can earn in my studio courses? Students must earn a C- or better to advance to the next studio. If you earn below a C-, you will need to retake the studio. Consult with your academic advisor for more information. What is the minimum grade I can earn in my other courses? Students must earn a D- to obtain credit for courses. Any grades below D- will not be accepted for credit. Consult with your academic advisor for more information. What is the minimum grade point average I have to earn? All undergraduate students must earn at least a 2.0 grade point average. If a student earns lower than the required grade point average, then a subsequent warning, probation, suspension or loss of financial support will follow. ﻿If I withdraw and choose to complete my degree at a later date, how long do I have to return? Students must consult with their academic advisor to inform the College about withdrawing. If a student chooses to resume studies after 13 months of inactivity at the University of Houston, then he or she must reapply to the program. ﻿Why doesn't my CougarOne card allow me access into the building? You’ll need to contact the college administrator, Mary Benham and send your information: name, myUH ID, and date when your card did not allow you access. ﻿I'm trying to register for a class, but can't seem to do it. What should I do? Keep track of your account. Your myUH account will inform you of any holds placed. It is your responsibility to make sure they are cleared before registering or you will not be able to enroll in any courses. Be sure to check the prerequisites before attempting to enroll in a course. If you do not meet the prerequisites, you will not be able to enroll. If you meet the prerequisites and are still not able to enroll, then fill out a General Petition stating course information (ex. ARCH 3397, along with class number and any other lecture or lab numbers) to request enrollment assistance. You will not be able to enroll in courses after the Official Reporting Date for the University, which is the 12th class day in Fall and Spring, or the 4th class day during Summer. I was dropped from my class and need to get back in. What should I do? Keep track of your account. Make sure to pay tuition and fees on time. This is a reason students are generally dropped. If you need to make arrangements or dispute a fee bill, you’ll need to speak to Student Financial Services either by going in person to the Welcome Center or calling 713-743-1010. If you have already resolved your fee bill, along with any other holds and are still unable to enroll, then fill out a General Petition stating course information (ex. ARCH 3397, along with class number and any other lecture or lab numbers) to request enrollment assistance. Do this before the Official Reporting Date for the University, which is the 12th class day during Fall and Spring, or the 4th class day during Summer. Any requests after the ORD will not be processed. Once enrolled in the course, pay your fee bill immediately or make arrangements with Student Financial Services. If you don’t, you risk being dropped again. Re-enrollment is not guaranteed.
