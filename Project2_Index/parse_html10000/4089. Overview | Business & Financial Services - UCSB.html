We prepare and process an average of 21,000 pieces of University mail per month. Mail Services is dedicated to the timely processing and delivery of interdepartmental and US Postal Service (USPS) Mail and related services. We provide an essential link, ensuring the efficient flow of mail between the US Postal Service and the campus community Since Mail Services handles correspondence related to University business only, faculty and staff should make arrangements to receive personal mail at home. Delivery and Collection Delivery and collection schedules are set by Mail Services based on building locations and mail volume. There are five mail routes which are delivered daily between 8 am and 10:30 am, depending on the route.  Our carriers do not collect or deliver mail to unauthorized areas. Changes in delivery or pick-up location must first be authorized by Mail Services. Requests for new, or changes to existing stops, can be requested by completing and submitting the appropriate Form. To facilitate service, all departments should establish a standard location for mail delivery and pick-up, providing three labeled boxes for: incoming mail off-campus (outgoing) mail campus mail Your off-campus mail will be processed more quickly if it is separated or bundled by group, as follows: Stamped To Be Metered International Special Services by USPS Incoming Mail We pick-up our mail from USPS every morning at approximately 8:00 am.
