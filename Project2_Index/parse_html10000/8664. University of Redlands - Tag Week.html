Most students don’t realize how much on campus is provided by private support. So we’re beginning to change that! The purpose of Tag Week is to educate students, using a more interactive and tangible approach, on the importance of philanthropy. This education is coming directly from students and endowed chair faculty to create a more meaningful connection to giving back. Student volunteers from ASUR Cabinet and Senate, Maroon and Gray Student Ambassadors, Admissions Hosts, and the Student Advancement Team are all spearheading the education, teaching their peers about the impact of giving at the U of R. The primary goal of this initiative is education. If students leave the U of R with a better sense of how philanthropy shaped their time on campus and how it continually builds this campus, then it will be a job well done! It started with large banners being hung on seven buildings on campus—all of which were made possible by private gifts. The banners, in essence, represent a gift tag. In front of each “tagged” building were signs containing some brief history and background of the gift- who gave the money to build it, how much it cost, & when it was built. Throughout the week, endowed chair faculty spent a few minutes during each of their classes to educate their students on what it means to have an endowed chair position. Few students know that these positions are made possible by large gifts and that it allows the University to obtain the highest caliber faculty, furthers opportunities for faculty research, and creates opportunities for student research projects. By mid-week, the student volunteers were all wearing the same brightly colored shirt. The idea being that if 200 students all wore the same shirt on the same day, people on campus would ask questions. “Why are you wearing this shirt?” “What is Tag Week?” This allowed for the students to educate their peers, along with staff and faculty, about what philanthropy has done, and currently does, on this campus. It culminated with student volunteers handing out paper banks in which to deposit loose change. Students need to know that it’s the participation the counts- not the amount! Seldom does a donor begin his or her giving with a $10,000 gift! Facilitated by students, there will be “change collection days” throughout the semester, tracking how quickly change can add up and supporting the Redlands Fund, which goes right back to students via study abroad, scholarships, and student activities.
