Who We Are Founded in 1989, California State University San Marcos is a new kind of university — technologically sophisticated, fully engaged in the community and pushing the boundaries of innovation. Our hands-on, real-world curriculum and applied research fuels the creativity that yields ideas to solve critical 21st century problems. Today, more than 10,000 students attend our 304-acre, state-of-the-art main campus, which is fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and is the 20th campus established in the 23-campus CSU system. Location You'll have the best of all worlds. Located in the foothills of San Marcos, California (northern San Diego County), just a short distance from some of Southern California’s best beaches and an hour from the U.S.-Mexico border. Only miles from the hustle and bustle of major cities such as San Diego and Los Angeles, but nestled in a quiet, suburban neighborhood (population 55,000). While our campus is expansive (we're talking 304 acres), it's tucked into the foothills overlooking the city, creating a tight-knit community right here on campus.
