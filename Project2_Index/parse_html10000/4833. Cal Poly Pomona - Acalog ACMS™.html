Congratulations on taking this first step towards one of life’s greatest, and most rewarding adventures! As John F. Kennedy, our 35th President of the United States, wrote: “Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream, which fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation.” Here at Cal Poly Pomona, one of only nine polytechnic universities in the nation, you will receive the highest quality education that is aimed at fulfilling your “private hopes and dreams” of success. In our “learn by doing” environment, you will put theory into practice, and you will be well prepared to enter the work force or graduate school, or make other contributions that are not only beneficial to you, but also to your family, community, and indeed our nation and beyond. In fact, our graduates are among the country’s most sought-after professionals. Excellent faculty is a hallmark of Cal Poly Pomona, and many of them are nationally distinguished in their fields.  More importantly, they are a dedicated and talented group who, along with outstanding staff and administrators, are committed to your educational success.  I am confident that the friends you make and the partnerships you form during your time with us, will be among the most memorable and treasured of your lifetime. You will have the opportunity to select from a broad array of programs, many of which have earned a national reputation.  Cal Poly Pomona has been ranked by the Center on Higher Education Reform as one of the best universities for delivering access, affordability and student success.  This ranking validates Cal Poly Pomona’s core values of access to academic quality and the celebration of diversity. The collegiate experience is much more than academic coursework, with more than 250 student clubs and organizations you learn and practice skills of team building and leadership, while making contributions to the campus and community. I invite you to become a part of our university family and encourage you to take advantage of the many opportunities that await you here at Cal Poly Pomona where your dreams can soar! I look forward to seeing you on campus. Sincerely, Soraya Coley, President “Student-Centered, Faculty and Staff-Focused, and Community-Minded”  Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page     All catalogs © 2015 Cal Poly Pomona.
