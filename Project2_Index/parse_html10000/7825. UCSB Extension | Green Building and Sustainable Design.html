Each of the courses required for the program will be offered one more time over the next academic year, through June 2015, to ensure that all current certificate candidates have an opportunity to complete the program. The matrix to the right indicates the current schedule plan for the 2014-2015 academic year. We will not accept new candidates for the program beyond September 30, 2014. Please note: Certain courses offered as part of this program will continue to be offered on an individual basis. The Green Building and Sustainable Design Professional Certificate Program is designed to provide participants with a solid foundation in the green building field. Upon completion of the certificate, students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of basic sustainable planning and design concepts. Program Audience The target audience includes local professionals looking to gain insight into, or shift over to, the green building field. This includes city and county employees, contractors, architects, inspectors, realtors, interior designers, and homeowners. The program is also of interest to recent and upcoming graduates from colleges and universities who are looking for a more detailed, specific education in green building. Professional Application Completion of the certificate program shows a prospective or current employer evidence of recent professional-level training in this field. Course work can be applied toward career advancement. Students gain an understanding of the term "green building" and the wide range of concepts and principles considered during green building design, construction, operation, and maintenance. The program provides access to local green building projects and professionals, allowing for exploration and networking in the local green building community. Information is presented about the LEED rating system and certificate process, as well as various other statewide and national green building certificate programs and current green building regulations and codes. Students will be able to directly apply their understanding of "green materials" and utilize the resources available to find and rate materials based on their green properties. Description Recommended Course Sequence It is recommended that students begin with Sustainability: A Green Building Overview . As its name implies, this course offers students an overview of basic green building principles and practices. Sustainability:A Green Building Overview is a prerequisite for Green Building Materials, Strategic Waste Management, and Sustainable Planning and Site Design. Course Credit Courses are approved at the professional, post-baccalaureate level (X400 series). Courses at this level offer special opportunities for professional, paraprofessional, and other career advancement. Course units are listed with the course descriptions. As the continuing education division of the University of California at Santa Barbara, UCSB Extension is fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). All courses in the program are approved for professional-level, post-graduate credit. This type of credit is typically recognized by government and industry for full or partial tuition funding or reimbursement. Course units and/or CEU values are listed with the course descriptions. Completion of the program shows evidence to a prospective or current employer of recent professional-level training and development in this field for career advancement and/or salary increase purposes. Questions regarding transferability of credit toward degree programs at other schools should be directed to the degree-granting institution. Transfer Credit Transfer credit is limited to 4 quarter units. Proposed transfer courses taken at other schools must be comparable in content and length to the UCSB Extension equivalent and must have been taken from an accredited college or university within the last five years. To determine whether courses taken at other schools will qualify, send a copy of the course title, description, and the dates the course was taken along with the UCSB Extension course title equivalent(s) to the certificate advisor. The advisor will inform students whether the coursework is transferable. To activate the formal transfer of credit, students must have filed their Application for Candidacy in the certificate program and must request the school previously attended to send an official transcript to the certificate advisor. What students are saying... Overall the Green Building program at UCSB was an amazing experience, I might even call it career changing. For me personally, it was really the catalyst to new perspectives, understanding, opinions and behavior. The program gave me the foundation I needed to sit for my LEED Green Associate Exam. Kassy Morris Project Coordinator, Staples Construction ---------------------------------------- Our classmates were from all parts of the construction field; architects, engineers, home owners, other general contractors, and accredited LEED members. I was going to start studying to get LEED accredited and then I heard about UCSB Extension starting classes for a Green Building Certificate. I thought what a great way to learn and become exposed to this field. I was also excited that the instructors were actually hands on people in the green building field. Marissa Roman Assistant Project Manager, Staples Construction ---------------------------------------- I originally graduated from the Bren School at UCSB and received my Master's in Environmental Science and Management in 2001. I heard about UCSB Extension's Green Building and Sustainable Design certificate from a friend and thought it would be a great opportunity to refresh my Master's degree. I eventually went back to school for my teaching credential and M.Ed. Young people are very open to environmental protection and sustainability measures. Honestly, I think I can do more to help the environment by educating young people on the topic.
