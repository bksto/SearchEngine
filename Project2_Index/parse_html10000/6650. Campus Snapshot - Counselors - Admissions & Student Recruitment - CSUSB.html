The California State College system’s board of trustees selected a 430-acre campus site in north San Bernardino in 1963, and the college’s official name was changed to California State College at San Bernardino.  The original three-building campus opened to its first 293 students in 1965 under the leadership of founding President John Pfau, who was appointed in 1962. In 1967, the college celebrated its first graduating class of 59 students.  The campus gained university status in 1984 and is now known as California State University, San Bernardino. The university opened the satellite campus Coachella Valley Center in 1986 on the grounds of the College of the Desert in Palm Desert. The first building of a permanent campus opened in Palm Desert in 2002, and expansion continues at what is now known as CSUSB’s Palm Desert Campus.
