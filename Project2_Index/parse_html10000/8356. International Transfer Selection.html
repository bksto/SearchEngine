When UCSB cannot admit all eligible applicants it uses standards to select students that are more competitive than the minimum requirements. These standards, which the university calls selection criteria, identify students who have demonstrated high academic achievement and the capacity to contribute to the intellectual vitality of the campus community. Learn more about selective majors for transfer: Selective Majors for Transfer UCSB seeks to enroll well-prepared transfer students who clearly meet the University of California's minimum requirements for admission at the time they apply. UCSB accepts junior-level transfers and will give priority consideration to those from California community colleges. The College of Letters and Science and the College of Engineering do not accept applicants who have achieved senior-level status (this is applicable only for students who have attended another four-year institution). Frequently, the number of applications exceeds the number of enrollment spaces available. When this occurs, selection criteria beyond the minimum admission requirements are used to determine admission status. Students are strongly encouraged to begin taking English composition and mathematics coursework early in their academic careers. Early completion of the minimum requirements for admission makes an applicant more competitive for admission spaces available.
