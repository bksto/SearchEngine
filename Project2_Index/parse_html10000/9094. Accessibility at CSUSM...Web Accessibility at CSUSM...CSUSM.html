With this wide audience in mind, CSUSM also pays careful attention to making sure that its campus facilities, along with online content, is accessible to those with special needs. The CSU requires faculty to provide accessible materials as part of their Assistive Technology Initiative (ATI). The Assistive Technology Initiative calls for accessible classroom materials at the point of: a course redesign, when a student needs such accessible materials, or by the fall of 2012. Accessible material includes all course materials and university websites. Existing material may need to be revised or reformatted to allow access to all viewers/students. These formats may include: Braille, enlarged fonts, electronic copies, audio copies, or captioning of videos, and may be processed through the Etext team. Web Accessibility Faculty, staff, and web content owners can submit their online content to be checked or made accessible for them.The Web Accessibility team spends the majority of their time ensuring the accessibility of all university related web sites, web content, and web applications for people with disabilities. These committed individuals also offer up universal design and accessibility services where staff and faculty can submit their content to be checked or edited for accessibility. Users can report accessibility issues that are encountered within university-affiliated web sites. Workshops are also provided to individuals who would like to learn more about how to better make their content accessible.   © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
