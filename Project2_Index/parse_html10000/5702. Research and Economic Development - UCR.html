Research and Economic Development has established a pilot program to stimulate and encourage UCR's participation in the U.S. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, as well as increase interactions with promising small business concerns (SBCs) interested in advancing innovative technology of mutual interest. Through this pilot program, UCR will waive all facilities and administrative (F&A) cost on all UCR subcontract proposals to SBCs applying for either SBIR or STTR Phase 1 funding. The pilot program is effective immediately and will continue through June 30, 2015, at which time the program will be evaluated to determine if it will continue.

Request Form Templates Summary Research and Economic Development  has established a pilot program to stimulate and encourage UCR's participation in the U.S. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, as well as increase interactions with promising small business concerns (SBCs) interested in advancing innovative technology of mutual interest. Through this pilot program, UCR will waive all  facilities and administrative (F&A) cost on all UCR subcontract proposals to SBCs applying for either SBIR or STTR Phase 1 funding. The pilot program is effective immediately and will continue through June 30, 2015, at which time the program will be evaluated to determine if it will continue. It is important to note that this pilot program does not apply to SBIR or STTR Phase II funding, which will continue to be subject to UCR's standard applicable research F&A cost rate. Background The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a highly competitive research funding program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) that has the potential for commercialization. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed R/R&D efforts.  If a SBC partners with a nonprofit research institution (NRI), the SBIR award is made to the SBC who is then responsible for subcontracting to the NRI. As a requirement of the funding program, SBCs must carry out at least 67% of the proposed research and/or analytical effort. The remaining 33% may be conducted by the NRI partner.  SBIR differs from STTR in two important aspects: 1.      The principal investigator must have primary employment with the SBC (unless a waiver is granted by the agency). 2.      SBIR encourages but does not require the SBC to partner with a research institution. The STTR program is a competitive research funding program aimed at  stimulating technological innovation, fostering technology transfer and increasing private sector commercialization of technologies arising from federal funding. The central focus of this program is bridging the gap between basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations.   STTR differs from SBIR in three important aspects: The SBC and its partnering institution are required to establish an intellectual property agreement detailing the allocation of intellectual property rights and rights to carry out follow-on research, development or commercialization activities. STTR requires that the SBC perform at least 40% of the R&D and the single partnering research institution to perform at least 30% of the R&D. Unlike the SBIR program, STTR does not require the Principal Investigator to be primarily employed by the SBC. Each Federal agency participating in the SBIR and/or STTR program is responsible for administering its own program within guidelines established by Congress. General information about both of these programs and the Federal agencies participating in them may be found at http://www.sbir.gov/. Pilot Program Guidelines The following guidelines are applicable to this pilot program: Only subcontract proposals to SBCs applying for either SBIR or STTR Phase I funding are eligible for this pilot program. Subcontract proposals under this pilot program may exclude  F&A costs from the budget. A separate request, using the approved template forms must be submitted, with the eCAF, to Sponsored Programs  Administration (SPA) for each proposal under this pilot program. SPA will endorse the request form and submit it to the UC Office of the President for approval.    Request form templates SBIR F&A Waiver Letter STTR F&A Waiver Letter Questions regarding this pilot program should be directed to either Charles Greer,  Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research at (951) 827-3093 or charles.greer@ucr.edu or Cynthia Wells,  Director of Sponsored Programs Administration at (951) 827-4918 or cynthia.wells@ucr.edu.   Vice Chancellor for Research Newsletters Check out the Vice Chancellor for Research newsletters to catch the latest news.
