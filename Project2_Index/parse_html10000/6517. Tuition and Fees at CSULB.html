Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fees, without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by The Board of Trustees. How Much to Pay Here are the Tuition and Mandatory Fees that all students must pay. Fees are subject to change without advance notice.

Students pursuing an advanced or service credential or who are simultaneously enrolled in a Master's program pay the Graduate rate. Non-Resident Tuition If you are not a resident of California , you must add $372.00 to the above totals for each unit of credit you take. Example for a non-resident undergraduate who wishes to register for 12 units: Find your Total Tuition and Mandatory Fees in the table above: $3,226.00. Multiply the number of units you will take by 372: 12 units X 372 = $4,464.00. Add the answers: $3,226.00 + $4,464 = $7,690.00. You may be exempt from nonresident classification if you are a teacher, military service member, CSU staff member, a California high school graduate who has attended a California high school at least three years, or a dependent child of California residents. If so, you must apply for an exemption every semester through Enrollment Services. See Establishing Residency.

The pre-semester payment deadline is: Fall 2015: August 12, 2015 Deadline to pay fees before instruction begins Spring 2015: January 7, 2015 Deadline to pay fees before instruction begins Once the pre-semester payment deadline has passed, payment is due the same day of registration. These same deadlines apply if you add classes or are moved from a waitlist into classes and, as a result, owe additional fees. If you do not pay by your payment due date, you may be dropped from your classes unless you have a financial aid fee deferment in place. You are encouraged to make payment immediately to confirm your registration requests and to avoid possible cancellation of all or some of your classes. You may make a payment before you register, but must check your account at MyCSULB immediately after registering to determine if any additional fees are due. If you qualify for a full or partial financial aid fee deferment or have a third party sponsorship, you will only need to pay any remaining balance due. You are responsible for confirming your enrollment by making any payment necessary even if you do not receive an invoice or reminder of a balance due and deadline date. Make sure you check your account balance regularly at MyCSULB for payment due dates and financial aid activity, to pay fees, verify payment has been received and processed and to track and pay additional fees due to schedule adjustments or being moved from a waitlist into a class. It is also your responsibility to drop classes, regardless of the reason, by the published deadlines to avoid charges or be eligible for a full or pro-rated refund. Failure to track your enrollment and student account records may result in charges and holds, restricting access to critical university services. If you had a Financial Aid fee deferment in place when you registered, and are later determined ineligible for aid, or you decline your aid, you must drop your classes. Students who do not plan to attend any classes should drop all classes before the first day of instruction. Once instruction begins, students who drop all their classes will owe pro-rated fees based on the date of withdrawal. Paying Your Fees After Classes Start Late Registration Fee Fee Payment Deadlines Late Registration Fee If you register on or after the first day of instruction, your Tuition and Mandatory Fees will include an additional $25 non-refundable Late Registration Fee.

The final deadline to pay fees is: Fall 2015: September 21, 2015 Census Spring 2015: February 16, 2015 Census A $10 late payment fee will be assessed on balances past due after August 12, 2015 and after September 21, 2015 for the Fall 2015 term. For the Spring 2015 term, the late payment fee will be assessed after January 7, 2015 and after February 16, 2015 . If payment is not made, a hold will be placed on your account, preventing further enrollment activity, transcript and other services. You will not be cancelled from classes immediately. Students who fail to pay by the final deadline with a balance greater than $1,500.00 may have all their classes cancelled, owe pro-rated fees for these classes, have a hold put on their account until the pro-rated fees are paid, be withdrawn from the University and may not be eligible to re-enroll.
