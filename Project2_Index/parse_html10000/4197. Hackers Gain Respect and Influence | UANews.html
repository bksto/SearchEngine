Hack Arizona, a student-run event to be held at the UA, will involve more than 400 hackers from across the nation in a competition that reflects the evolution of the state's tech ecosystem. The UA student-run Hack Arizona event will be held in the UA Science-Engineering Library, 744 N. Highland Ave. Merging a ukulele and a drone could result in a machine powered by the instrument's chord progressions. Having access to a medical library database could lead to the development of a new mobile application more robust than what WebMD provides. And new-generation holograms, afforded by advances in optics, may be adopted to create ultramodern video games. These are examples of contemporary hacking — and they are exactly the types of hacking innovations that University of Arizona student Nick Morin and his colleagues are supporting with the launch of Hack Arizona, the largest hackathon in the Southwest. "Hacking has evolved into a new meaning. It's about making something better," said Morin, director of InnovateUA, an organization designed to foster a student-led culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. "Hacking is becoming an innovative term about making something better and improving the future." Morin, a student in the School of Information Resources and Library Science, is the marketing director of a UA student-led team launching the inaugural Hack Arizona. The event is sanctioned by Major League Hacking, an organization that helps organize more than 100 student hackathons each year across North America and Europe. The March 6-8 event at the UA will involve more than 400 student designers, developers and makers from across the country in workshops and a 36-hour competition, which will include an awards ceremony. The event schedule is online. Backed by a hefty suite of sponsors — Raytheon, Amazon.com, State Farm and the Department of Defense are among them — participants will have access to parrot drones and other forms of software and hardware to develop new projects around the themes of sustainability and health. Sponsors are sending employees to help participants on site. In a blog post this month, Michele Norin, the UA's vice president for information technology and chief information officer, wrote about the importance of the event. "Hackathons have emerged as a creative, hands-on approach to develop solutions to technical challenges or barriers in the field of information technology," Norin said. "I have come to view hacking as another term for problem solving." She said that the hackathon "hits two main pillars of the University's strategic mission — to encourage more students to explore STEM-related disciplines and to promote hands-on student engagement by solving real-world technical challenges and problems." The free event also will include guest speakers and workshops. "With Hack Arizona, we seek to represent a new generation of innovators, and give them the voice and opportunity to start making a difference in the burgeoning tech industry of the Southwest," Morin said. "The opportunities are endless. With the brilliant students, passionate sponsors and the newest technologies, Hack Arizona promises to be an unforgettable weekend of exciting collaboration, learning and fun."
