The new species, dubbed Denisovans, were neither modern humans nor Neanderthals, though they apparently bred with our ancestors. Read More December 22, 2010 Learning to Read the Genome LBNL and UC Berkeley researchers have gone beyond the mere genetic sequence of the fruit fly to reveal the RNA and chromatin structures that tell us how cells work. The new analysis of the fruit fly and roundworm genomes was performed by the modENCODE team.

Read More December 20, 2010 Scientist's new book will make you an instant physicist (maybe) UC Berkeley physicist Richard Muller, author of "Physics for Future Presidents," has published a new book - "The Instant Physicist" - with brief physics anecdotes and clever cartoons. Read More December 19, 2010 Engineers take plasmon lasers out of deep freeze UC Berkeley researchers have developed a new technique that allows plasmon lasers to operate at room temperature, overcoming a major barrier to practical utilization of the technology. Previous plasmon laser devices required temperatures as low as minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit to function properly.

Read More December 16, 2010 First measurement of magnetic field in Earth's core Measurements of the magnetic field at the earth's surface can tell only so much about the dynamo producing the field in the planet's core. UC Berkeley geophysicist Bruce Buffett has now used precise astronomical position data to calculate tidal damping in the core and determine for the first time the magnetic field in the center of the planet. The measurement, 25 Gauss, is in the middle of what various scientists have predicted.
