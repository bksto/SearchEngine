Aggies Talk segments on YouTube The Faculty of Texas A&M With membership in the prestigious Association of American Universities, Texas A&M seeks to attract the best and brightest faculty who exemplify the highest standards in teaching, research and scholarship. Our distinguished faculty which includes winners of the Nobel Prize, Wolf Prize, and National Medal of Science, as well as more than 2,800 other award-winning teachers and researchers in 16 colleges and schools, are in the classroom and laboratory every day preparing the next generation of leaders and pursuing life-changing research discoveries. With the recent addition of the Texas A&M Health Science Center as a unit within the university, an additional 1,777 faculty members work across a variety of health care disciplines, including medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacology and public health. Almost 90 percent of the faculty hold doctoral degrees or terminal degrees in their field and 300 hold endowed professorships or chairs. Twenty-seven faculty are members of the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering or Institute of Medicine. More than 500 hold the title of fellow or a title of equal significance in their respective fields. Texas A&M has completed the most ambitious faculty expansion effort in the University's history. The five-year faculty reinvestment campaign, supported by the Texas Legislature, added 447 new faculty positions. © 2015 Texas A&M University College Station, Texas 77843 Site Policies Web Accessibility Emergency Preparedness
