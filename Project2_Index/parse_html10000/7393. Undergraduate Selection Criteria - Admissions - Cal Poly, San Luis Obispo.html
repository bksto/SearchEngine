Parent VIP Page Cost of Attendance After Cal Poly Graduate Programs International Selection Criteria for Undergraduate Applicants.* Cal Poly comprehensively reviews all applications as we look for students who have strong academic records and are active in and outside the classroom. Selection to all majors is competitive and Cal Poly continues to have more qualified applicants than available new student spaces. Beyond the basic qualifications for the California State University, Cal Poly considers other factors for admission and does so in an objective format. In fact, it is impossible to predict a candidate’s chances of admission by looking at the academic record alone. That is why when we review your application, we consider an array of factors as applicants compete to be selected against other applicants for the same major. Our selection criteria vary between levels and, for transfers, between majors. After you have decided on the major for which to apply, your next step is access the selection criteria for your level and major.
