Liz Alderman Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 ealderman@wpi.edu Liz Alderman Admissions Counselor I have lived in the Worcester area my whole life. I graduated from Keene State College in 2011 with a BA degree in Psychology and a minor in Holocaust and Genocide Studies. It was at Keene State that I worked as a Tour Guide and fell in love with admissions and everything about the process. After college graduation and working in the business world for several years, I realized that higher education in admissions was my calling! I love having the opportunity to meet with prospective WPI students and learn about their passion for our campus and curriculum. I love Disney everything and am a huge movie buff of all genres. I am so excited work at WPI and cannot wait to meet you all! Regional responsibilities: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia Kate Bellaud Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 kbellaud@wpi.edu Kate Bellaud Senior Assistant Director I grew up in Massachusetts, attended college in Vermont and love living in New England. I have spent over 15 years working in higher education with a specific focus on undergraduate admission. I find helping students and their families navigate the college admission process to be incredibly rewarding. I am constantly amazed by the students I meet and all of the creativity and leadership they demonstrate in and out of the classroom. My family moved to the Worcester area eight years ago and we really enjoy living here. There is so much to do for all ages.  While I love reading a good book and getting together with family and friends, time outside of work is typically spent helping my two boys with homework or taking them to the hockey rink. They enjoy visiting me on campus and talking about what their college experience might be like one day. Regional responsibilities: Massachusetts Julie Chapman Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 chapman@wpi.edu Julie Chapman Director of Admissions Outreach and Recruitment Originally from Westborough, MA, I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work from the University of New Hampshire. As a City Year Boston corps member and education volunteer at the New England Aquarium, I discovered I really enjoyed mentoring high school students as they began the college search process. I have been at WPI and lived in Worcester for over 10 years and have loved every minute of it. Worcester is a great college town! I'm a fan of the restaurants, the Hanover Theatre, the art museum, the Ecotarium, and the many state parks within a half hour from home. When I'm not hanging out in the Admissions Office, I'm probably still on campus with my little boys. Robots, rockets, video games, racecars, NASA events...they think WPI is the coolest place ever!  And I do too. Regional responsibilities: Georgia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee Jennifer Cluett Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 jcluett@wpi.edu Jennifer Cluett Interim Dean of Admissions Born in Texas, I grew up in Walpole, MA and graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME. I have been working in Admissions and Enrollment Management for the past 17 years - 16 of those with WPI. I always tell people I have the best job in the world - I get to work with a fabulous team of Admissions professionals, have the opportunity to interact with our engaged and innovative current students who seek to make the world a better place, and meet countless prospective students, parents and guidance counselors who want to learn more about WPI. In addition, I have the privilege of collaborating with faculty and staff across campus on special events, including serving as a liaison to NASA for the annual TouchTomorrow science festival, which draws 10,000 people to campus for a family friendly day of STEM hands on activities, demonstrations, presentations and exhibits. When I'm not at work, you are likely to find me at a soccer field, basketball court, softball diamond or dance studio where my three busy kids keep me on my toes! Donelle Durham Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 ddurham@wpi.edu Donelle Durham Assistant Director of Admissions Coordinator of Multicultural Recruitment Originally from the Southern region of the United States, college brought me here to the northeast and I've been making snow angels ever since! College admissions has always been a passion of mine as I stumbled through the process as a high school senior. I am now fortunate enough to be able to assist students like myself who are interested in obtaining a college degree and attending an institution that will leave a lasting impact on their lives. If you're like I was in high school, currently stumbling through the admissions process, feel free to send me an email for some help, I'd be happy to speak with you. Regional responsibilities: Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Puerto Rico, Texas, US Virgin Islands Adam Epstein '05 Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 adam@wpi.edu Adam Epstein '05 Associate Director of Admissions Class of 2005 I have worked in the Admissions Office since 2007 and earned both bachelor's and master's degrees from WPI. While my job focuses on working with students before arrival at WPI, my favorite time on campus is actually at graduation when we see the completion of their years of hard work. When not working you are likely to find me listening to Bruce Springsteen (usually while working too), watching Seinfeld or sports, running, or making spontaneous travel plans. Like XKCD? Me too (#214). Regional responsibilities: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, Wyoming Kaitlin Gentile Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 kait@wpi.edu Kaitlin Gentile Senior Assistant Director of Admissions Coordinator of Transfer Admissions I'm originally from Candia, NH and completed my Bachelor's degree in English at Providence College in 2003. With the goal of working in higher education, I completed my Master's degree in School Counseling at Rivier College in 2007. Though I come from a very different educational background than our applicants, I really enjoy working with the kinds of students who apply to WPI. When I'm not busy reading your applications, I'm trying to stay active. I'm an amateur runner, I've hiked 23 of the 67 "four thousand footers" in New England, I try to ski when I can, and I'm a Padi-certified scuba diver. But let's face it: when it's really cold outside, I'm often reading at home on the couch. Regional responsibilities: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island Transfer candidates: last names beginning A-L Karen Goudey Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 kgoudey@wpi.edu Karen Goudey Senior Associate Director of International Admissions I have worked in international student admissions for over 13 years. I've been at WPI since 2005 – and in the undergraduate admissions office since 2006. I hold a Master of Arts in Intercultural Relations from Lesley University and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and French Studies from Smith College. I've been lucky enough to spend three years living abroad – as a high school exchange student in Croatia (then Yugoslavia), on my junior year abroad in Geneva, and then a year after I graduated from college in Germany (the year the Wall came down!). I enjoy traveling to new places, meeting people, and trying all the wonderful kinds of food the world has to offer! When I'm not traveling, I love spending time with my family and friends – including our four-legged family members: two dogs, two cats, a bearded dragon and a ferret! Regional responsibilities: Asia, India, Middle East Eliza Laurent Contact Information Bartlett Center eliza@wpi.edu Eliza Laurent Senior Assistant Director of Admissions I came to the Admissions Office in 2009 after having worked in a corporate setting for nearly 4 years and I have never looked back. One of my favorite events on campus is Quadfest, when all of the students are enjoying the warm springtime weather. But when I am not on campus, I am outside doing something! Whether it is playing golf with my husband in the warm weather or playing paddle tennis with friends in the winter, New England is a wonderful place to be active no matter the season. Regional responsibilities: Massachusetts, New York Cortney Lima Contact Information Bartlett Center clima2@wpi.edu Cortney Lima Admissions Counselor I was born, raised, and currently live in Pawtucket, RI. I came to Worcester in 2009 where I attended Assumption College and graduated with a degree in Mathematics and a minor in Education. I can remember the college process as if it was yesterday. Since I was the first in my family to go and graduate from college, the process was new and exciting but also very challenging. From this experience and my involvement in admissions as an undergraduate, I knew admissions is where I wanted to be. If I am not at work, you can find me in a pool swimming, outside running or eating a delicious meal from one of the many restaurants in Worcester or Providence. Regional responsibilities: Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Wisconsin Julie Loveless Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 jloveless@wpi.edu Julie Loveless Senior Assistant Director of Admissions After growing up in Northampton, MA, and graduating from college in New Hampshire, I took a leap and moved to Asia to teach English. While there, I discovered that I love working with college students, so I came back to the States and counseled international students on the college admissions process. I wanted to see how admissions worked from the inside so I came to WPI, where I'm working with both international and domestic applicants. In my free time, I like to cook, garden, travel, camp, hike, or catch a concert. Regional responsibilities: District of Columbia, Guam, Maryland, Virginia, AE/AP/AA; Africa, Bangladesh, Canada, China, Caribbean, Europe, India, Latin America, Nepal, Pakistan Lynn McElholm Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 lmcelholm@wpi.edu Lynn McElholm Assistant Director of Admissions As a high school student growing up in central Massachusetts, I took part in many events at WPI and even presented my chemistry project here during a regional science fair. I am thrilled to be part of the WPI community now where I see firsthand how the students impact the health, happiness, and safety of our world. As a member of the Admissions team, I enjoy meeting high school students from all corners of the globe, and in particular from the areas I cover in Massachusetts. I graduated from Union College with a Bachelor’s degree in math and psychology.  My higher education career includes working at Babson College for nine years, where I earned my MBA. I have gained experience in navigating intercultural settings by traveling extensively, including exploring Southeast Asia and China for a year on my own. I have also lived overseas in Germany and England. My position at WPI includes managing undergraduate leadership programs, including the WPI Engineering Ambassador program. Through this outreach initiative, students inspire middle and high school students as well as prospective students and their families to see the amazing opportunities in STEM fields. Regional responsibilities: Massachusetts Jenna Noel-Grinshteyn Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 jnoel@wpi.edu Jenna Noel-Grinshteyn Coordinator of Admissions Outreach My background is in secondary education where I always loved the interaction with students in the middle and high school grades. I have been in the Admissions field for over 5 years. I am passionate about my work in higher education because we are able to teach and mentor students who are looking to continue their education after high school. Here at WPI, I am constantly amazed by what the students do academically as well as socially. I have a great view of campus where I can see all the activity happening on the quad from my office. Whether students are out playing frisbee, walking a tight rope, bouncing in a jumping house for charity, or just taking a few minutes out of the day to relax, it’s always great to see such vibrant life on campus. Regional responsibilities: Connecticut Stephanie Rudzinski Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 srudzinski@wpi.edu Stephanie Rudzinski Assistant Director of Admissions Born and raised in Lawrence, MA, I came to Worcester several years ago for college, intrigued by the many things the city has to offer. With all the museums, festivals, theatrical performances and sporting events, there certainly is plenty to do! I graduated with a degree in English from Assumption College in 2009 and have worked in admissions for the last few years. I absolutely love what I do. Working with students and their families through the college process is incredibly rewarding, and I am so impressed by everything our students are doing. When I am not in the office or traveling, you can find me exploring the many Worcester restaurants with my husband, playing with our dogs in several area parks, or exploring Mt. Wachusett. Worcester is a great place to be! Regional responsibilities: Delaware, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont Sue Sontgerath '88 Contact Information Bartlett Center Phone: +1-508-831-5286 ssont@wpi.edu Sue Sontgerath '88 Associate Director of Admissions and Coordinator of Pre-college Programs Class of 1988 I am originally from Western Massachusetts but now live in the Worcester area. I am a WPI alumna with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. I am currently working on a Master of Education degree at Worcester State University. While working as an engineer, I had some incredible opportunities which included working for companies that manufactured everything from space shuttle parts for NASA to carbineers for mountain climbing. After taking some time off to raise my children, I returned to WPI in 2008, which was bit like coming home for me.  I am very proud of the commitment WPI has made not only to a superb education for our current students, but also to educating younger K-12 students about the exciting opportunities in available in science and engineering. In my spare time, when I am not taxiing children to a sporting or school event, I love reading, hiking (especially in the awesome New England fall) or spending time on the Cape with my family.
