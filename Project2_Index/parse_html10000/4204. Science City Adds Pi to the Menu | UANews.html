Science City will pack the weekend of March 14 and 15 full of activities for science lovers of all ages. (Photo: Lynn Ketchum) A diverse, excitement-filled Science City lineup awaits visitors as the University of Arizona prepares to share science with the masses at the annual Tucson Festival of Books on March 14 and 15. Visitors to Science City will experience the connection between their daily lives and advances in science and learn about groundbreaking research being done at the UA. The Tucson Festival of Books is the fourth-largest book festival in the world, but it is the only one to incorporate science as a key component. The UA’s BIO5 Institute and College of Science are the co-hosts of Science City in association with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, in partnership with the Arizona SciTech Festival, and with the continued support of the primary sponsor, the Helios Education Foundation, and other valued community and business sponsors. Science City is the state's largest STEM event. Science City’s themed "neighborhoods" include the Science of Everyday Life, the Science of Tomorrow, the Science of You and the Science of the Natural World. Across these neighborhoods, 80 participating groups will feature engaging, hands-on activities and interactive demonstrations for science lovers of all ages to learn about innovations in health, science, engineering and technology. Faculty, students and volunteers from UA programs such as Biosphere 2; the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission; the Arizona Science of Baseball; Insect Discovery; Family and Consumer Sciences; Biomedical Engineering; Geosciences; the School of Mind, Brain and Behavior; Plant Sciences; the Arizona Genomics Institute; Planetary Science; the Office of Sustainability, and others will be on hand to share their passion for science. In addition to Science City’s four neighborhoods, this year also will feature a Science of Pi (π) zone in recognition of Super Pi Day — 3/14/15, the date that comes closest to the mathematical representation of pi (3.141592653 ...). A celebratory Super Pi kickoff activity will start at 9 a.m. on March 14. From robots and insects to explosive demonstrations to enriching tours and talks, Science City is filled with wonders. To start building your Science City 2015 must-see list, here are some suggestions: Get up close and personal with some of our friendly neighborhood wildlife friends at the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum Live Animal Show at 11:30 a.m. daily on the Science Stage. Experience the power of pi by maneuvering Buffon’s needles, a hands-on way to estimate pi by using just toothpicks and parallel lines, by making a visual representation of pi with colors or by designing your own bouncy ball in the Science of Pi neighborhood. Watch volcano eruption simulations (at 11 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m. daily) as demonstrated by the Geosciences Department. See the newly opened trilobite exhibit or a show in the new FullDome theater at the Flandrau Science Center and Planetarium. Meet a scientist at the Science Café, which will feature talks by world-class UA researchers on diverse topics including African rice, Jupiter’s moons, mountain women, aneurysms, DNA sequencing, wearable technology and game-based therapies, and innovative veterinary care. Make and launch your own bottle rocket. Enjoy yummy insects, mushrooms and other culinary "treats." Extract DNA at the BIO5 Institute  booth.   Get a scorpion tattoo at the VIPER Institute  booth. Eat ice cream made with liquid nitrogen at the Chemistry Club booth. See the largest museum insect collection in Arizona during tours Saturday at 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 and 3 p.m. Hear from two UA physicians, Dr. Peter Rhee and Dr. Richard Carmona, about prevention and innovation that can preserve health and extend human life at 2:30 p.m. Saturday on the Science Stage. ‪Share the excitement of discovering and following asteroids and learn about the upcoming OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory booth. UA open houses and tours that will run throughout the weekend include the Richard F. Caris Mirror Lab; the Flandrau Science Center and Planetarium, the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research; the Campus Arboretum; the Physics Department; the Insect Collection; the Museum of Natural History, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; and the Herbaria.
