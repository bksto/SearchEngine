Though raised by loving parents and supported by his four older siblings, he often feels like an outsider, and endures many painful episodes, some self-inflicted, in his struggle to understand his identity. Approved for Adoption poignantly traces one man’s interrogation of the definitions of ethnicity, culture, and the concept of “home.” Being a Man and Feminist Mini-Conference Thursday, March 12 | 8:30 am - 12:45 pm | USU Ballroom Being a Man and a Feminist acknowledges the need for engaged critical dialogue challenging racialized and gendered inequities in the classroom and on campus. Faculty, students and staff are invited to collectively identify new forms of masculinities in line with radical feminist praxis and generate ideas around alternative modes of teaching, knowing, and being in our immediate spaces.   © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
