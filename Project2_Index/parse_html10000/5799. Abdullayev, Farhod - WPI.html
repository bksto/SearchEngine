My area of research is Applied Analysis, with an emphasis on Partial Differential Equations, Calculus of Variations, and Applications to Material Science. I enjoy teaching and have been fortunate to be given multiple opportunities to teach a diverse array of courses, and to closely interact with students. I believe that a good teacher should have the ability to make use of a variety of different methods to motivate students to learn every single day, no matter how difficult the theoretical aspects of subject may be.
