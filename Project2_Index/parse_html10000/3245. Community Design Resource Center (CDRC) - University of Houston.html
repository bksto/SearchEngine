The Community Design Resource Center works to address issues of community development, design, planning, affordable housing and civic projects in partnership with communities. Since 2005, we have partnered with more than 15 community-based organizations, including the City of Houston, METRO and others. We have collaborated with more than 500 residents and stakeholders; engaged more than 100 students in community-based learning projects and provided 25 summer student internships. We have organized four public exhibits of design work and produced eight design publications in association with our projects. We completed the first Collaborative Community Design Initiative program in 2009 with partners in four communities for a year, providing comprehensive assistance with goal setting, visioning and implementation strategies. The Community Design Resource Center’s partnerships have significantly contributed to the public debate on the role of architecture and good design in catalyzing community change. As we move forward, we are designing new ways to engage our community partners and enhance the mutuality, reciprocity and impact of our lives.
