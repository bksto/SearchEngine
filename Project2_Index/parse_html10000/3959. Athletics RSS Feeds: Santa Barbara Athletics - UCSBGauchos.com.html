RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format for distributing and aggregating Web content (such as sports headlines). RSS feeds collect new content from the Web sites you visit most often and distributes it to your desktop, browser, or e-mail account. Through RSS feeds you can monitor news, blogs, and content for any personal and professional interest. With RSS, Web content comes to you as it is newly published on the Web rather than you needing to go looking for it.
