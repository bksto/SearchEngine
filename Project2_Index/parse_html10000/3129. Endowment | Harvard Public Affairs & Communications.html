In fiscal year 2012, distributions from the endowment contributed more than a third of the University's operating budget. Endowment income supports Harvard’s academic programs, science and medical research, and student financial aid programs. The endowment is not a single fund, but comprises more than 12,000 individual funds, many of them restricted to specific uses such as support of a research center or the creation of a professorship in a particular subject. The funds are invested by Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s endowment, trust funds, and other investments at a significant savings relative to outside management. The endowment’s total value is affected by several factors each year, including investment returns, new contributions, and the annual payout to support University programs and operations. Harvard’s annual financial reports are available here. Press releases about the endowment’s performance can be found below: 2014    2013    2012      2011      2010 In addition, a 2012 Q-and-A with Jane Mendillo, president and CEO of Harvard Management Company, can be found here.
