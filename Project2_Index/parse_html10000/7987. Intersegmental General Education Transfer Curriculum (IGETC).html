Students do not have to complete IGETC in order to be admitted to UCSB. If IGETC is not completed prior to transfer, or if you have not attempted IGETC, you must complete UCSB's General Education (GE) program to graduate from UCSB. It is not necessary to complete UCSB's GE prior to admission. Alternate ways to fulfill UCSB GE requirements are explained in the UCSB General Catalog.  Use of IGETC by College Transfers into the UCSB College of Letters and Science and College of Creative Studies may use IGETC to substitute for general education requirements. Transfers into the College of Engineering may also use IGETC to substitute for general education requirements. In addition to general education, all students in the College of Engineering are required to complete a depth requirement. Students who wish to satisfy the depth requirement prior to transfer must complete a year-long sequence in the history of world civilization, history of western civilization, history of western philosophy or history of western art. Students may want to choose courses for IGETC that will concurrently satisfy the depth requirement. After transfer, students may also complete the depth requirement with upper division coursework. PLEASE NOTE: Students planning to transfer into a major in engineering, computer science or the biological or physical sciences should prioritize completing lower division prerequisites over IGETC to ensure competitiveness for admission and make normal, timely progress through the major.
