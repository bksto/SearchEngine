The Stanford GSB Difference We develop leaders through each of our programs. We attract cutting-edge faculty. Our students are not afraid of making mistakes; they fear only missed opportunities. Our alumni are insightful, passionate professionals who are never satisfied with the status quo. Instead, they choose to employ their knowledge, talent, and ideas to create change. Your Stanford GSB experience will be like nobody else’s. And in the end both you, and your world, will be transformed. Access to Experts and Risk-Takers Students learn from our faculty, who are recognized experts in the global business community, and from business and world leaders who are invited to speak to classes and in larger settings. A Culture of Collaboration From group projects to student clubs to on-campus living, our culture reduces competition between students, encourages teamwork, and deepens relationships. Students have access to seven world-class schools on a single campus — business, earth sciences, education, engineering, law, medicine, and humanities and sciences — exposing them to more diversity, more ideas, and more inspiration. A Personalized Experience The entering class sizes in our programs are notably smaller than some other leading schools. This intimate class size supports individualized attention, allowing each student to shape the academic experience to suit his or her interests. Innovation in Our DNA Stanford University began with the pioneering spirit of Leland and Jane Stanford, then grew into a research university with a reputation as a catalyst for change. Drawing on the energy of Silicon Valley, one of the world’s most dynamic centers for business and innovation, students learn to try new ideas and not fear failure. Global Orientation Our faculty focus on the global context of management, and we train leaders for an international economy. We offer international study trips, internships, and programs around the world. A State-of-the-Art Facility Our home, the Knight Management Center, has been designed for the future, with an eye towards technology, innovation, collaboration, and sustainability. Under the sunny skies of the San Francisco Bay Area, there is no place quite like it. Alumni Network The intimate size of our programs means that relationships are strong and alumni can rely on support from each other long after they graduate.
