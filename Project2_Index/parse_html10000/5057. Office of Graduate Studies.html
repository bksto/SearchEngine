Now in its 6th year, Ghost Town is produced by graduate students in the Creative Writing program, under the guiding hand of English professor Chad Sweeney, the faculty editor. Putting together a literary journal is a monumental task: “The students read thousands of submissions of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, from around the world, and must select the best 100 pages or so to include in an issue,” Sweeney said. “This represents a tremendous amount of work, dialogue, talent and critical discernment.”   Past issues have featured pieces by such notable authors as Nobel Prize Judge and Swedish poet Kjell Espmark, and National Book Critics Circle Award winner Laura Kasischke. The current issue includes an interview with CSUSB’s own Isabel Quintero, a recent MFA program graduate and winner of the American Library Association’s "Morris Award" for best debut Young Adult Novel. Take some time to explore the pages of Ghost Town.     Disability Resources Privacy and Security Notice The California State University System Site Map Download:   Flash Player MS Office Viewers Acrobat Reader Quicktime Player California State University, San Bernardino 5500 University Parkway, San Bernardino CA 92407-2318 909-537-5000 Updated: June 29, 2011 Email Webmaster
