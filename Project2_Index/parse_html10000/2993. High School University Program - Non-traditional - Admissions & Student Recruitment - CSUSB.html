Students have the opportunity to experience life at a four-year university on a part-time basis while taking approved college courses convenient to their high school schedule during the traditional academic year. Please note: Due to impaction at CSUSB, the High School University Program will not be offered until further notice. This program is by no means an alternative to high school. Courses taken at Cal State San Bernardino by high school students are not to be used to make up any college admission deficiencies. This is strictly a tool for high school level juniors and seniors who have proven academically mature enough to succeed at the university level. Admission Requirements  Junior or senior standing at your high school A 3.0 (or higher) grade point average in college preparatory coursework beginning in the 10th grade Recommendation from your high school counselor or teacher (Official High School University Program Recommendation Form) Adequate high school preparation in prerequisite courses (where prerequisites apply) Approved Courses for Students in HSUP Students may register for courses numbered 100-299 (lower division, transferable) provided any prerequisites have been met.

Students must maintain good academic standing in order to continue enrollment in the program.
