Again! On January 7, 2015, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching announced that California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) is the recipient of the 2015 Community Engagement Classification, recognizing the institution’s commitment to engagement through teaching, research, service and partnerships.  As one of the elite institutions that initially received classification in 2006, CSUSM is now joined by 360 other colleges and universities in the United States to carry this prestigious distinction, which is valid through 2025. See the highlights of CSUSM's activities that merit such an honor.  Read the complete 2015 Application for Reclassification.  The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching is a national organization responsible for classifying all institutions of higher education.  The Carnegie Foundation began a Community Engagement Elective Classification in 2006.  Institutions were welcome to submit documentation for this evidence-based classification in two categories:  1) Curricular Engagement and 2) Outreach and Partnerships.  In 2006, CSUSM was one of 76 institutions in the country to achieve the elective classification, and one of 62 to receive classification in both categories.  Review the CSUSM 2006 Application for the Elective Classification in Community Engagement. DEFINITION OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT Community engagement describes collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. PURPOSE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT The purpose of community engagement is the partnership of college and university knowledge and resources with those of the public and private sectors to enrich scholarship, research, and creative activity; enhance curriculum, teaching and learning; prepare educated, engaged citizens; strengthen democratic values and civic responsibility; address critical societal issues; and contribute to the public good. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
