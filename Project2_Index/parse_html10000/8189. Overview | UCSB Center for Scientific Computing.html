The CSC already provides a broad range of resources for campus researchers, and we are expanding the available hardware with a recent NSF/MRI funded system. Beyond simply providing the computing resources themselves, part of our mission is to provide training in the best use of computing resources; whether they are at UCSB, or beyond. The CSC sponsors classes, tutorials, and individual training in general Unix/Linux, compiling, and optimization of codes. The CSC also actively engages IT staff at research units across campus so that researchers can get help from their local IT staff, who often understand best what they need to do their projects. Collaborations CSC partners with UCSB campus organizations and other universities to make available high performance computing resources to our researchers.
