I ran for the office of Chair of Academic Senate based on three sets of reasons. First, I ran for Senate Chair out of my long-standing commitment to shared governance. One of the fundamental characteristics that separate the university from other social organizations, whether corporations or kiva clans, is its emphasis on shared governance. The Academic Senate is central to shared governance, a form of governance in which faculty, administrators, staff and students chart the course of a university. As the most representative faculty body, the Academic Senate has a unique and central role within shared governance. However, shared governance only works if individuals are willing to share its demands and responsibilities with commitment and civility. This is my time to do this. Second, I ran for the Chair’s position because I wanted to encourage the notion that our University should be a place for intellectual fulfillment—for everyone who sets foot on this campus: administrators, faculty, students, staff, and members of the community. We give a great deal to this University, and I think all of us should gain some intellectual fulfillment in return. This should be more than just the place where we do our jobs. Third, I ran for the Chair’s position because I am absolutely committed to current initiatives to enhance student success. I think the issues surrounding “student success” require an “all hands on deck approach” because the problems are so complex and the remedies so diverse. I do not want to see “student success” reduced to meaningless metrics. If we had a 95% four year graduation rate, we should still be concerned with student success. As Chair of the CSUDH Academic Senate I am will do everything I can to advance shared governance, to support the intellectual role of the university, and to improve the educational opportunities for CSUDH students. I look forward to serving you. Jerry D.
