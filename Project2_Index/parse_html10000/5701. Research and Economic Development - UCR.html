A revised version of the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide has been posted to the NSF website and is available electronically at: http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=grantsgovguide1214. Please refer to Page 2 of the Guide for a summary of the significant changes, clarifications and other changes.  This document is applicable to all applications submitted, or due, to NSF on or after December 26, 2014.  Any questions regarding the new Guide should be submitted electronically to policy@nsf.gov. OMB Uniform Guidance UNIFORM GUIDANCE On December 26, 2013, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published, in the Federal Register, the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards; Final Rule, 2 CFR Chapter I, Chapter II, Part 200 ("Uniform Guidance") .  The Uniform Guidance was part of a major reform initiative of the federal government to streamline the process for making and monitoring assistance awards (grants and cooperative agreements), and to reduce the administrative burden while increasing accountability and transparency in federal awards management.  Such guidance consolidated and replaced eight (8) separate OMB Circulars, including A-110 (Administrative Requirements), A-21 (Cost Principles), and A-133 (Audit Requirements), into a single document and has changed some fundamental concepts underlying the management of sponsored programs. Federal agencies (e.g., DOE, NIH, NSF, USDA, etc.) were required to develop their own agency-specific policies that conform to the Uniform Guidance while non-federal institutions (including the University of California), had to assess their policies and processes to ensure compliance with the Uniform Guidance and agency-specific policies.  The Research Policy Analysis and Coordination office in the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) has launched a new web page to centralize information on the OMB Uniform Guidance.  A UC system-wide working group, comprised of Office of the President and campus experts from the functional areas affected by the implementation of the Uniform Guidance, actively assessed the impact of the new regulations on existing UC policies and processes, and issued the Uniform Guidance Workgroup Assessment Report to the campuses on December 5, 2014.  Such report provides an outline of actions that UCOP and the campuses will need to take to comply with the new standards.  As that working group continues with its implementation of the UCOP action items identified in the assessment report, information and resources will be posted to their site.  UCR also established a campus-wide working group to assess the impact of the new regulations on existing UCR policies and processes.  An overview of their assessment was presented at the UCR C&G User's Group Meeting on January 29, 2015 focusing on What the PI Needs to Know.  It is anticipated that a subsequent town hall meeting for faculty will be scheduled in Spring 2015.  Questions and comments may be emailed to ug@ucr.edu.  The UCR working group may utilize some of those inquiries in the development of a campus-wide Frequently Asked Questions document.   RESOURCES: The Council on Financial Assistance Reform (COFAR) held extensive training webcasts on the major updates to OMB's Uniform Guidance, and recordings of those webcasts are now available.  Links to COFAR's Uniform Guidance Training webcasts held on January 27, 2014: COFAR Training Intro (http://youtu.be/SOET4b-7my8 ) - 11 Minutes    COFAR Training Administrative Requirements (http://youtu.be/BP3l3PjI1JQ ) - 85 minutes    COFAR Training Cost Principles (http://youtu.be/q0rWXdy2ICM ) - 35 minutes    COFAR Training Audit Requirements (http://youtu.be/g-U8HGbbC-Y ) - 50 minutes  Links to the January 27, 2014 Training Webcast Presentation Slides: COFAR Training Administrative Requirements 1-27-14 Slides  COFAR Training Cost Principles 1-27-14 Slides COFAR Training Audit Requirements 1-27-14 Slides Additional links to various Uniform Grant Guidance materials: Improving Outcomes by Reducing Red Tape for Financial Assistance PART 200-UNIFORM ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS, COST PRINCIPLES, AND AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL AWARDS Uniform Grant Guidance Crosswalks and Side-by-Sides  -- (This is a very useful tool.)

NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG), NSF 15-1, has been issued. This new version of the PAPPG will be effective for proposals submitted, or due, on or after December 26, 2014. In the interim, the guidelines contained in the current PAPPG (NSF 14-1) continue to apply. A webinar to brief the community on the new PAPPG will be held on January 15, 2015, from 11 AM - Noon, in Winston Chung Hall, Rooms 205/206. Read More UPDATE: On Dec. 26, 2014, NSF's Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide for principal investigators (PIs) will be updated to include the following statement: "Should a proposal be recommended for award, the PI may be contacted by the NSF Program Officer for assistance in preparation of the public award abstract and its title. An NSF award abstract, with its title, is an NSF document that describes the project and justifies the expenditure of Federal funds." Such update stems from NSF's new approach to transparency and accountability practices.

NIH has removed the requirement to identify 'substantial scientific changes' in the text of a Resubmission application by 'bracketing, indenting, or change of typography'. Effective immediately, it is sufficient to outline the changes made to the Resubmission application in the Introduction attachment. The Introduction must include a summary of substantial additions, deletions, and changes to the application. It must also include a response to weaknesses raised in the Summary Statement. The page limit for the Introduction may not exceed one page unless indicated otherwise in the Table of Page Limits. Reminder for the Extramural Scientific Community: Implementation of the Genomic Data Sharing Policy Begins January 25, 2015 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy ( NOT-OD-14-124) and Implementation of the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy for NIH Grant Applications and Awards (NOT-OD-14-111) on August 27, 2014. Both announcements specified the effective implementation date of January 25, 2015, for NIH grant application submissions.
