How to Be a Successful Online Learner Are you prepared to take an online course? Being a successful online student requires independence, discipline and self-motivation. Ensure you're prepared with these tips: Be an independent and self-motivated learner. Adhere to the UC Berkeley Honor Code and maintain your academic integrity. Have access to a computer with a fast, reliable Internet connection and adequate updated software (Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer browser, QuickTime). View the technical requirements. Know how to perform basic computer functions (saving and attaching files, creating folders) and navigate the Internet (using search engines, entering passwords). Be able to communicate effectively and clearly using email and an online discussion board to work on assignments with students who may be in different time zones. For students whose native language is not English, it is recommended that you have achieved a minimum level of English proficiency. You do not need to submit test scores. However, we encourage students to be aware of their own language proficiency. For example, students who achieve a minimum TOEFL score of 80 iBT, a minimum IELTS score of 6.5, or have previously taken and successfully completed courses taught in English may be more confident in their ability to succeed in a UC Berkeley Extension course. Be disciplined in setting and maintaining a schedule to complete your work and provide timely responses to other students and the instructor, even when there are distractions online (checking personal email, perusing social media) or at home (television, family, social activities). Have a study room that is free from distractions. Be comfortable being online several times a week to participate in your course. Be proactive in asking appropriate questions when assignments, concepts or homework solutions are unclear.
