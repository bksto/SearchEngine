The fulfillment of this promise will be determined, however, by the choices researchers and scholars make today about where and how they publish. This page outlines some of the issues related to disseminating eScholarship; identifies ways faculty can effectively manage the rights to and dissemination of their work; and describes resources and services available to the UIC community for managing, sharing, promoting, and measuring impact of scholarship and the underlying data.
