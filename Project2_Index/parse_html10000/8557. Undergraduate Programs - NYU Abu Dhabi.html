Over the course of four years of undergraduate study, students will have an extensive choice of courses in all disciplines and be able to fulfill all requirements. English is the language of instruction. Mastery of English is expected for admission, but non-credit classes for advanced training in spoken and written English are offered. Courseload & GPA Courseload and GPA for the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees ask students to complete courses in their major, the core curriculum, and in a variety of electives. Core Curriculum The core curriculum is organized into four areas: Pathways of World Literature; Structures of Thought and Society; Art, Technology, and Invention; and Ideas and Methods of Science. Majors Students in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences declare their majors no later than the fourth semester. Science and Engineering students normally begin the foundational course in their majors during the first year. Students enjoying Marhaba Week at NYUAD. Concentrations Concentrations allow students to study subjects of interest that complement their major area of study, or pursue subjects that are of personal interest. Concentrations are not required for the completion of the degree. January Term Students take one full-time course for three weeks in January. The courses are designed as immersive experiences: they intensify the student's focus, reach beyond the classroom, and facilitate study at NYU's global sites. Language Language is the principal means through which humans communicate and a major vehicle in the development of thought, culture, and aesthetic expressions. Capstone Project The Capstone project is a demanding, year-long endeavor aiming at a significant piece of research or creative work — a historical narrative, musical composition, performance, invention, documented experiment, scholarly thesis, or other form appropriate to the student's goals. Each major and multidisciplinary concentration describes its own Capstone project; requirements vary by program. Courses From 19th- and 20th-century European Philosophy and Foundations of Science to Making Theater and Political Psychology, NYUAD offers a vast array of undergraduate courses.   Graduation Requirements In order to graduate from NYU Abu Dhabi, students must complete 140 credit hours, eight core curriculum courses — including at least one writing-intensive core course, most of which should be taken in the first two years — an academic major, two seven-week physical education activities, an Islamic studies requirement, and a Capstone project, all the while maintaining a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0. I thought, wow, I’m almost nothing compared to the vast stretch of nature that lies ahead of me. Yet at the same time, I have consciousness, I can find meaning in all of this.
