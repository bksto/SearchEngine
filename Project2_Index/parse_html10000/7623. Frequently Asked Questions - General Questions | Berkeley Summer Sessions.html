What is there to do during my free time? How do I get around town?   Where is the Berkeley Summer Sessions office located? 1995 University Avenue, Suite 130 Berkeley CA 94704 Campus Map   What is there to do during my free time? The San Francisco Bay Area is a world-class tourist destination, and the recreational and tourist activities in the Bay Area are unparalleled. It's a wonderful place to be for the summer, but you really have to work hard on your class days in order to enjoy a carefree weekend. Berkeley is generally considered to be in the "East Bay" area of the San Francisco Bay Area, so if you want to stay nearby, look for events and activities in the East Bay. Here are some links to local recreational and tourist activities - but there are a lot more out there for you to find out on your own!   How do I get around town? See our page on "Bay Area Public Transportation". © UC Berkeley Summer Sessions, 1995 University Avenue 510-642-5611 SSALL Contact Donate to BSS
