We create a dynamic living/learning experience that promotes and inspires individuals to become empowered community members. Living on campus is an important part of the college experience. Studies show that students who live on campus make better grades, are more involved in campus activities, and are less likely to drop out of college. These somewhat surprising statements have been documented in several independent studies conducted by professional educators over the past few years. We offer a residence hall system with a sound academic and social atmosphere. Each residence hall provides facilities to satisfy the daily needs of our students. First Year Residential Experience The FYRE program is designed to assist in students' transition from high school to college by encouraging a connection with the University through academics, campus activities, residence hall programs, and other events that enrich the college experience.
