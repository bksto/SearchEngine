Home Dean's Message Building The Campaign Opportunities Construction                           INNOVATIVE • STATE - OF - THE - ART • INTERPROFESSIONAL • THE FUTURE: These are just a few of the words being used to describe a unique health care education and research facility being built at 433 First Avenue and 26th Street, in the heart of the NYU health sciences corridor in Manhattan. When the building opens in 2015, students, faculty, and researchers will benefit from an impressive 170,000 square-foot complex designed specifically to create a 21st century interprofessional urban teaching/learning/research community. The vision is to create an environment that will build academic bridges; promote interaction among nursing, dental, and bioengineering students; and promulgate a new model of education, health care delivery, and scientific partnership. In classrooms, laboratories, offices, lecture halls and a technology-rich Learning Commons, students and colleagues from across disciplines will come together to teach, to learn, and to explore exciting new opportunities. Alumni, parents and friends will attend open houses, lectures, tours and gatherings.  Our new building will provide opportunities to meet our students and faculty and to become immersed in a place we all call home: NYU College of Nursing. Letter from the Dean Dear Friend of NYU College of Nursing: It is with great pleasure that I introduce you to the future home of NYU College of Nursing! This stunning new building, under construction at 433 First Avenue, will be a national and international hub for nursing research, education and practice and the first true home for the College of Nursing since it was founded 80 years ago. Its premier location, on First Avenue and 26th Street, one of the busiest and best-known centers for health care and research in the world. When I assumed the deanship of NYU College of Nursing, I heard a recurring theme from our faculty, students, and alumni: we are so excited about the new building! Why? Because our move to this facility recognizes and validates our rising national and international stature as a top-rated nursing institution and is a landmark event in the College’s history, a realization of the vision for nursing at NYU developed and advanced by our predecessors. Our new home was designed by nurses, for nurses, and for the future of nursing education. It will bring us closer together, solidify our community, and be a launch pad for our dreams. We are building our future. I hope you will join us! With all best wishes, Eileen M. Sullivan-Marx, PhD, RN, FAAN Dean & Erline Perkins McGriff Professor Our Future Home From lecture halls to the cutting-edge Clinical Simulation Learning Center, and a state-of-the-art Learning Commons, the building will bring nursing students, faculty, researchers, and staff under one roof for the first time in the College’s history. The collaborative learning environment for which the College is so well-known will truly flourish in this welcoming and dynamic setting, benefitting everyone who enters the building to learn, to teach, or to work.   For more information about The Campaign, contact Larry Siegel at 212-998-6794 or larry.siegel@nyu.edu The Campaign To help fund the construction of its new home, the College has undertaken its most ambitious fundraising campaign to date, spearheaded by an energetic Board of Advisors. The Board has also formed a Campaign Committee composed of leaders in health care, education, and business. "Our vision is to take nursing at NYU to its highest level ever, so it seems only fitting that we keep our building campaign goals at the highest level as well. To achieve these goals, we will need our friends and alumni to join us as partners in this extraordinary journey. After all, home is where the heart is, and this building will be the beating heart of nursing at NYU for generations to come."  Judi Haber, PhD, APRN, BC, FAAN Associate Dean of Graduate Programs "I am very committed to the Campaign for Nursing and have chosen to take on a leadership role in this project because I believe NYU College of Nursing graduates some of the most outstanding nurses in the country. The College needs a space that can keep pace with this institution that is growing by leaps and bounds. A space that is modern and user-friendly, and that reflects the collaborative nature of the profession. I am delighted to be a part of this effort to create such a resource for NYU, and for the future of nursing."

The Alumni Lecture Hall is a centerpiece and one of the two largest classroom spaces in the new building - seating up to 160 people. "It is a state-of-the-art learning environment for students and faculty at the college," says Ann Marie Mauro, PhD '98, co-chair of the Alumni Lecture Hall fundraising committee. "As alumni, we have all benefitted from the history and legacy of being an NYU nurse, and now it's our turn to give back to the College's current and future nursing students." One of the chief ways in which alumni are carving their memories into the new building is by naming seats in the hall in honor or memory of a nursing mentor or family member. "As both an alumna and a person involved in this campaign, I feel that the Alumni Lecture Hall is about memorializing and noting the contributions of people who make significant differences in our lives as students, faculty, nurses, and family. It is not just a fundraiser but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have a say in how important figures in our lives are remembered," adds Madeline Naegle, PhD '80, MA '67, who co-chairs the Alumni Lecture Hall fundraising campaign with Mauro.
