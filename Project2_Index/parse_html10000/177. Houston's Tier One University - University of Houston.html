Not only did Tier One status verify the university’s excellence, it also helped reap economic and educational benefits for the city, the region and the state. The University of Houston alone generates over $3 billion for the city of Houston every year. Simply put, when the city of Houston’s namesake university does well, so does the city of Houston. The achievement was momentous, and arrived more quickly than almost any of us imagined. The city of Houston continues to evolve at a faster pace than other cities in America. As Houston’s namesake university we must keep pace with the momentum of the city. There is still room for growth to solidify our place among nationally competitive research universities, including broadening our overall excellence and strengthening our performance and reputation for student success. We are firmly committed to achieving those goals, and transforming the University of Houston into the Tier One university that Houston deserves.
