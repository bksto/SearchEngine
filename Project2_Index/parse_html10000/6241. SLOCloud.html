The project only had a front end demo with no back end available when we started, but the idea of simple SLO reporting really resonated with Crafton Hills College (CHC) and San Bernardino Valley College (SBVC). CHC is currently using it for SLO entry and SBVC is presenting it to faculty. Demos! A functional demo of our version of SLOCloud is available. There is the simple configuration which is designed for SBVC and the rubric configuration in use by CHC. Additional Features/Changes We added the following features/made the following changes: Backed by MSSQL using PDO Written to work on PHP 5.6 All SLOs exportable to CSV Two different SLO models to choose from Simple - very similar to the original Rubric - uses a 4 level rubric to score each SLO statement Ability to add more SLO models should the need arise Mapping of SLOs to Program Learning Outcomes (PLO), Institution Learning Outcomes (ILO) (Core Competencies (CC) for Simple), and General Education Outcomes (GEO) (Rubric only). Summary report for ILOs/CCs/GEOs. Ability to securely login via an LDAP account (not enabled in demo) Emails a copy of the SLO to the submitter when secured with LDAP (not enabled in demo) Ability to single signon with WebAdvisor (specially designed for SBCCD) Responsive for tablet resolutions and above Removed the MVPReady theme that is no longer free and went back to vanilla Bootstrap Future Plans Future changes may include: Ability to input SAOs Manage SLO Statement, PLO, ILO, CC, and GEO data via the web Extend to per student SLOs (per recent Accreditation change) Software Used The following open source software is used in this version of SLOCloud: Front End Bootstrap console-polyfill Font Awesome Handlebars.js jQuery jquery.scrollTo JSNLog Ladda Moment.js Back End Assetic fxmlrpc Less.php Medoo Monolog Twig Slim Framework Swift Mailer Phinx Contacts You can contact the developer Jason Brady at jbrady@sbccd.org or (909) 384-8691.
