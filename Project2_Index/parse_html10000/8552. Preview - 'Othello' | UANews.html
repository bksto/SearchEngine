The play centers on Othello, the Moorish General, whose valiant exploits have saved the state and won him the love of Desdemona, who defies social convention and her father's will to marry him. But Othello's ensign, Iago, harbors a secret resentment and plants the seed that will destroy Othello's love. Featuring some of Shakespeare's most beautiful poetry, "Othello" tells a timeless, tragic tale of love, deceit, jealousy and murder.
