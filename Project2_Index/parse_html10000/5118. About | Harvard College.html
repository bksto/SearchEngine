With world-class faculty, a dedication to affordability, and groundbreaking research opportunities, committed scholars have all the resources they need to fulfill their academic and personal potential. Teaching and research are intertwined at Harvard College—students contribute to research in labs and libraries and learn from faculty of the highest caliber. The breadth and depth of Harvard’s resources, from library and museum collections to engagement in the arts and athletics, remain unparalleled in higher education. At the heart of Harvard College are the Harvard Houses, where three-fourths of students live, learn, and work together with faculty, students, and graduate students. These multigenerational communities provide personal and enriching interactions that shape students both intellectually and socially, while providing a supportive and manageably-sized home inside a larger College and University. With a 375-year tradition of educating leaders in every endeavor, Harvard College is proud to deliver an education focused on both knowing and doing, on individual achievement and on meaningful collaboration in a supportive environment that fosters intellectual risk-taking. Situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard is one of more than 50 local institutions serving more than 200,000 students—making the Boston area America’s premier “college town.” Yet with an intellectually stimulating environment that is steeped in tradition, Harvard is unlike anywhere else in the world. Messages from the Dean “We want to ensure we are providing students a deeply transformative experience – intellectually, socially and personally – that will prepare them for a life of service and leadership. Harvard College should and will set the standard for liberal arts and sciences education for the next hundred years. This is who we are. Our students leave here and exert ripples across the world.” – Rakesh Khurana Dean of Harvard College See all messages Upcoming Events Brain Imaging Research Study of Hearing and Tinnitus Sunday, March 8, 2015 (All day) W.
