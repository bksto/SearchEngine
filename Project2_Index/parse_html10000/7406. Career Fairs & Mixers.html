Parking/Directions Directions to the University of Houston can be found at http://www.uh.edu/wtsc_apps/uh_maps/. Our experience has been that mapquest is not terribly reliable in getting people to campus, so please use our directions. In order to provide more flexibility and lower registration fees to career fair participants, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO VALIDATE PARKING. There are two parking garages that you may utilize for the event. Please note the garages are listed in the order of their parking space availability. Therefore, please utilize the East garage first, followed by the Welcome Center garage. Parking spaces are first-come, first-served and carpooling is encouraged. If you have not shipped your items prior to the career fair, we encourage you to drop off your materials at the UH Hilton FIRST before parking your vehicle. East Parking Garage Take 1-45 South (Downtown) Exit Cullen Street. Stay on the I-45 south feeder road. Once you cross over Elgin, continue going straight. You will see the East Parking Garage up on your right. Make a right into the first inlet by the East Parking Garage and then a sharp left. The entry to the visitor parking section of the East Parking Garage is on your right before you reach the stop sign. Please take a ticket from the ticket booth and pull forward to park on the first level.   After exiting your vehicle, please proceed to the Southeast Entrance of the East parking garage (the side that faces University Drive and the UH Recreation and Wellness Center) where a shuttle service will be waiting to take you to the UH Hilton. The shuttle service will begin running at 10:00am and operate continuously throughout the day until 5 p.m. Please note that a career fair volunteer will be stationed on the shuttle bus to assist you with your booth items. Welcome Center Parking Garage Take I-45 south to Spur 5. Take the access road to the first light, which is University Drive. Take a right on University. Stay in the left-hand lane and make a left onto Calhoun. Immediately to the right, you will see the entrance (http://www.uh.edu/plantops/pts/pts.html). Park in the parking garage and hold on to your parking ticket as you will need your parking ticket to exit the garage at the end of the day (visitor parking is available on floors three and four). For exiting the parking garage, you can pay as you exit with a credit card, or you can pay with cash and/or credit card at the designated kiosk on each floor.
