Dues are used to support membership programs and activities and provide scholarships and awards to Cal State Fullerton students. I became a lifetime Alumni Association member several years ago. What does that mean for me now? Don't you fret! We will "grandfather" all Lifetime Members into our new program and they will receive all Alumni Association benefits. We hope, however, that our "senior" Lifetime Members might want to reinvest their interest in the Alumni Association and be involved in our newer alumni activities. If you are a former Lifetime Member, please call Alumni Relations at 657-278-2586 so we know you would still like to be involved. What are Alumni Association Chapters? One of the most important benefits a university can offer its graduates is a strong alumni network. Because we know how important networking is to building your career, the CSUF Alumni Association is in the process of organizing alumni chapters.
