Sacramento State has put out the welcome mat for bike commuters with a network of bicycle pathways marked in bright green paint. Sacramento State is committed to smart sustainability practices and encourages students, faculty and staff to ride, rather than drive, to campus.  We want the University to be a safe place for everyone. If you do ride, please obey posted signage, slow down and consider wearing a helmet. Lock up your bike in a designated spot - and walk to class as if you'd arrived in a car.
