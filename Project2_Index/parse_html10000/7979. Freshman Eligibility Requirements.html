Attaining eligibility is an important first step in gaining admission to the university, though eligibility alone will not assure admission to UC Santa Barbara. For information on important selection criteria, visit the Freshman Selection page. Subject Requirement Students must successfully complete UC-approved courses in these 'a-g' subject areas with a 'C' grade or better. Be sure that the classes you take are on your school’s UC CERTIFIED COURSE LIST. Obtain your school’s list from your counselor, or visit the UCOP Doorways website. Course Content Course Requirement a. History or social science Must include U.S. history and world history/cultures/geography 2 years required b. College-preparatory English College-preparatory composition or literature 4 years required c. Mathematics At minimum: elementary algebra, geometry and advanced algebra 3 years required, 4 years recommended d. Laboratory science Must include two of these three areas: biology, chemistry and physics 2 years required, 3 years recommended e. Language other than English Must have two years of the same language 2 years required, 3 years recommended f.

College-preparatory elective(s) One year in addition to those required from "a-f" categories 1 year required Note: For online coursework, please refer to the UC list of Approved Online Course Providers. Grade Point Requirement Students must earn a minimum GPA of 3.0 (3.4 for non-California residents) in all a-g courses above. Only the grades you earn in "a-g" subjects in the tenth and eleventh grades – including summer sessions – are used to calculate your preliminary GPA. Courses you took in the ninth and twelfth grades can be used to meet "a-g" Subject Requirements if you earned a grade of C or better, but they will not be used to calculate your GPA. Examination Requirement All applicants must submit scores from the ACT Assessment plus Writing or the SAT Reasoning Test. UC no longer requires SAT subject tests, but certain programs on some campuses recommend them and you can use subject tests to satisfy the "a-g" requirements listed above. Specifically, at UCSB the College of Creative Studies recommends a SAT subject test related to an applicant’s chosen major. The College of Engineering recommends that all applicants take the Math 2 subject test. Minimum Eligibility vs. Selection While attaining minimum eligibility is an important first step in gaining admission to the University, minimum eligibility does not assure admission to your first choice campus. When UCSB cannot admit all eligible applicants, as has been the case among many UC campuses in recent years, we use standards to select students that are more competitive than the minimum requirements. These standards, which the university calls selection criteria, identify students who have demonstrated the capacity for high academic achievement and promise, and who have a variety of other qualities that can contribute to the strength and diversity of the campus community. Visit the Freshman Selection page to find out more. UCSB Supplemental Applications Certain departments at UC Santa Barbara require a supplemental application in addition to the University of California application, in which you select UCSB as a campus of choice. College of Creative Studies Applicants to the College of Creative Studies must submit an additional application and supplementary materials directly to the College. Although no additional fee is required to apply, admission to the College of Creative Studies is contingent upon receiving an admission offer from UCSB. Students may also apply to the college once admitted to UCSB. If you need the CCS application mailed to you, please contact the College by email at info@ccs.ucsb.edu.
