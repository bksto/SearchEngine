In a videotaped message played at the kickoff event to mark the start of the campaign's public phase, he talked about the campus that he holds dear, and his role in the campaign. "This is a time of unprecedented change and opportunity for UC Santa Barbara," said Douglas. "It's also a time of great excitement and anticipation, as the campus marshals resources to capitalize on the vibrant intellectual assets and extraordinary potential that distinguish it. Building on the tremendous momentum created this past decade under Chancellor Henry Yang's leadership, it is private support that will provide the critical margin of excellence to achieve our potential as a world-class university. "As alumni and friends of this university, we all have a role to play as ambassadors for UCSB. I've made a commitment to help, and I sincerely hope you'll join me and other leaders of this effort through your contributions of time and energy as well as financial support. My hope is that everyone will lead by example." Douglas has made several gifts to the Campaign, including a $1 million contribution toward construction of the new Carsey-Wolf Center, as well as a $500,000 gift to establish an endowed chair for the Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts in the College of Letters and Science. In recognition of the Carsey-Wolf Center gift, the lobby of the center's Pollock Theater is named in his honor. He is a member of the center's distinguished advisory board. "I have watched UCSB become an international leader in education, and as an alumnus and benefactor, I have the personal satisfaction of having played a part in that transformation," said Douglas. "This exciting center, with its public film theater, represents the very best in teaching, research and public service that a campus can offer." The new privately funded Pollock Theater allows students and scholars from a variety of disciplines to study everything from silent films to the latest in digital media and satellite communications. The center's state-of-the-art facilities and equipment enhance undergraduate and graduate education, promote interdisciplinary research, and serve the community with a public theater (paid for with a generous campaign gift from Joe and Helene Pollock and their family).
