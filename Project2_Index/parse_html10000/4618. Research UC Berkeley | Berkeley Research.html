More Data Science As the world becomes increasingly digital, new approaches to aggregating and analyzing data will bring huge benefits to fields as diverse as health care, astrophysics, genetics, business and public policy. Berkeley researchers lead the way in the "data science" that will accelerate scientific discovery.  More International & Area Studies Exploring the world and tackling global problems have long been a key part of UC Berkeley’s traditions. A vast number of international programs ranging from study abroad opportunities to large-scale global research collaborations facilitate the work of our faculty and students. More Innovation/Entrepreneurship UC Berkeley has a long legacy of innovations and leaders that have created groundbreaking products, revolutionary companies, and entirely new industries. The university plays a critical role in California’s economy and the contributions of our entrepreneurs have a global reach. More Excellence in Research UC Berkeley’s world-class faculty and researchers are changing the way we understand and interact with the world. More Berkeley Research in the News More news March 2, 2015 Anxious people more apt to make bad decisions amid uncertainty Highly anxious people have more trouble deciding how best to handle life’s uncertainties. Investigating this dynamic, scientists have found evidence of a glitch in the brain’s higher-order decision-making circuitry that could eventually be targeted in the treatment of anxiety disorders. More February 27, 2015 First Detailed Microscopy Evidence of Bacteria at the Lower Size Limit of Life Scientists have captured the first detailed microscopy images of ultra-small bacteria that are believed to be about as small as life can get. The research was led by scientists from Berkeley Laboratory and UC Berkeley. More February 25, 2015 Study IDs key birds that host Lyme disease bacteria in California A new UC Berkeley-led study has found that birds are more important than previously recognized as hosts for Lyme disease-causing bacteria in California.  More Berkeley Research in Numbers Berkeley ranks first among U.S. universities in the number of highly ranked graduate programs. In a report published in September 2010, the National Research Council (NRC) placed 48 out of 52 ranked UC Berkeley doctoral programs within the top 10 nationally. This compared to 46 of 52 programs for Harvard University, which came in second, and 40 of 59 programs for UCLA, in third place. Among its current faculty are: 8 Nobel laureates 141 members of the National Academy of Sciences  96 members of the National Academy of Engineering  10 recipients of the National Medal of Science 230 Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2013/14 Research Funding by Sponsor (in millions)   Each year, the Berkeley campus receives well over one-half billion dollars in research support from external sources.
