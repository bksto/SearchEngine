Times Book Prize announcement 50 finalists are announced for the L.A. Times Book Prizes The 35th annual L.A. Times Book Prizes are announced today. There are five finalists in 10 categories, and two prize winners were revealed: The Robert Kirsch Award for Lifetime Achievement will be presented to author T.C. Boyle, and LeVar Burton will be honored with the Innovators Award for inspiring generations of readers with Reading Rainbow. The awards will be presented Saturday, April 18, in conjunction with the L.A. Times Festival of Books April 18-19. LeVar Burton Bret Hartman / For The Times LeVar Burton will receive the L.A. Times Innovators Award for his work with Reading Rainbow. LeVar Burton will receive the L.A. Times Innovators Award for his work with Reading Rainbow. (Bret Hartman / For The Times) Boyle, a novelist and short story writer, is one of the West’s most prominent authors. His latest novel, out this month, is “The Harder They Come”; his books include “The Women,” “Drop City,” “The Tortilla Curtain,” “East Is East” and “The Road to Wellville.” Born and raised in New York and a graduate of the Iowa Writers Workshop, Boyle is the recipient of numerous national and international literary prizes. He was a key figure in establishing the creative writing department at USC, where he has taught since 1978. “T.C. Boyle has had a long-standing presence as both a writer and a teacher in the Southern California literary world,” L.A. Times book critic David L. Ulin said in a release announcing the award. “His stature within our community is unique, from the breadth of his novels and stories to his engagement with his students and role as a mentor.” Burton will receive the Innovators Award for his work with Reading Rainbow. The actor hosted and created the television show, which broadcast on PBS for more than two decades; after the show ended, he worked to secure the rights so he could create an app and school program to reach new generations of beginning readers. A wildly successful Kickstarter campaign to bring Reading Rainbow to disadvantaged students raised more than $5 million from more than 100,000 donors. lRelated Jacket Copy Steve Martin joins 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' adaptationSee all related 8 Finalists for 10 categories of prizes were announced: biography, current interest, fiction, graphic novel, history, mystery/thriller, poetry, science and technology, the Art Seidenbaum award for first fiction, and young adult literature.

Books 'Prudence' a heartbreaking tale of love, loss and desire We tend to talk about stories as if they're straight lines, routes from one point to another, with a beginning, middle and end.
