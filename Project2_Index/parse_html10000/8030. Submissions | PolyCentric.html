To get started, our staff will ask for the journalism basics: who, what, where, when, why and how. Providing this information allows our staff to better understand the scope of the news story and determine the next steps. Achievements Faculty, staff and students are welcome to submit their professional achievements and activities to polycentric@csupomona.edu. These may include a recent award, publication in a journal, conference presentations, or a new position in a professional organization. Again, providing the journalism basics (who, what, where, when, why and how) will help us get started. Announcements in PolyCentric and PolyUpdates Send an email to polyupdates@csupomona.edu with a brief (two or three sentences) description. Be sure to include a contact phone number and/or website. Announcements will also appear in PolyUpdates, the weekly email to faculty and staff. Send in items at least a week in advance of when they should be published. We may edit submissions for style and clarity. Events Calendar (Master Calendar) If you’re organizing an event on campus, make sure it is submitted to the Events Calendar (also called Master Calendar). The featured events are listed in PolyCentric. Social Media Public Affairs manages the university’s official social media accounts on Facebook, Google+ and Twitter. We partner with MediaVision in managing the university YouTube channel. Alumni Affairs hosts the campus’s LinkedIn group. Electronic Marquee The university’s electronic marquees are used to announce and promote major university related news and activities. The Office of Public Affairs determines the frequency and length of messages to meet the needs of the campus community. Requests must be made at least two weeks in advance of the desired display dates. Fill out the online Electronic Marquee Request Form to submit your request. For questions, email us at polycentric@csupomona.edu.
