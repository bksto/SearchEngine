Dramatic cuts in state funding for education, few options for part-time employment, the sudden loss of family income, increased competition for key classes and top programs... this is the reality facing California students today. Give Now! This year, unlike any before, your generosity will play a crucial role in enabling many of our best and brightest to bridge a widening gap, to stay in school, to stay on track. At UCR, we are exceptionally proud of the sheer talent, determination and diversity of our students, so many of whom have already worked hard to beat the odds and become the first in their families to attend college. And not just any college. Our nation's premiere public university... the University of California. Please help us support these outstanding young scholars by making a gift in support of scholarships. Working together, we can complete the puzzle and help California students picture their continued success. UCR — The University for California In addition to the need for tuition support, students and their families also need help each year to cover up to $10,000 worth of books, room and board, transportation and personal expenses. Gifts to the UCR Fund also provide critical support to the campus, resulting in more resources and fewer costs for our families. Along with financial aid available to students at all UC campuses, such as the Blue and Gold Opportunity Fund program that covers tuition and fees this academic year for families with incomes of $60,000 or less, UCR is committed to expanding the number of scholarships, fellowships and flexible campus resources available for our undergraduates, graduate students and athletes. Scholarships change lives both for those who receive them and for the donors who make them possible. Your support enables students of every background and ambition, from first-generation college enrollees to dedicated graduate researches, to reach their goal. Give Now! HOW YOU CAN HELP A scholarship can be created by making a one-time gift of cash or securities, by making a pledge – payable over five years or less – or by establishing an endowment. A scholarship can be created with planned gifts such as a bequest in your will, a charitable gift annuity or trust. Contact Jan Opdyke, executive director of scholarships, fellowships and annual giving, to discover which funding options best meet your needs. Learn more about how to make a gift to UC Riverside.
