Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta. UC Santa Cruz is a distinctive community that inspires its students to achieve their goals, both inside and outside the classroom. The campus offers a myriad of opportunities for student engagement and support, including the 10 residential colleges; over 100 student organizations; sports including NCAA competition, sports clubs, and intramurals; and resources such as the Ethnic Resource Centers and Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS), just to name a few. The stunning natural beauty of our campus is a compelling backdrop for your educational journey. Our redwood forests, expansive meadows, and breathtaking views of the Monterey Bay are unmatched, while our location is conveniently near important resources for research and internships, such as Silicon Valley and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Our unique campus and its surrounding community nurture students in their studies and personal lives. Students describe the campus as "chill" -- a tolerant, supportive place where differences among people are celebrated. Whatever your interests, you will find a community here to help support you.
