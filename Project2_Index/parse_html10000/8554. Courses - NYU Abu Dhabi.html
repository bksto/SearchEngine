ACS-AD 101X Anthropology and the Arab World How have anthropologists encountered, written about, and produced the “Arab world” over the past century? Beginning with early Western travelers’ imaginaries of Arabia and ending with an ethnographic memoir, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.  Through ethnography, literature, film and field-trips, we will explore such topics as gender, sociality and identity; military conflict and war; disease, bioethics and Islam; pilgrimage and piety; labor migration, refugees, and diaspora; globalization, media and mediation; and the Arab uprisings.

ACS-AD 131X Emergence of the Modern Middle East At the crossroads between Asia, Africa and Europe, the region that Europeans and North Americans labeled "The Middle East" presents a dynamic and heterogeneous landscape of peninsulas and isthmuses, republics and monarchies, oil producing countries, and labor exporting nations. This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010–2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

ACS-AD 201X Making of the Muslim Middle East Islam changed and shaped the Middle East, the Mediterranean world, and South Asia following its emergence in the seventh century. Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi’a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

ACS-AD 202 Paradise Lost: Muslims, Christians and Jews in al-Andalus From the beginning of the 8th to the beginning of the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

ACS-AD 203X Heritage, History and Memory in the Modern "Middle East" How do those who live in “the Middle East” relate to their past(s), and what discourses do they draw on to represent and authorize it today?  How is “the past” recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage. This course includes a class trip to Turkey.

ACS-AD 204J Interwoven Pasts of Spain and Morocco At the western end of the Mediterranean, the religious, political, and economic histories of North Africa and Iberia have always been intertwined. This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711–1492 when various parts of the Iberian peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war. The course includes an extended trip through Morocco and Spain. January 2013 Justin Stearns - T, BD Taught in Madrid, Spain This course appears in...

ACS-AD 205J Arab Crossroads in China In this course we immerse ourselves in the lives and culture of the Arab merchant communities that settled in China from the early days of Islam until the early modern period. We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the "Arabian Seas." We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history—the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ACS-AD 206X Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages This course examines the history and culture of the Jews in the medieval Islamic world, beginning with the historiographical debate about this contentious subject. The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur’an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

ACS-AD 207JX History of Modern Iran This course will cover major turning points in modern Iran, from the 1906 Constitutional Revolution to the 1979 Islamic Revolution  and since. Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini’s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state’s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ACS-AD 231JX Oil and Energy in the Middle East This course provides an overview of the issues surrounding global energy supplies, oil’s unique economic properties, and its role in shaping the political economy of the Middle East and U.S. strategic interests in the region. We begin by discussing the basic science and availability of energy sources, the state of technology, the functioning of energy markets, the challenges of coping with global climate change and the key role of the oil reserves in the Middle East. The second part of the course focuses on the history of oil in the Middle East and its impact on societies in the region.

ACS-AD 232X Society and Politics of Saudi Arabia This course is an introduction to the study of Saudi Arabia and can be taken as a gateway course to the Arab Crossroads concentration. Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.   Fall 2011; 14 Weeks Pascal Menoret - MR, 9:55-11:10 Taught in Abu Dhabi Fall 2012; 14 Weeks Pascal Menoret - TR, 11:20-12:35 Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

ACS-AD 233 War and Media in the Middle East This course examines two simultaneous processes in the Middle East since the mid-20th century: 1) how war has become mediatized, and 2) how media has been militarized. Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies – including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet – are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, Sex and Modernity This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.   Spring 2015; 14 Weeks Marc Michael - TR, 3:35-4:50 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

ACS-AD 261J Cities and Modern Arabic Literature We use fiction as a tool to visit (figuratively) five cities: Cairo, Alexandria, Beirut, Haifa, and Baghdad. The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

ACS-AD 263J Modern Architecture in Abu Dhabi This course is an exploration of modern architecture in the city. Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ACS-AD 290X Problems and Methods in Arab Crossroads Studies This seminar introduces students to the main theoretical and epistemological trends in the study of the Arab crossroads region, and offers practical examples of the methodologies used by scholars in the humanities and the qualitative social sciences. We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project. Students in the NYUNY MEIS Dept: This course counts for MEIS elective credit.

AHC-AD 114 Translation as Multimedia Practice and Metaphor This course concerns the aesthetics and politics of translation, both as a historically and culturally situated practice and as a rich metaphor for cultural production, cross-cultural encounter, and other types of creation, appropriation, and change. The course emphasizes transformations that occur in cross-media translations, such as when poems are set to music and books are turned into films. In addition to writing a number of short, critical essays on translations broadly conceived, studies create literary and/or cross-media translations of their own. Students perform their translations at the end of the semester. Spring 2014; 14 Weeks Paulo Lemos Horta - TR, 2:35-3:50 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

AHC-AD 115 A World Transformed?: The Global "Sixties" This course explores the artistic and intellectual avant-gardes, counter-cultures, and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s from a global perspective, assessing their impact on individual identities, social and gender hierarchies, domestic politics, and international relations during the Cold War. It traces the history of the various protest movements and the plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large. Course materials draw on the most recent historiography, as well as literature, film, art, music, and oral history.

AHC-AD 126 Age of Warhol At the global art market's most recent peak in 2007, American Pop artist Andy Warhol (1928-1987) edged out Pablo Picasso to become the world's highest earning painter at auction. Although he has recently ceded that position to Chinese artists Zhang Daqian (1899-1983) and Qi Baishi (1864-1957), Warhol remains one of the most influential forces in contemporary art worldwide. From his famous Campbell's soup cans to his enduring aphorism that "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for fifteen minutes," Warhol's art and thinking saturate contemporary culture. This seminar uses his diaries and other writing as a base-line against which we will examine his 25-year career as a painter, filmmaker, publisher and music producer, TV personality, and artistic mentor and collaborator, as well as his legacy in what has been described as our "Warhol economy." What can Warhol's output and reception tell us about class, gender and sexuality, religion, and media over the last half century? And how should we understand his role in the making of global culture today?  Spring 2013; 14 Weeks Bryan Waterman - MW, 2:35-3:50 PM Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

AHC-AD 128J Children and Childhood: Medical, Historical and Cultural Perspectives Every society cares deeply about its children, but every society cares for its children differently. This global examination of children will discuss common themes and cultural variations. We will consider child labor, children in cities, children and war, and the changing historical nature of the family in America, Europe, and China. We discuss education and health in global perspective, looking at children in the urban world of the 21st century, with field trips to the Shanghai Children’s Palace, the Shanghai Children’s Hospital, a school, an orphanage.  Each student will report to the class on some particular theme of childhood in comparative cultural perspective. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

AHC-AD 129J Memory and the City: Berlin in 20th Century History and Literature One may well call European and especially German history in the 20th century eventful. As the German capital, Berlin saw the transition of the German Empire to a functioning if turbulent democratic state in 1918. The rise of the Nazis to power and their defeat in WW II led to the notorious division of the city which then belonged to two states. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, German reunification was imminent. The course will engage with Berlin as a city of memory as represented in places and reflected in literature. Visits include: Checkpoint Charlie; the Berlin Wall; the Reichstag; the Olympic stadium and village; the Bauhaus Archive and Museum; and the Gemäldegalerie.   January 2013 Wolfgang Neuber - T, BD Taught in Berlin, Germany This course appears in...

AHC-AD 130J Miracle of Florence In the 15th and 16th centuries, the city of Florence was a center of immense creativity in every area of human understanding and endeavor. It was the center of that extraordinary moment we call "the Renaissance"—the revolution in art, architecture, politics, philosophy and science that has shaped our view of the world, and the place of human beings in it. In this seminar, we read representative writings from several of the great Florentine thinkers of the period—Alberti, Machiavelli, Pico, and Galileo. Our goal is twofold: to discover what was original in each, and to grasp how all were connected by a shared set of ideals and beliefs. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to the main cultural monuments of Florence, where we see (among other wonders) the palaces and churches that Alberti designed, the telescope through which Galileo spied the moons of Jupiter, and the tomb where Machiavelli lies.

AHC-AD 131J The Enlightenment and Its Institutions With astonishing speed—mere decades in the middle of the eighteenth century—Enlightenment not only transformed how we think about ourselves, through new concepts of individuality and community, liberty and verifiable truth, it also remade Britain’s cities and institutions. Imagine London without the British Museum (1759) or the Royal Academy (1768). Imagine our curriculum without Johnson’s Dictionary (1755) or the Encyclopedia Britannica (1768). 250 years later, we will use the resources of the Global Network University to recover how this revolution in methods, tools, and institutions recast inquiry and enterprise in the West and to consider what we might do with our Enlightenment inheritance now. Behind-the-scenes adventures into London’s museums, galleries, and civic societies allow us to add our own tracks to the intellectual map we draw in class.

AHC-AD 132J Prague, Capital of Europe Prague should have been destroyed during the Second World War, like other major cities in Europe, but somehow it wasn't. The remarkable survival of this exquisite city allows us to explore Central European history and culture in the context of a completely preserved inner urban core dating back to the Middle Ages. Drawing upon primary source readings, cartography, musical performances, art and architecture, the course illuminates the way crosscurrents of European culture became focused in Prague between 1400 and the present. In addition to academic encounters with such figures as Mucha, Kafka, Mozart, and Kundera, the course includes walking tours around Prague, trips to museums and concerts, excursions outside the city, and interactions with leading local performers and thinkers.

AHC-AD 133J Idea of the Renaissance in Modern Thought Ever since the late seventeenth century, thinkers calling themselves "modern" have sought to establish a sense of their relationship to ancient history and thought. Florence has played a major role in these efforts and in the very idea of what modernity is. First, because Florence has remained intimately associated with the Renaissance, and thus with a literary, aesthetic, and scientific return to the Ancients. And second, because it is seen as a birthplace of modern political thought—especially republicanism and the theory of the state. In this class we will study the place of Florence in the modern imagination. We follow in the footsteps, both textual and actual, of thinkers who looked back to the past, and even at themselves, through the Florentine lens, and who asked what it means to be modern, to look to “the ancients,” and to look at the Renaissance as a cultural rebirth, by way of the city and its cultural heroes.

AHC-AD 134 Women's Voices As cultural traditions have for the most part carried the voices of men, this course will consider the question: what can we learn from listening to women?  We will listen to a range of women’s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (“A World Apart”) and Haifaa al-Mansour (“Wadjda”); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (The Fragility of Goodness) and Leila Ahmed (Border Passage). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.

AHC-AD 135 Reading the Earth: World Literature and the Environment This course introduces students to several genres of literature—drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story—and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism.  We will be examining conceptions of nature and how “the natural” is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion.  Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings.  In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective.  In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally.  Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.

AHC-AD 136J Art, Culture and Self An interdisciplinary look at different ways of construing the self and how they both affect and are affected by culture, with a focus on China and the arts.  Topics will include the contrast afforded by the West; originality and the Chinese copycat phenomenon; the autobiographical impulse; and hybridity.  Exercises in cultural psychology and readings and lectures on art, architecture and literature will be supplemented by field trips to a variety of museums, such as the Shanghai Museum, the Shikumen Museum, the Rockbund Art Museum, the Chinese Imperial Examination System Museum, and the Propaganda Poster Art Museum, as well as to the Novartis research lab, where cross-cultural issues affecting scientific research are being addressed through architecture. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

AHC-AD 137J Imagining the Renaissance City: Florence and Siena Many institutions central to today’s cities – banks, hospitals, civic governments, museums, communal systems of welfare and sustainability – had their testing grounds in the small Tuscan towns of medieval and Renaissance Italy.  These towns also pioneered recognizably modern artistic, cultural, and engineering practices. Florence and Siena were especially vibrant in this transformation of urban life: the one a powerhouse of culture and industry, the other the Wall Street of Europe as it financed entrepreneurs, popes, and Europe’s kings.  Our project for our three weeks together is to figure out what made Florence and Siena tick. We’ll come to know these cities intimately, visiting seats of government and Renaissance orphanages, climbing towers, exploring the home of a fifteenth-century merchant, and prowling a recently-excavated crypt under Siena’s cathedral. We’ll also read and study the utopian (and dystopian) visions of these cities – Lorenzetti’s frescoes of Good Government and Dante’s Inferno -- along with diaries, letters, and constitutions. And to help you hone your writing skills, we’ll read the travelogues of two of Italy’s greatest story-tellers: Marco Polo and Italo Calvino. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ANTH-AD 102J Anthropology of Indigenous Australia: Art, Politics and Cultural Futures This course offers an introduction to some of the current issues in the anthropology of Indigenous Australia, considering a range of Aboriginal forms of social being, ranging historically and geographically and giving significant focus to the changing relationships between Indigenous people and the settler nation of Australia.  We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination – in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism – in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms.  While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would “die out” and later that they would or could be simply “assimilated,” we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called “the great Australian silence” and asserting their right to a cultural future.  This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do combinations of certain features in offspring translate into specific characteristics that either enhance or diminish the organism’s fitness? Answers to questions such as these fall partly within the discipline of genetics, which is the study of heredity. Principles from the Foundations of Science curriculum provide a framework for learning about classical genetics, chromosome structure and mutation, gene function and regulation, and aspects of molecular and developmental genetics. Recent studies in human genetics and their applications, particularly to health-related issues, are also investigated.

What’s the microbiome, and why should you care? How do we know about human migration patterns in ancient times, or the domestication of plants? What can our DNA tell us about heritable diseases? Fueled largely by the Human Genome Project, modern biological science has entered a new, revolutionary era in the 21st century. Genomics and Bioinformatics – the collection and analysis of vast amounts of sequence and functional data – are transforming the way we think, enabling us to solve long-standing mysteries and ask new kinds of questions. New scientific discoveries from genome sciences are impacting society, and our every day lives, on all levels: public policy, medicine, health, and the environment.  Familiarity with these fields is thus vital for any educated citizen in our globally interconnected world.  This course introduces students to fundamental concepts and hot topics in genome science through seminars, critical review of current research articles, student presentations, and interactive discussion. In Spring 2015, Genome Biology will be held as a joint course between New York and Abu Dhabi, enabling students to get to know their peers across the Global Network University. *Note : (Spring 2015) will be co-taught with an instructor from New York (Manpreet, Katari).  This course has a laboratory component.

The guiding principal in designing synthetic projects is most often derived from systems level understanding of cellular networks, with metabolic network analyses playing a key role in offering informed hypotheses in how to modify cellular wirings for a desired outcome. This course combines lectures, class discussions, and lab experiments (both wet and computational) to explore applications of advanced genomics and molecular biology tools to alter metabolic circuitries of E. coli as a model.  The course engages students in a guided research project to learn advanced molecular techniques (such as gene silencing through CRISPR/Cas or TALEN systems), and systems level analysis of metabolism through pathway and flux balance analysis using integrated computational tools such as PathwayTools.  Students will become familiar with engineering concepts such as defining biological components as “parts” and cataloging them in synthetic biology parts registries. Students will also design novel genetic circuits, assemble new constructs and transform competent cells with in house cloned vectors. In addition, students will develop skills to formulate systems based hypotheses and write scientific research proposals.  Spring 2015; 14 Weeks Kourosh Salehi-Ashtiani, Joseph Koussa - W, 12:15-4:45 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

BIOL-AD 52J Brains in Action Every animal on the planet is a master of its universe. Bats fly with great precision in total darkness. Honeybees find their way home using a path they have never seen before. Baby songbirds retain the memory of hearing their father’s song for several months before they actually are able to sing that song themselves. All these animals rely on specific mechanisms in their brains to endow them with these remarkable abilities. Understanding these mechanisms can provide deep insights into how all brains, including our own, are shaped by evolution to be fantastic problem solving machines. In this course we will explore the unique worlds of several animals, highlighting first the specific environmental problems that a particular animal must solve, and second, the amazing ways the brains of these animals implement imaginative solutions to these problems. This course does not presume a strong background in biology, but two things help: an appreciation of the beauty of the animals around us and a genuine curiosity about how in the world they are able to do what they do.

We begin by discussing that voices relationship to the body (both in terms of anatomy and contemporary discourse on open "embodiment") and to a number of technologies from amplification to auto-tune. In the second half of the course, we focus in on the salience of voice within the experimental music scene in New York. Perhaps most importantly, we treat our classes in experimental vocal collective, composing and performing together throughout the term. No prior musical experience is necessary, but a willingness to make vocal sounds in public is required. We examine a number of ways in which the voice has been framed as the result of a complex physiological process; as a quasi-mystical aesthetic object; as a vehicle for communication; as a gendered, racialized, and essentialized text; as a technologically mediated commodity; and as a master trope for identity, human agency, immediacy, and truth. Students read a number of seminal texts on voice; write several focused essays; complete a multimedia project; and, more importantly, use their own voices to make a chorus of sounds in class.   Students in the NYUNY Music Dept: This course counts for Music elective credit * Please note the duration of this course during summer 2013 is 28 May-14 June *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREA-AD 03 Instruments of World Cultures Musical instruments have been created by humans for at least 35,000 years. How do diverse musical cultures view the significance of the sounds and playing techniques of musical instruments? From instrumental story-telling in Siberia, Central Asian shaman-bards, dervish flutes, folk, Gypsy and classical fiddling, dulcimers, psalteries and keyboards to drumming in several parts of the world, the course examines why musical cultures need instruments; how these instruments interact with or take the place of vocal music; where they are connected to dance and where they have evolved far from dance; how diverse cultures attribute positive or negative moral values to different instruments and their players; and how a single musical culture may feel the need to exchange, develop or exclude particular musical instruments over time.  For the NYUNY Music Dept: This course counts for Music ethnomusicology elective credit   Fall 2011; 14 Weeks Walter Zev Feldman - MR, 11:20-12:35 Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREA-AD 04J Gardens of Eden The Garden of Eden haunts the history of the peoples of the Book—Jews, Christians, Muslims—as primal site of creation, bounty, betrayal, and loss, as spur to repentance and redemption, as preview of heaven and model of earthly Utopia. The exile of Adam and Eve from the garden that God planted for the first man and filled with all the Earth's creatures and plants set their descendants on an infinite quest to find, describe, and recreate it. The course studies the efforts by people of the Abrahamic religions to specify the site, form, and meaning of the first Garden, in theology, literature, visual art, film, and garden design. It seeks convergences and differences among these interpretations across millennia and media, and ask whether the Garden of Eden continues to hold productive meanings today.

COREA-AD 09W Reinventions of Love This course explores how the mythology, poetics, imagery, and emotion associated with romantic love have varied dramatically over time and in different cultures. Spanning several millennia and many continents, our  material challenges us to think about gender, family, biology, and faith as manifestations of an attempt to reconcile human needs and desires. We work with ancient texts like the Ramayana, the Upanishads, and the Song of Songs; the poetry of Kalidasa, Rumi, and Neruda; plays by Zeami, Euripides, Shakespeare, Lorca, Tennessee Williams, and Sarah Kane; the music of PJ Harvey, Antony & The Johnsons, and Thom Yorke; the photography of Cindy Sherman; and the films of David Lynch.

COREA-AD 10 Scapegoat The scapegoat, however unwillingly, has played a role in human culture since the earliest times. This course examines the phenomena of scapegoating from both a historical and psychological perspective, and examines its treatment in films, literature, music, and new technology. Tracing the origins of scapegoating as a tribal rite and as one of the defining aspects of Greek tragedy, this course ultimately poses the question—what is it, in the human psyche, that causes us to demonize and dehumanize the “other,” and demand, in the most extreme cases, witch trials throughout the centuries, mob lynchings, the Holocaust, and the more recent genocide in Rwanda. This course also touches on the technological forms of scapegoating such as cyber-bullying and examines how the Internet itself is often used as a scapegoating device.

COREA-AD 19 Communication and Technology The course will consider the development of and reaction to some of the most transformative of humankind's inventions -- its forms of communication. Through an analysis of the history of image making, writing, printing, photography, the telegraph, radio and television, the course will consider the process through which the uses of such new media are recognized, how they are celebrated and criticized, and what they have made it possible to say and think. In the background, as these histories are analyzed, will be similar questions about the swarm of recent communications technologies loosely known as the Internet. At the end of the course that discussion will move to the foreground.

COREA-AD 20 Renaissance Orientations Scholarly approaches to Renaissance art have traditionally focused on what it inherited from the Roman world. What happens to our understanding of the Renaissance when we highlight its relationship to Jerusalem, Constantinople, and other cultural centers in the Eastern Mediterranean? This course investigates the interpretive implications of this shift in orientation, exploring the West’s fascination with objects and images produced by Byzantine and Islamic artists, and the complications of identity produced by pilgrimages to the east, both real and imaginary.

COREA-AD 22 Inventions Inventions have played a pivotal role in the development of history, mankind, and culture. Inventors articulate problems and find creative solutions, often by combining concepts that are not typically linked. This class examines inventions and the process of inventing through case studies. We consider the historical context of inventions and how the use of inventions can change from one culture to another. Some of the inventions we explore are the bow and arrow, the lever, the bicycle, dynamite, the fax machine, and the computer. Students are presented with problems and asked to create prototypes and invent new tools.

COREA-AD 23 Rhythm Rhythm has been described as patterns of events in time and space, and is a prominent feature of life and learning. This interdisciplinary course examines what rhythm is and how it manifests itself in a wide variety of domains that range from music and the visual decorative arts traditions spanning cultures across the globe and throughout history, to how it emerges in, and is informed by, areas such as mathematics, computer science, music theory, music technology, biology, psychology, linguistics, sociology, evolution and human migrations, ethnology, crystallography, nuclear physics, calendar design, radio astronomy, architecture, computer graphics, and the visual arts. Students read from books and journal articles, solve problems, listen to music, drum with their hands on their desks, learn how to use computer software systems to analyze as well as generate rhythms, solve puzzles of musical time patterns, and write on a variety of topics. They complete an individual research project that showcases the application of knowledge in their selected discipline and culture to an open question concerned with rhythm. They discuss progress on their projects during the term, and present their results to the class at the end of term. No computer programming experience or musical training is required.

COREA-AD 27 Creativity and Innovation This course will probe the heuristics of human innovation as understood by ancient and modern inventors and philosophers. The central question of this course are the following, What are the sources, requirements, and factors that influence human ingenuity? Is creativity a gift or a skill? How does creativity differ from innovation? To address these questions, we consider the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; technological innovations that affected the course of human history; and inventions that shape our modern world. Throughout the course, a strong emphasis will be placed on developing a personal philosophy and methodology for creativity.

COREA-AD 28 Fame Historian Leo Braudy notes that: “the history of fame is also the history of the shifting definition of achievement in the social world.” We will track early discourses of heroism and immortality from Alexander the Great to today’s reality celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Beginning with concepts of fame in antiquity, we investigate Virgil’s The Aeneid, The Bible, Homer's The Odyssey, and Shakespeare’s King Richard III. The rise of contemporary stars across film, television, and theatre raises questions about the ways in which celebrities help manage historically conditioned categories of classification, such as gender, sexuality, race, class and nationality. Case studies of non-Western celebrities, highlight the formatting of modern stardom in Asia (Jackie Chan and Jet Li), Africa (Fela Kuti), and the Middle East (Umm Kulthum).  Spring 2013; 14 Weeks Jason King - MW, 1:10-2:25 PM Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 2014; 14 Weeks Jason King - MW, 2:35-3:50 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREA-AD 29 Performing Body in History This class examines the representation and theorization of the human body as evident in acting theory and performance practices. We will be particularly attentive to the international circulation of ideas of the body. To what extent are the commentaries of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) on Galen and Plato important to Renaissance Europe’s understanding of the performing body? How has Tadashi Suzuki’s interest in Noh, Kabuki, and Ancient Greek theatre informed his collaborations with major figures of the European theatre? Authors will include: Ibn Rushd, Plato, Zeami, Shakespeare, Diderot, Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Brecht, Suzuki.

COREA-AD 30W Representations This course will consider representations of social and historical realities within which notions of cultural identity, citizenship and power are imagined and presented. Using examples from the performing arts, film and photography, we explore formal technologies of creating representations and cultural modes of interpreting them, and compare how reality is abstracted and codified by representations from different parts of the world. Some of the examples are films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Mother India, Xala and Al Za’eem; plays such as The Road, Al-Malik huwa I-Malik, and St Joan; photographs by Annie Liebovitz, Brian Duffy and Yousef Karsh. Basic semiotic, materialist and reception theories will offer prisms for our study. Key essays such as Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for the Pastness of India by Dipesh Charkravorty, Fictions of the Pose by Harry Berger, Imperialist Nostalgia by Renato Rosaldo, and Theorizing the Male Gaze by Edward Snow are read side by side videos of performances, films and slides of photographs.

COREA-AD 31W Machine Dreams Machines have provided the means for artists to dream different worlds into existence.  Machines impact how we structure our thoughts, our language, and even our bodies. We will examine how writers, visual artists, filmmakers and performers have creatively engaged both obsolete and emerging technologies—mirrors, camera obscuras, phonographs, photocopiers, projectors, telephones, computers, and satellites — to communicate shifts in how we perceive time, movement, space, similarity and difference among human beings, and operations of political power.  We will study a variety of philosophers, scientists, anthropologists, cultural theorists, visual artists and playwrights including Horace, Euripides, Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Michael Taussig, David Hockey, Ingres, Vermeer, Caravaggio, Chuck Close, films by the Lumiere Brothers and Jean Rouch, Apple Computer television commercials, and web-based performance/installation art by Stelarc, Electronic Disturbance Theatre, Emily Jacir, and Ai Weiwei.

COREA-AD 32 Identity: Text, Image, and Place The course explores how image-based representations, written texts, and aspects of the built environment reflect certain conceptions of identity. The course considers paintings, photographs, video, ego documents, and journals. We will focus on artistic practices that examine and/or demonstrate personal or preconceived notions of identity through acts of self-representation. Our questions include: Why do artists from a particular region privilege certain issues over others? What extenuating circumstances may influence an artist's practice? How do artists consider Identity through examination of place? What role does gender or gendered stereotypes play in the production of art? How do artists represent themselves in order to challenge gender or cultural stereotypes?  We explore several media and methods of self-representation in artistic practice. Basic visual criticism techniques and theory is introduced in order to understand and differentiate between a wide range of artistic practices and intentions. The course considers artists from the USA, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and includes visits to local galleries and artist studios.

COREA-AD 33 Perception in Music and Sound What is perception and how is it mediated by culture and technology? To what extent do objects of perception look and sound the same across individuals, cultures, and means of representation? How much of music is a function of the way our auditory system works and how much is learned as a part of culture? This class approaches these questions by looking at the scientific literature (to understand the basics of perception), by examining cultural objects such as musical instruments, scales, and performances (for specific examples that bring the ideas into focus) and by contrasting the various technologies for storing and reproducing sound. * Please note the duration of this course during summer 2013 is 26 May-20 June   Prerequisites: None.

This course analyzes what we understand as “music.” Drawing on music of different styles from all over the world, we will explore what constitutes musical meaning, how it is produced, and how music expresses feelings. Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music. A lab portion of the class guides students through basic musical elements such as notation systems, scales, and simple compositional techniques.

COREA-AD 35 Lies and Lying Lying is an integral part of human communication. It is only in contrast to lies that we are able to construct the concept of truth and “choose” our perception of reality. From white lies and exaggerations to advanced techniques of persuasion such as propaganda and brainwashing, this course will examine the psychological, philosophical, ethical and social aspects of several contexts in which lying commonly occurs: Art, Culture, Literature, Science, Politics, Advertising, Journalism, Relationships, Digital World and History. We will discuss and analyze the motives, techniques, technology and outcomes of some of the biggest lies and liars throughout history, from mythological  gods in ancient Greece through fake alchemists in the Islamic Golden Age to contemporary schemers. We will study examples of lying in texts, films, biographies, cartography, visual arts, internet, social networking, mass media, advertisement as well as guest liars and lying experts.

COREA-AD 36W Death: Myths, Histories, Metamorphoses Death is a universal fact of human life, powerfully defining the exigencies of our experience. From ancient times until the present, artistic works have registered changing attitudes towards death in the stories they tell. In this seminar, we will examine artistic responses to mortality across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts—including in the myths of Orpheus and Osiris, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the text of the Ramayana; the poetry of Darwish, Neruda, and Rilke; stories by Tolstoy, Mishima, and Benjamin; and music of Dowland, Wagner, and Adams. Selected films and plays, including the Noh Drama of Japan, also are considered. Students develop a collaborative or individual artistic project and related critical paper demonstrating their engagement with the topic. This course is writing intensive.

COREA-AD 37W Staging the Self This course will examine the representation of personal experience in its biographical and autobiographical forms in the arts with a focus on performance. We pay particular attention to the ways in which personhood is aesthetically, psychologically, and politically theorized in different contexts. What does an individual’s experience represent in specific art works? How is the relationship of individual experience to collective experience reconstructed in different arts works? Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist’s oeuvre in relation to their personal life? In what ways do individual art works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities? Texts for the course include works by Irving Goffman, Errol Morris, Erik Erikson, Joseph Roach, Freddie Rokem, Deirdre Heddon, and selected plays, films and museum displays.

Internally, a person’s individual memory content is overwritten each and every time something is remembered. Externally, memory is determined by social practices and, not least, our physical environment, shaping what may be called social or collective memory. The stability of the physical environment is a guarantor of an individual’s memory and, by implication, identity, to a much greater extent than individual memory itself; it was as early as 2000 years ago that the nexus of the urban space and a stable memory was established (Cicero, Quintilian). The class will focus on theoretical concepts of memory in the fields of the arts, technology and invention in antiquity and the 20th century (Warburg, Halbwachs, Nora), discuss a novel that satirically memorises the fall of the Wall (Brussig) and provide numerous field trips that exemplify the concepts of social/collective memory based upon the urban space of Berlin (the replacement of the GDR Palace of the Republic by a reconstructed City Palace, Holocaust Memorial, Sinti and Roma Memorial, Jewish Museum, book burning memorial, Berlin Wall, Berlin Museums, the 3rd Reich Germania project). *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREA-AD 39 Tools We are habituated to think of tools as physical objects that facilitate utilitarian actions. Pencils, glassware, and hammers are tools of this type. However, the definition of a tool can be expanded beyond material objects, to include things like storytelling and the internet. Tools can facilitate interpersonal interactions and enable intimate communication, yet have no physical manifestation. This course studies the invention and use of tools across cultures and time. We examine a large number of examples, starting with languages, moving through tools like the wheel and metalwork to modern tools like software and network topologies, asking how our choice of tools changes the way we think about our goals.

And how has that drive shaped not only the history of human communication but of record-keeping itself? What is the relationship between an event and the records or recordings we make of it? Is there tension between the promise of mimetic or documentary fidelity and new possibilities for art and imagination? When is the memorializing goal better served by invention than recording? This course will examine a series of technological innovations in record-keeping and record-making, from cuneiform to cassette culture, mp3s, and beyond. Readings will address histories and theories of orality and literacy, archives, print, photography, film, sound recording, and other media as we explore fundamental questions about memory, history, technology, and the relationship between art and life.

COREA-AD 41 Nomads What can the unique human ecology and worldview that emerges from mobile ways of life teach us about human ingenuity and culture? This course uses the lenses of philosophy, art, and design to examine the history, influence, and cultural underpinnings of nomadism and nomadic dwelling. Paying special attention to kinetic objects and the built environment, we will probe historical and contemporary conceptions of ownership and ecology, transience and permanence, home and homelessness, and citizenship and belonging. We will study writings by Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, and Rosi Braidotti, artworks by Andrea Zittel, Lucy Orta, and Krzysztof Wodiczko and cinematic works including Lawrence of Arabia and Dances with Wolves. All aspects of mobile dwellings, from familiar vernacular models such as tents and huts to developments in humanitarian design and contemporary art, will be considered. Students will be presented with a series of design challenges and will be asked to solve problems by creating new designs and producing prototypes. No previous background or training in design is required.     Fall 2014; 14 Weeks David Darts - TR, 3:35-4:50 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREA-AD 42 Art and Emotion While Aristotle celebrated the capacity of art to elicit emotion, Plato treated it with suspicion. Suspected of irrationality, emotion has continued to hold a contested position in the understanding of art. This course will explore the ways that art both expresses and arouses the emotions and to what value and ends. It asks how stories engage us in prototypical, emotional human situations such as suffering, separation, loss, recognition and reunion. We will think about what aspects of our emotional responses are universal, what are culturally specific, what are gendered, what are individual and personal, and the similarities and differences between art emotions and actual emotions. We will draw on a wide range of artworks from a variety of periods and cultures as case studies, including visual and narrative representations of the Passion of Christ; canonical love stories, like Laila Majnun and Romeo and Juliet; classical and modern tragedy; romantic, popular, and program music; and comic art like The Comedy of Errors and silent film comedy. These studies will be framed by the theories of, among others, Aristotle, Abhinavagupta, Tolstoy, Langer, Bergson, Freud, analytic philosophy (Carroll, Kivy), and cognitive theory (Hogan).

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present.  The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the  laments  and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict.  Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso,  Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among  others.   Fall 2014; 14 Weeks Gwyneth Bravo - TR, 10:40-11:55 am Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREA-AD 44 Time This course explores the multifaceted nature of time, in different historical, social and religious contexts.  We will pursue three main strands: 1) changing conceptions of time, time-keeping systems, and states of time consciousness from antiquity to the present; 2) representations of time in works of art that heighten our apprehension of time and its vertiginous quality or aim to escape the rule of time and induce a quality of timeless suspension; and 3) the technologies of time-keeping from sundials to atomic watches, calendars to timelines.  Denaturalizing our own conventions of keeping time, we will consider the purposes of time measurement, the history of the hour, the development of the mechanical clock and its impact on society, the relationship between clock time and industrialization, the shift from local to international standard time, and the question whether the human experience of time is common across cultures or is culturally specific and variable.

COREA-AD 45J Sound(ings) This course will explore the meaning of sound in the urban and natural environments within Abu Dhabi and the UAE. An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques.  The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREA-AD 47 Listening This course explores ways of listening, and of being a listener, in human experience, with attention to the role of the ear in the constitution of subjects, communities, and societies of different times and places. Topics include debates about the listening subject in Western philosophy and media studies; the role of the ‘ethnographic ear’ in cultural anthropology and ethnomusicology; theories and methods of ‘soundscape research’ and ‘acoustemology’; and aurality as an aspect of culture, explored through case studies ranging from the development of sound reproduction technologies, to deaf culture, to the ethics of sounding and listening in religious practice. Course readings, drawn from a wide range of disciplines, include foundational texts in the emerging interdisciplinary field of ‘sound studies’. In addition to engaging critically with a range of ideas and debates through discussion, presentations, and writing, students will try their ears at specialized modes of training and data collection developed by sound-oriented researchers and artists.

COREA-AD 48 Vision This seminar concerns the phenomenon of vision. The sense of vision is closely related to processes of understanding, thought, and linguistic interpretation. Seeing is an activity in which the eye and brain work together, but the imagination also affects vision, for we sometimes imagine what we say we see. We will study the connection of image and language using the example of Hollis Frampton’s film Nostalgia, which suggests that vision entails an aspect of imagining. We will approach questions about the nature of vision on the basis of texts, cinematic materials, art works, and experiments we conduct. The texts on which we will work include “classical” ones by authors such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, but also more recent theoretical approaches by Serge Daney, for example. We will also focus on the phenomenon of synaesthesia as it is emphasized as ‘haptic seeing’ in the work of Lygia Clark.

How do we select, order, preserve and display information and objects? And, what intellectual processes are involved in these activities? What does the content of these collections say about those who created them? And, what kind of narratives can be traced within the display of these collections? This course surveys the phenomenon of collecting, focusing on key moments in its history, from antiquity up to contemporary times.  In the first section of the class, we explore collections of  “thought,” that is, how knowledge has been stored, organized and retrieved – and some of the tools we have developed to do so – including mnemonic devices, writing, codices, libraries, information architecture and digital technologies. The second section concerns physical objects, and their collection, classification, organization, and display. Finally, we discuss the work of modern and contemporary artists who incorporate concepts of assemblage and curation. In response to the readings and to the materials covered in class, students will conceive, create, describe and display a collection of their own making.  Fall 2014; 14 Weeks Denise-Marie Teece - MW, 2:10-3:25 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREA-AD 50W Identity and Object This course asks how objects from the past obtain meaning long after they were made, and how they have come to express the identity of communities, nations, and religions. We will consider fundamental questions of identity by assessing how objects become imbued with meaning.  Who ascribes these objects meaning and why?  How do we relate to objects designated to represent us?  We will explore object biographies from a range of periods, regions and traditions.  We will discuss objects representing contested national and global identities, such as the Cyrus Cylinder from Iraq, and the Koh-i-noor diamond from India, as well as material that facilitates discussion of socially and culturally defined identities.  In all of these examples politics plays a constant role.  Through case studies of iconic objects from around the world, we will compare significance in the originating society with place and function today to better understand how, why, and by whom identity is constructed.

COREI-AD 10 Quantum Theory and Relativity: The Impact of a Scientific Revolution At the beginning of the 20th century, a scientific revolution started that was destined to change radically the way we think about the physical world. Einstein’s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public’s everyday experiences and intuition. Challenging that notion of inaccessibility, this course analyzes some of the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory.

COREI-AD 11J State and Fate of the Earth What is the current state of Earth in terms of human well-being and human impact on Earth’s natural systems? Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world's lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.  Satisfies Science, Society, and History *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 12 Language of Computers: Introduction to Programming Using Python This course provides a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of programming, which is the foundation of Computer Science. It is intended as a first course for students from different disciplines; no prerequisite is needed. Programming has revolutionized every aspect of our lives from art and other media to education, business, and the core sciences. Students learn the basics of how computers “think” and how computer programs (software applications) are created. We develop simple and fun applications involving graphics, sound, text processing, animation, basic interactive game techniques, networking, and web interfaces. Students produce short programs and one final project using Python, a  relatively easy programming language with powerful visual and graphics capabilities.

COREI-AD 13 Mutations and Disease The very word “mutations” tends to raise fear and apprehension since it is so often associated with physical deformities or exposure to harmful agents, including radiation. Perhaps such fear is warranted since many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cancer, are caused by “mutations”, which are mere changes in the genetic information in DNA. Starting with basic concepts, this course explores important cellular macromolecules, such as DNA, and proteins as well as their three-dimensional structures that endow them with their specific functions. In fact, understanding how mutations induce alterations to  macromolecular structures often sheds light on the characteristic symptoms and prognoses of some human diseases and syndromes. Laboratory projects, which focus on introduction to computer modeling, emphasize visualizing in a three-dimensional environment the normal and altered macromolecules associated with some common but complex human maladies.

COREI-AD 15 Microbes Microbes are tiny organisms that are found on every imaginable surface and habitat. This complex myriad can consist of microbes that are essential to a healthy life, as well as microbes that cause infectious diseases in plants and animals, which may also contribute to many chronic diseases and conditions, such as cancer and environmentally-related diseases. To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.

COREI-AD 15J Microbes Microbes are tiny organisms that are found on every imaginable surface and habitat. This complex myriad can consist of microbes that are essential to a healthy life, as well as microbes that cause infectious diseases in plants and animals, which may also contribute to many chronic diseases and conditions, such as cancer and environmentally-related diseases. To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.   This course has a laboratory component.

COREI-AD 16 Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments Over half of the human population lives within 100km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the worlds largest cities. As a result, the world's natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to explain the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globaly and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.  Satisfies Experimental Discovery in the Natural World.

COREI-AD 17 Domain of Crystals Knowing the three-dimensional structure of a molecule is important for understanding its functional properties. Is it indeed possible to visually analyze a molecule and use the observed experimental data to build a three-dimensional model? This structural information can be obtained using a variety of analytical techniques such as X-ray crystallography, and can lead to significant breakthroughs in pharmaceutics. Students grow crystals of different colors, shapes, and sizes and harvest them for physical and morphological  characterization in order to understand the basic principles of atomic structure and theory, chemical bonding and reactions, thermochemistry, periodicity, and solution chemistry.

COREI-AD 19 The Power of Genes Will genetic manipulation ever improve our well-being? When the gene was discovered and our ability to manipulate it became apparent, a whole new era in science began. Scientists wanted to understand the power that hides in the gene and the effects of its manipulation. The Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003 led to the identification of the genes in the Human DNA. This discovery is now leading the way to trying to understand the roles of those genes in our bodies, the diseases that may result from their malfunctioning, and consequently treating those diseases at the gene level. This growing field is known as Gene Therapy. In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy. This course travels through the world of genetics and examines the Human Genome Project, successful stories and challenges in the field of Gene Therapy, Genetically Modified Foods, and Cloning; all being topics that have fundamental implications on the society that will live in and contribute towards.   Spring 2012; 14 Weeks Rana Al-Assah - MR, 9:55-11:10 Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 2013; 14 Weeks Rana Al-Assah - UW, 11:20-12:35 PM Taught in Abu Dhabi Fall 2013; 14 Weeks Rana Al-Assah - U, 10:10-12:50 Taught in Abu Dhabi Fall 2014; 14 Weeks Rana Al-Assah - UW, 9:15-10:30 am Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREI-AD 21 Serendipity in Science In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale “The Three Princes of Serendip,” whose heroes “were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.” In the ensuing centuries, the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improve our standard of living.

COREI-AD 22 Trust, Risk, and Deception in Cyberspace Cyberspace is playing an increasing role in our lives, and our society is rapidly becoming structured around the 24/7 availability and trustworthiness of information systems. We already entrust cyberspace with our privacy, national security, physical safety, and digital identities.  Maintaining an orderly, peaceful, safe, and productive society will increasingly depend on maintaining trust in information systems. However, trust cannot be realized by technology alone. This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is essentially a social system that relies on important technical components.  The course will begin with a discussion of trust, risk and deception as developed in the social sciences and examine how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. In the second part of the course we will examine the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms that have been developed to create trustworthy systems.  In the third and final part of the course we will examine the interplay between the technical and social aspects and see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar and cyberterrorism. A computer science or engineering knowledge is not necessary for taking this course.   Satisfies Science, Society, and History Spring 2012; 14 Weeks Nasir Memon - MTR, 2:35-3:50 Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 2 2014; 7 Weeks Nasir Memon - MW, 1:00-3:40 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 2 2015; 7 Weeks Mustaque Ahamad - MW, 2:10 - 4:50 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREI-AD 23 Copernican Revolution Before Copernicus, the earth was regarded as the stable center of the universe. Coming to accept the earth’s rotation and motion around the sun was one of science’s greatest shocks to humanity’s understanding of our place in the order of things. We investigate the structure of the theories that preceded Copernicus, and the various sorts of arguments—empirical, conceptual, and even religious—that were made for and against his account. Our aim is to appreciate how scientific theories of the world are constructed, criticized and defended. Texts include relevant parts of Aristotle and Ptolemy, Galileo’s Starry Messenger and On The Two Chief Worlds Systems, Thomas Kuhn ‘s The Copernican Revolution, Bertold Brecht’s Galileo, and Paul Feyerabend’s Against Method.

COREI-AD 24J Heuristics Many problems in science, business, and politics require heuristics -- problem solving techniques that often work well even if not perfectly. This course teaches heuristics as they have applied in the design of scientific experiments, the solution of problems global power politics, and in the resolution of economic negotiations. While being exposed to heuristic techniques, students work in small teams that compete with one another to design strategies to solve new puzzles better than other teams. You are given computational tools as needed, but the course has no programming prerequisite. To take this course, you should love to think both qualitatively and quantitatively.  Among the specific problems we will tackle include the design of currencies, leasing strategies for oil exploration, optimal matchmaking, and efficient experimental design. The intent is to make you better able to face complex problems in any field you choose.

COREI-AD 27 Evolution: The Incredible Human Journey What we consider modern human society represents a tiny and very peculiar blip in the very long history of human beings on this planet. Whether we consider the 10,000 year history of settled civilization, the 200,000 year history of anatomically modern humans, or the 6 million year history of “proto-humans” since our divergence from our closest species relatives, to fully understand human society is to consider the incredible journey that has led our species to where we are now. Through an investigation of art, archaeology, psychology, anthropology, and deep history, and with the use of films, myths and scientific research, we explore this epic journey and the legacy that it has left on humanity.    Satisfies Science, Society, and History Fall 2012; 14 Weeks Azim Shariff - TR, 2:35-3:50 Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREI-AD 29J Causality When is it legitimate to conclude that A causes B? In human history, causality was sometimes the province of the gods as in there is lightening because a god is throwing bolts at the earth. The introduction of Aristotelian logic permitted the development of deductive logic and the notion of consistency. Because deduction manipulates knowledge but does not add to it, natural science uses induction in which universal causal laws are believed because of experiments at a few times and places. This course begins with a discussion of the history of the arguments for causality, then it embarks on a detailed discussion of certain great experiments and the conclusions that resulted. In the process, we discuss how the progress of science determines what is accepted as a cause, from the "taint" of an ancestral line to the psychological impacts of childhood. Next, we discuss the inference of causality by machine. Students will work on projects involving the construction of experiments (either ones we have discussed or others), the discovery of the laws of a simulated world that the instructor has created, and then playing a game in that world.

COREI-AD 30 The Mind This course explores the perennial question, how does the mind work? We learn how philosophers, computer scientists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and linguists have answered this question. We consider several stimulating but demanding questions about the nature of the mind and try to understand how the mind enables such things as perception, thinking, and behavior. We review the historical and scientific developments the lead to the contemporary consensus that the human mind is fundamentally a computational organ and explores some of the challenges that this view poses to our common sense understanding of certain attributes, like consciousness and free will, that ascribe to ourselves as human beings.  This course has a laboratory component.

COREI-AD 31 From Ancient Cosmology to Science: Chinese, Indian, and Western Traditions This course considers the origins of science in ancient cosmologies. What principles are preserved? Considering the classical Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, the question of how and to what extent culture determines the paradigms of science is investigated. We begin with formative texts from the Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, including the Rig Veda, the Upanishads (India), the I Jing, Dao De Jing, and the neo-Confucian synthesis (China) and the pre-Socratic Ionian physicists (Western), then turn to the development of modern science.  Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read in parallel with seminal texts describing the rise of modern science in China and India. The course will conclude with a survey of contemporary cosmological theories to see how some ancient ideas are retained in modern science.

COREI-AD 32W Global Warming and Local Weather This course examines the Earth's climate and in particular how it evolved in the past and is likely to change in the future. We first consider weather patterns around the globe and ask whether the occurrence of “weird weather” corresponds to the emergence of worldwide disruption. Then we study physical processes, such as radiation, clouds, and wind, that are at the core of both weather and climate, and discuss how human activities can affect them. Finally, we use this understanding to consider predictions of future climate change, the impact on different parts of the globe, possible remedies and how they might be implemented.

COREI-AD 33 Snap Judgments Daily experience attests that the briefest of glances at other people often suffices to furnish a wealth of socially relevant information about them. From minimal visual cues, for instance, we can infer group memberships (e.g., sex and age), emotional states, personality traits, and even a person’s intentions. The dexterity with which humans deduce such knowledge has fascinated ancient philosophers and contemporary thinkers alike. As a result, much thought has been dedicated towards a process that typically unfolds within less than a second. Based on this work, films, literary texts, and scientific evidence are presented to explore the perceptual, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that underlie common snap judgments in person evaluation. The accuracy of these judgments, their neural foundation, and the societal consequences of rapidly assessing others are discussed.

COREI-AD 34 From Vision to Visual In 300 BC, Euclid first described Vision as the process by which rays traveled in a straight line from the eye to the object seen. Since ancient times, our curiosity about vision has propelled the invention of tools to enlarge information that could not be perceived with the naked eye and to make sense of the world around us. This course explores the development of optics and its influence on visual communication. How has our understanding of vision been communicated and changed over time? How successful have we been in “visualizing” the visual network that we are concurrently studying and trying to decipher? As we shed light on the visual code, we will highlight the importance of visualization tools in advancing scientific research. Has film informed or misinformed the science of visual perception and is there such a thing as the "objective eye?"

COREI-AD 35 Seven Wonders of the Invisible World “In the year of 1657 I discovered very small living creatures in rain water.” This quote is attributed to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch merchant whose skillful use of glass lenses allowed him to peer into a world of microorganisms that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. His careful observations gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed  structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. A special emphasis will be placed on capturing images of seven wonders of the invisible world - natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins and naturally-occurring crystals.  This course has a laboratory component.

COREI-AD 38J Introduction to Imaging Spectroscopy in the Study of Old Master Paintings Works of art, like all objects, absorb, emit and reflect light at specific wavelengths. This gives every object its own unique pattern, known as its spectral signature. Imaging spectroscopy enables us to image these spectral signatures, and the subsequent processing of these images allows the analysis and identification of materials to take place without the need to sample the object. Imaging spectroscopy was developed for the remote sensing of the Earth and more recently Mars, and has in the last decade been applied to the study of works of art in ways not before possible. In this short course students will be introduced by a leading imaging scientist to imaging spectroscopy, and will apply it to study the materials and working methods of medieval and Renaissance painters.  Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of the scientific method by examination of several paintings in the Acton Collection at NYU-Florence, Villa la Pietra, will learn about how scientists and conservators work together to interpret the resulting data, and will expand their knowledge of the history of art and artists' materials.

COREI-AD 39 Complexity Underlying the order of natural systems and the simple rules they would appear to follow, is complexity born from the large number of objects under consideration and the functional connections between these objects at hierarchies of scale. The science of complexity, and goal of this course, concerns how to model such systems as connected networks so that we may understand better how the objects of disparate systems become self-organized, robust to disruption, and connected by links that increase in number/length according to common mathematical power laws. Topics for discussion are drawn from physical (e.g., geology, astronomy), biological (e.g., ecology, medicine), and social (e.g., economy, communications) systems. A consideration of the complexity of our own neural network, evincing conscious and unconscious benefits and hindrances to our behavior, will highlight an appreciation for the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon we call creativity, which characterizes our search for new unknowns in science.

COREI-AD 40 Idea of the Cell Proteins and organic compounds came together over three billion years ago to form the first cell. However, we have only been able to see cells for approximately 300 years through the microscope. In the early days of cellular imaging, the cell body was figuratively represented as buzzing cities or mythological realms. Today, the power of electron microscopy and animation reveal more details about the inner life of cells than ever before, and yet subjective and singular interpretations of the cell have persisted. This course explores cellular identity in the context of visual imagery and advances in visualization. Students will express their own ideas of the cell by creating original short films.

COREI-AD 41J Protecting the World's Health: Triumphs and Challenges This course offers students an introduction to the key principles and practices of public health using four epidemics as learning tools: the eradication of smallpox, the AIDs epidemic, polio eradication efforts and the global epidemic of tobacco use. These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco).  The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic's scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 42 Uncertainty in Science Science is fundamentally about exploring the unknown, and a major part of being a scientist is learning how to handle uncertainty. Statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, the range of validity of models, approximations, data outliers, competing interpretations: scientists spend most of their time wrestling with these problems. Unfortunately, in classrooms and in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. If uncertainty is acknowledged, it is often portrayed as an argument between two groups of experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well established facts, and scientists occasionally have clear-cut divisions of opinion, more commonly they have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about the significance of a particular measurement or study. In this class, we familiarize ourselves with the language of probability and statistics, explore how it developed historically to become central to the scientific process, and how it is used by different scientific disciplines. We discuss how scientists express their ignorance, and how individuals and policy makers can still make judgments based on incomplete scientific knowledge. We also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs. Finally, we discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, we can still put limits on our uncertainty.

COREI-AD 43 Behavior Why we behave in a certain way is one of the most fascinating and complex questions and one that we often cannot even explain to ourselves. So what drives behavior? How can behavior be measured? And can behavior be changed? This course will examine behavior from the viewpoints of biology, neuroscience, economics, psychology and philosophy. We will place an emphasis on interpreting and designing experiments that measure behavior in both humans and animals.

Numbers pervade our lives, so it may seem self-evident what they are. But like languages, technologies or ideologies, numbers have a history, and understanding of them has changed over time and also been surprisingly controversial.  Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers.  Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality.  Reading these authors will help us understand why even today’s science has no definitive answer to the apparently simple question about its faithful servants: what is a number?

COREI-AD 45W Progress in Science Science is a social enterprise, although one traditionally thought to be grounded in facts and reason. Scientists collaborate with each other, undermine one another, and compete for funding of research. Whether a scientific idea ever sees the light of day may depend on these distinctly social factors. So how much of what we call ‘scientific progress’ is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates—the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? We'll examine this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. Our starting point will be Thomas Kuhn’s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, we’ll consider why many scientific revolutions occurred in Europe and not elsewhere. Are some cultural and social features more hospitable than others to scientific inquiry?   This course is writing intensive.

COREI-AD 46 Languages Our guiding question emerges from the story of Babel:  why are there many languages?  Should we view linguistic diversity on par with superficial cultural differences, as reflecting essential differences in modes of thinking, or as products of incommensurate world views?  This question will be explored across disciplines, from the philosophical discussion of the (im)possibility of translation, through the literary theoretic debate about the connection between speech and writing, to recent discussions in psychology and anthropology about linguistic determinism (language determining thought or culture determining language).  These debates across intellectual traditions center around the key question of the source of linguistic universals:  do commonalities among languages reflect an innate brain "organ" or do they reflect commonalities in human culture and in general human cognitive capabilities.  The linguist’s argument for an innate universal grammar invites us to view language history in biblical terms, as the cultural fall from a single original language, fixed by biology, but such biological determinism is also consistent with the idea that the multi-lingual cosmopolitan human has always been our natural state.

COREI-AD 47 Heat and the Universe This course asks what temperature reveals about the past and future of our species, planet and universe. Scientific measurements of temperature only began in the 17th century and the meaning of temperature was not fully understood until the 19th century. We will examine how that understanding developed and how temperature came to provide a key ingredient in the scientific toolbox. Its study will be used as a unifying guide to examine a wide range of phenomena in our natural world, from the cooling of the Universe in the first minutes of its expansion after the Big Bang to the role that temperature fluctuations have played in the Earth’s history and the threats posed by global warming. Biological adaptations to different degrees of hot and cold will be examined through the action of heat and cold loving bacteria and through the techniques mammals have adopted for temperature regulation. Readings will be in the history of science and in both primary and secondary sources in physics, astronomy, biology and geology.

COREI-AD 48J Big Data from Gauss to Genomics and Facebook Big Data is the science of large data sets. These sets have appeared in rising volume, variety and velocity during the last decade. The rise of big data is due chiefly to data collection via social networks, E-commerce and web navigation, but other types of data collection, related to phones, medicine or world trade are also involved. How do we get relevant information from these large data sets? For example, based on a very accurate analysis of their own collected data sets, companies as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Netflix manage to get significant hints about what should interest specific customers. Data analysis is also becoming more important in healthcare with personalized medicine. This course takes a cross-disciplinary approach to Big Data, beginning with the sources and applications of Big Data, such as business, genomics, economics, and sociology. Then, we will look at how statistics and computer science (via machine learning) aid the analysis of data sets. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 49J Science in Flux: The Galilean Revolution How does science develop and change? What sorts of considerations are used to assess and evaluate scientific theories, particularly when those theories upend our entire picture of the physical world and our place in it? Are there factors that go beyond the empirical data itself, such as broader conceptual and religious considerations? And are these ‘extra-empirical’ considerations legitimate constraints on scientific inquiry? This course will examine these big questions about the nature of science in the context of Galileo’s groundbreaking theory on the nature of motion—a theory that laid the groundwork for Newton and the rise of modern science. We will look at the many conflicts in which Galileo became embroiled—scientific, religious, and personal—and study the historical developments that eventually led to widespread acceptance of the Galilean worldview. Our aim will be to understand the complicated way in which Galileo’s physics emerged, was resisted, and eventually triumphed, and to situate that evolution within a broader narrative about the nature of scientific development and change. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 51J Biomimetics How does nature serve as a model for the design of synthetic materials? Biomimetics is defined as the structure and function of biological systems as models for the design and engineering of materials.This introductory course reviews the complexities in natural materials following millions of years of evolution and how efficient they are in comparison to  standard engineering materials in performing specific tasks.  The course  will also present students with the basic concepts of engineering  materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors) and their structure/property relationship and how current manufacturing techniques  inspire scientists to recreate nature-like structures to improve current engineering practice.  The course is geared to the classroom and  experimental laboratory setting where students manipulate materials and  explore material properties for biomimetic design. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 52J Computational Tools for Cultural Comparison Different cultures have both unique and common properties.  These can be linguistic properties, properties of politeness, of government, of art, of economics, of food, of gender relationships, and even of war. Tools for cross-cultural comparison should allow those who are familiar with only a few cultures to enter properties and values about those cultures and then allow searchers to compare the cultures in various ways. For example, it should be possible to discover the commonalities and differences among pairs of cultures, to cluster many cultures based on their commonalities, and to find cultural rules of the form "if culture has property x, then it has property y".  This course will begin with the discussion of a key cultural notion-- language. You will learn the basics of linguistics and then will interact with a cross-cultural database and analysis platform called Terraling. We will also study data sets that may be useful for cross-cultural analysis mostly from the social sciences, anthropology, and archaeology.  After that, you will engage in projects to use Terraling to enter other properties and values about a topic of your choice (e.g. about food, legal structure etc.). Some of that data will come from the data sets others have gathered that are on the web and some will come from data that you yourselves gather. In the process you will learn elements of statistics, machine learning, programming in Python, and experimental design and evaluation. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 53 About Mathematics Mathematics takes its problems from the real world and puts order into chaos. It sometimes strongly challenges common sense and produces extraordinary dreams of human history.  The course concerns questions and concepts from various areas in mathematics, in particular number theory: the ``alarm clock numbers'' and some of their applications (for example to music) ; irrational numbers and their intimate links with art and geometry as well as the scandal raised by their discovery in ancient Greece ; the Golden Ratio with its surprising mathematical properties, its connections with biology through Fibonacci sequences and art history; prime numbers and their chaos, order and mystery ; the fantastic number π, some of its properties, and messy and beautiful formulae to approach it ; continued fractions, the sum of two-squares theorem ; the five (or three) Platonic solids from prehistory to modern times ; some amazing paradoxes raised by probabilities ; and Poincaré finite-infinite universe. Through these and other examples we will consider how and why mathematics is a subversive intellectual activity, relying on passion, imagination, and beauty as much as on logic and rigorous argumentation.

COREI-AD 54 Diversity This course will investigate two fundamental concepts: Identity, “Who am I?”, and Diversity, “How am I different from other human beings?” These questions will be addressed from cultural, environmental and biological perspectives. We will examine the origin of human diversity, how human diversity is measured and analyzed, and how our perception of diversity has changed through history. Emphasis will be placed on recent progress in genetics and evolution and how this progress affects our daily life and identity. Students will learn how genes can inform us about human history, ancestry and evolution. The laboratory component of the course will demonstrate how data are generated and analyzed, and will explore the difficulty encountered by scientists in inferring processes from observations and experiments. Students will have the option to collect and analyze genetic data from their own genome. This course has a laboratory component.

COREI-AD 55W Disease and Society How have diseases, and efforts to control them, shaped the nature and course of human societies? Are diseases actors in their own right? What determines who falls sick and who dies? This course explores the complex relationship between disease and society, between the natural and social worlds. Our focus is on understanding how people have explained, argued about, and responded to diseases in different social contexts over time. The course readings consist of books drawn from a range of disciplines. This course is writing intensive.

And can your DNA sequence be used to develop personalized treatments? Healthcare is arguably the most important place where science meets society, and technical advances in science are raising important ethical issues about healthcare, such as genetic discrimination and designer babies. This course will look at the science, economics and politics behind medicine and healthcare systems, and use medicine as a tool to study the relative roles of the individual and government.

COREP-AD 01 A Thousand and One Nights For centuries The 1001 Nights (or Arabian Nights) has served as a point of encounter between Middle Eastern literary traditions and the cultural politics of Western literary and artistic production and translation. This course examines the much-debated history of the Nights and the cross-cultural exchange that has seen the tales adapted for distinct audiences in medieval Egypt and Syria, modern Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.

COREP-AD 01W 1001 Nights: Culture and Difference This course focuses on questions of religious and cultural difference through the 1001 Nights and related texts. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and ‘pagan’ realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah’s Cosmopolitanism and Said’s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland’s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

COREP-AD 02 Discovery and Recognition in Narrative, Film, and Drama Across all cultures, stories are fashioned to withhold information at first, holding our attention through suspense. They then produce disclosures at crucial moments of denouement. For Aristotle, this dynamic movement from ignorance to knowledge is essential, especially when it takes the form of the discovery—or recognition—of previously unknown identity. Tracing an arc from the ancient world to the present day, students study how the epistemology of modern storytelling across cultures disturbs the familiar patterns of clear and comforting revelation associated with classic genres. Readings include: Aristotle’s Poetics; Oedipus Rex; the Odyssey; the Old Testament; the Gospels of Mark and John; the Qur’an; the Arabian Nights; Shakespeare’s King Lear; Naguib Mahfouz; and films from the 1940s to the present.   Fall 2012; 14 Weeks Philip Kennedy - UW, 11:20-12:35 Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREP-AD 03W Journeys The search for knowledge has been linked historically to the traveler’s experience of new places and peoples. Travel necessitates the creation of translations that reveal how knowledge of otherness necessarily involves comparison to home and self. Drawing on texts that represent travel in realistic, figurative, and fantastic terms, we explore the idea that a journey entails the discovery, not only of a destination, but also of the self. As Rilke wrote, “There is only one journey. Going inside yourself.”   This course is writing intensive.

COREP-AD 04W Reimagining Nature For the first time in human history, the weather is about us.  Growing scientific evidence of catastrophic—and anthropogenic— climate change brings new urgency to an old question: how do we humans conceive of our relationship to “nature”? This course explores how imaginative writers have situated the human in relation to Earth’s many landscapes, plants, climates, and species. How have they depicted meaningful encounters between humans and the other animals? What have they suggested about humans’ responsibilities to the countless other living beings with whom we share this planet? How have they “mapped” the slippery and shifting conceptual ground that lies between the “man-made” and the “natural”? And how might a renewed engagement with this vast theme help us deal with the heavy weather ahead? Readings include Gilgamesh, Genesis, Bacchae, Narrow Road to the North, Walden, Island of Dr. Moreau, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Life of Pi. This course is writing intensive.

COREP-AD 10 Cities: Writing the Urban Space Cities hold a special fascination for writers as the most complex form of social organization. This course investigates the various ways in which writers have represented the dynamics of city life. Topics to be investigated include the use of cities as philosophical points of departure by such thinkers as Plato and St. Augustine; the development of mnemonics as a response to the challenges of urban space; the decline in representations of the city during the European Middle Ages; the inescapability of the city in post-Enlightenment Western Literature; and the depiction of cities in non-Western texts and films.

COREP-AD 11 Other Worlds: Cosmography, Utopias, Travel Accounts This course investigates the representation of other worlds in texts and films. Whether depicted as matters of fact (as in cosmography), as a projection of ideal conditions in opposition to one’s own world (as in utopias), or as a mixed blessing when a person meets with circumstances that put everything he knows about the world at risk (as in travel accounts), other worlds offer the opportunity to investigate the encounter with difference as a fundamental aspect of human experience.

What is the relationship of people to their landscape and environment? What is the relationship of technology to cultural production? How do gender and sexuality define or liberate us? And, ultimately, does the artist have an obligation to address any of these issues in his/her work?

Religions have theirs, societies theirs, families theirs. Business has its rules and contracts. How do people understand the laws that are as much a part of life as the weather? Literature—the work of the imagination—guides our great journey towards understanding. Writers dramatize the relations among law, justice, and freedom. Writers also show the effect of law on the fates, fortunes, and feelings of people. The course explores the power of literature to show us what the law is, what it should not be, and what it might be.

COREP-AD 14 Cosmopolitan Imagination Originating in the idea of the world citizen and conceived in contradistinction to nationalism, cosmopolitanism can be understood as a perspective that regards human difference as an opportunity to be embraced rather than a problem to be solved.

COREP-AD 19W Myth, Magic, and Representations of Childhood Using some classics of children’s literature from countries around the world, including several novels from the Harry Potter series, students examine the ways in which children’s literature offers insight into contemporary culture, particularly concerns about power and politics. Course readings include fairy tales and myths from around the world, as well as writings from theorists and philosophers who have used these “children’s stories” to analyze and explain aspects of the human experience. Focusing on questions of genre, influence, and intertextuality, students explore how—or if—“children’s literature” ultimately offers a more cosmopolitan perspective than literature intended solely for adults.

COREP-AD 21 Families The family has often been described as the nucleus of society. The course studies the representation of families—both biological and symbolic—as a source of blessings and burdens, bonding and betrayal in literary texts from around the world, starting with the Odyssey and moving on through the Middle Ages to modern writing. The course also investigates modern theories of the family as found in the works of such thinkers as Engels, Freud, and Foucault.

COREP-AD 22 Changing Notions of Race in Literature This course examines a wide variety of literary texts on black-white couples, interracial families, and biracial identity, from classical antiquity to the present. Works studied include romances, novellas, plays, novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction, as well as some films and examples from the visual arts. Topics for discussion range from interracial genealogies to racial “passing,” from representations of racial difference to alternative plot resolutions, and from religious and political to legal and scientific contexts for the changing understanding of “race.” Spring 1 2012; 7 Weeks Werner Sollors - UW, 9:55-12:35 Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 1 2014; 7 Weeks Werner Sollors - TR, 10:00-12:30 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREP-AD 23 Doubles and Masks Among the more significant activities of human beings is that of giving shape to fears and desires through art.  All cultures participate in this form of emotional exteriorization, including creating “doubles” and “masks” through myths, literature, and other media.  Concentrating on doubles and masks in several different cultures, we will chart the meaning and impact of the archetypal masked figures of the commedia dell’arte in French and British theatre; the obsessive concern with the grotesque (the monstrous mask) in French romanticism and in Haitian magical realism; zombification, carnival figures, and ghostly doubles in Latin American, North American, and African cultural forms.  We build a repertory of approaches to interpreting and uncovering the many layers of masking and doubling by reading in anthropology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and literary theory.  Students in the NYUNY Comparative Literature Dept: This course counts for either a Comparative Literature specialization course or for an elective.

COREP-AD 24W Contagion How do we respond to news that some among us are ill, and that the illness is, perhaps, contagious? Are the healthy ethically obliged to tend to the sick? What are the relationships between contagious disease and verbal communication: rumors, medical information, stories about the dying and the dead? How has illness literally and metaphorically participated in the reimagination of community, kinship, and sexuality in different times and places? This course examines the intersections of contagious disorder and storytelling in a range of cultures, settings, and forms, from ancient Greece to contemporary South Africa, from the Black Death, influenza, and AIDS to the proliferation of zombies and vampires in global popular culture today.

COREP-AD 25W World as Text How do you write a history of the world?  What is the relationship between history and storytelling?  How do we fashion meaning in history and interpret other civilizations? This course looks for answers to these questions in the first great histories of the known world, Herodotus’s Histories and Sima Qian’s Records of the Historian.  Addressing world history from the vantage point of ancient Greece and Ancient China, these works gave narrative an unprecedented geographical scope and acquired a textual authority previously enjoyed only by epics and chronicles.  They also yielded model accounts of cultural difference that have influenced other narrative forms in fiction and non-fiction, textual and visual culture - to this day.  In addition to Herodotus and Sima Qian, readings include selections from Homer and early Chinese chronicles, as well as contemporary historical fiction (such as Gore Vidal’s Creation), the films Hero and The Emperor and the Assassin, and journalist Ryszard Kapuściński's memoir and travelogue Travels with Herodotus.

They have transformed human destiny since the beginning of time. They are rolling spaces of experimentation and exchange,  hope and heartbreak, where peoples’ engagement with each other has unfolded, where humans have tussled with nature and interpreted the divine. Human interactions with oceans have spurred trade, set the boundaries of nations, built empires, redistributed populations, redefined tastes in food, produced new forms of art and music, transmitted diseases, and triggered new ideas and innovations in politics, law, science and technology. Above all, oceans continue to carry – and all too often thwart – the dreams of becoming and belonging of humans on the move. This course will explore the ways in which literary works across many genres – novels, plays, and poetry – have portrayed human relationships with oceans. It will prompt you to ask: how has the ocean functioned as a metaphor for the individual’s connection with nature and society? In what ways do depictions of oceans commemorate or comment upon a panoply of human experiences through time?  What affect and emotions do they encode? What identities do they create?

In addition to exploring Shakespeare’s plays and poetry, the course also examines texts and films (e.g., Cesaire’s A Tempest, Robbins’s West Side Story, and Kurosawa’s Ran) that appropriate, rewrite, or write back to Shakespeare’s work and consider the processes that have made Shakespeare into an institution of culture worldwide.

"A magic curtain, woven of legends, hung before the world," writes Milan Kundera, "Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore the curtain." Is enchantment possible after modernity? And if so, what form might it take? A reenchantment as foreseen by religious cosmography, in which the human realm intersects with that of jinn or other supernatural beings? Or might the discoveries and technologies of the modern world--including the laws of physics and breakthroughs in science--themselves be conceived as enchanting? This course looks at attempts from various cultural vantage points to reconcile magic and realism in the aftermath of secularism and modernity. Must enchantment survive only as an escape from reason? Or might it be compatible with the Enlightenment and scientific inquiry? We will look at responses to the riddle of magic in modern society in the art, theatre, film and fiction of Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.

COREP-AD 29 Reading the Body: Physiognomy, Body Language and Facial Expression Reading the body in terms of physiognomy used to be a respected field of (natural) philosophy as well as common practice from ancient times onwards and around the globe. A (pseudo-)Aristotelian treatise and Pliny’s extensive writing on the subject in his Natural History, Chinese Tang-period perceptions and Japanese/Korean scholarship (as documented in The Tale of Genji) give sufficient proof of the ubiquity of the subject’s dignity. The course will trace physiognomic patterns as a means to establish individual identity (e.g. Genji, Parzival) as well as otherness (e.g. Polo, Staden), starting with these texts and continuing through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It was only in the age of Enlightenment that severe criticism arose, branding physiognomy a pseudo-science and leaving only body language and facial expression as serious fields of empirical study. Modern cognitive science, however, has brought the subject back with a vengeance. Fall 2012; 14 Weeks Wolfgang Neuber - MW, 1:10-2:25 Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREP-AD 30 Mortal and Immortal Questions We will read a wide-ranging selection of works from different cultures and chronological periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about what it means to be a human being faced with death.   We will examine the attitudes and actions of characters struggling to understand the meaning of death and who must decide whether they believe that death is an evil that harms them or is something they should just ignore. We will also consider the ways in which their views about immortality affect their actions and whether a desire for immortality has beneficial or detrimental affects on their lives and the lives of people around them.  More generally, we will be looking at some of the ways that different authors and cultures treat the question of how significant one’s death is to the continuing existence of others and what it means in different times and places to say that someone has died. Readings will include Euripides, Plato, Lucretius, Kyokai, Boccaccio, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Marquez, Morrison, Barnes, Salih, Hariharan, and Kanafani.

The formulation ‘nation and narration’ envisages both the construction of the nation as narration and the imaginings of the nation in narrative (historical and literary). To capture a sense of the wide-ranging connections between nation and narration we track, through a variety of texts across cultures, periods and genres, the spread of the idea of the modern nation from Europe to the rest of the world; the struggles of anti-colonial nationalisms; the birth of postcolonial nation-states; their subsequent trials and tribulations; the rhetoric of nationalism; the critiques of nationalism; the voices of minorities, immigrants and indigenous peoples that disrupt a homogeneous ‘national culture’; the phenomena of transnationalism and globalization; and their implications for the future of the nation-state. Readings and films to be studied include: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Half of a Yellow Sun; Assia Djebar, Fantasia, an Algerian Cavalcade; Dave Eggers, What is the What; D.W. Griffith, Birth of the Nation;  Michael Ondaatje, English Patient; Salman Rushdie, Midnight’s Children;  William Shakespeare, King Henry; and Rabindranath Tagore, Home and the World.  Students in the NYUNY Comparative Literature Dept: This course counts for either a Comparative Literature specialization course or for an elective.

COREP-AD 32 Stigma Societies develop cultural behaviors that indicate the relative value of its members. Social acceptance has been historically dependent on its mutually constitutive term—ostracism—as members act on how they perceive and maintain their status in relationship to others. In this class, we will read novels, memoirs and plays that examine and deconstruct how systems of social worth operate, and how the nuances of those systems create and enforce devalued categories of people.  Readings focus on works that consider the specific attributes that adhere to the historically stigmatized categories of illness and disability.  We will discover how stigma affects feelings of self-worth and mediates engagement with others. Sociologist Erving Goffman observed that stigma creates “spoiled identities.”  Using ideas offered in Goffman’s seminal text on stigma, anthropologist Mary Douglas’s work on pollution and taboo, our readings will focus on authors who deconstruct experiences of stigma, and who write in order to destabilize, revise, and repair the personal and social damage stigmatizing categories and behaviors inflict.

COREP-AD 33 Quest for Knowledge Humanity’s need to make sense of itself and its place in the universe has generated the world’s oldest creation stories and its most enduring myths. The quest for knowledge has itself also been a perennial theme of world literature. This course examines the impulse to construct knowledge in a variety of time periods and cultural traditions, raising questions about how human communities around the world have conceived of the nature, conditions, limits, and means of acquiring knowledge. Readings include ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian myths, The Epic of Gilgamesh (Mesopotamia), The Bhagavad Gita (India), Plato’s “Allegory of the Cave” (Greece), Farid ud-Din Attar’s The Conference of the Birds (Persia), Murasaki Shikibu’s The Tale of Genji (Japan), Cao Xueqin’s Dream of the Red Chamber (China), Sigmund Freud’s “Dora” (Austria), Alberto Mussa’s The Riddle of Qaf (Brazil), and short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle (Britain), Jorge Luis Borges (Argentina), and Naguib Mahfouz (Egypt).

COREP-AD 34 Autobiography: Ideas of the Self in a Global World Storytelling is a way for humans to understand the world and their position in it. This is particularly true for those who write to tell their own life stories. In this course, we will explore how these self-narratives allow their authors to comprehend their position in a globally connected world. We will read autobiographies by public figures and private citizens from different traditions and time periods who travel away from home and then write about their experience. Readings include Augustine’s Confessions (4th century), Al-Ghazali’s Deliverance from Error (11th century), Margery Kempe’s memoirs (15th century), Catalina de Erauso’s Memoirs of a Basque Lieutenant Nun (17th century), Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Confessions (18th century), Olaudah Equiano’s Interesting Narrative (18th century), N.O. Body’s Memoirs of a Man’s Maiden Years (1907), Buchi Emecheta’s Head Above Water (1986), Edward Said’s Out of Place (2000), and Sophia Al-Maria’s The Girl Who Fell to Earth (2012).

COREP-AD 35 Exile, Diaspora, and Migration Diaspora has also been a recurring feature of human history since the dispersal of Jews from the Middle East, of Africans during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, or of the Irish during the Great Hunger. In the past two centuries, millions have migrated from their homelands to work or find refuge in far-away countries with cultures very different from their own. How do human beings come to terms with such conditions and transformations in their lives? What are the cultural, emotional, and intellectual effects of being exiled from your place of birth? How far can loss be compensated for by the idea that something can also be gained? In this course we consider connections and differences between experiences of exile, diaspora, and migration by examining stories and writing about them in the Bible, the Odyssey, and texts by Plutarch, Ovid, Dante, Byron, Dostoevsky, Conrad, Césaire, Naipaul, Rhys, Lamming, Carpentier, Darwish, Edward Said, Julia Alvarez and Kiran Desai.   Spring 2014; 14 Weeks Robert JC Young - TR, 8:30-9:45 am Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 2015; 14 Weeks Robert JC Young - MW, 9:15 - 10:30 am; MW 10:40 - 11:55 am Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

COREP-AD 36W Rogue Fictions: Tales of Tricksters, Outlaws, and Outsiders From mythological figures such as Coyote in North America, Hermes of Greek Myth and Eshu in West Africa, to modern icons of global pop culture like Charlie Chaplin, Bugs Bunny, and Bart Simpson, humans have long been fascinated with trickster characters who transgress boundaries, break rules, and unsettle fixed truths. Seemingly heedless of cultural norms, these characters in their many different guises point to the important role of play and disruption in the making of culture. In this course, students will consider rogues, outlaws, and outsiders of various types from around the world and their portrayal in stories, novels, dramas, songs, and films. Building a repertoire of trickster characters, types, and tropes, students examine how these characters’ dynamic roles relate to central problems of art, creativity, and life. This course is writing intensive.

COREP-AD 37 Reflecting the Self: Autobiography and Memoirs Autobiographies and memoirs (both a subgroup of socalled ego documents) are commonly taken to be “authentic” and “objective” representations of what the author lived through – but they are not. Both genres are literary texts to which the distinction between an author and a narrator (the “I”) applies. Both genres concern themselves with a reflection of the self in contexts that vary across history and civilisations. They may be concerned with the development of the persona in terms of identity, religion, intellectual achievements, political conditions, etc. Autobiography differs from memoir in scope, the first being more comprehensive and pertaining to the development of the “I”, the latter concentrating on a crucial event in history as perceived by the “I”. The course traces the genres from the very first documents in history to the present day, spanning a large variety of civilisations: from Greek and Roman antiquity, the Middle Ages in Arab, European, and Indian cultures, the Italian Renaissance and the Enlightenment on to examples from American, Indian, European, Japanese, Chinese, and Iranian authors.

COREP-AD 38 Money and the Good Life This course examines a variety of cultural conceptions of money and wealth, and the ethical questions that money or wealth allows a writer to probe. Is the value of men measured by the value of their money, or are there other criteria for wealth? Is someone’s wealth possible without someone else’s poverty? How is human ambition rewarded or punished in the “pecuniary culture”? The course looks for answers to these and other questions in key works of literature, sociology, economics and other fields, reading classical texts ranging from Aristophanes' Plutus, Ihara Saikaku's "A dose of what the doctor never orders," and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, to Honoré de Balzac's Père Goriot, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. Readings will be supplemented by excerpts from works by Ibn Khaldun, Adam Smith, Thorstein Veblen, Max Weber, and Alfred Hirshman.

COREP-AD 39 Bodies in Pain: Literary Representations of Disease and Health As the Arabic saying goes, “Health is a crown worn by the healthy and seen only by the ill.” Throughout history, literature has staged the human struggle with disease and the related search for a cure. This course depicts the literary representation of pathologies and their medical treatments, ranging from eighteenth-century European treatises on the “English Malady” to the depiction of tuberculosis and leprosy in twentieth-century Japan. In the attempt to restore health, the relationship between patient and doctor is of central importance and therefore constitutes a thematic focus for this course. Readings will include: George Cheyne’s The English Malady, Franz Kafka’s “Country Doctor,” Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” Yahya Hakki’s Lamp of Umm Hashim, Bernard Pomerance’s The Elephant Man, Albert Camus’ The Plague, Sigmund Freud’s Dora, Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “Yellow Wallpaper,” Ernest Hemingway’s “Indian Camp,” Gail Tsukiyama’s The Samurai’s Garden, and Sanjay Gupta’s Monday Mornings.

COREP-AD 41 The Soul The theme of this class will be the discovery and exploration of the concept of the soul in the religious and philosophic traditions of the Mediterranean.  We will focus on the great questions about the soul--the conscious self and its identity-- persisting up to and perhaps beyond death:  What is it to be a person in a body?  Is there something that is our essential self, independent of the body? Is this something conscious? Does it include the mind? Does it survive death? How exactly?  Will it be judged, as Plato and Socrates thought and many religions suggest? We will explore these ideas from the Greeks through the Christians and Muslims, reading Homer, Plato, Augustine and Ibn Sina.  The class will conclude with a glimpse at the late Renaissance, when the permanence and even presence of human souls became more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in the ancient and medieval worlds.  In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way, whether to faith--or away from it.

Animals have been deified and demonised, petted and abused, cherished and exploited. While modern science is increasingly blurring the supposed demarcation line between animals (equalling nature) and humans (equalling reason), literature has allowed for transgressions that have worked both ways: transformations go from human to animal and vice versa. Not only this; throughout history animals have been thought to possess human qualities (and also: vice versa) such as speech and reason and have been represented to act in a way that often seems more human than the way humans behave. The class starts with the earliest literary document of mankind, The Epic of Gilgamesh, looks at texts from Antiquity and the Middle Ages from various civilisations (Aesopus, The Jataka Tales, The Panchatantra, Apuleius, Lucian, The Physiologus, The Journey to the West) and up to modern times (Darwin, Carroll, Kipling, Kafka, Dick) and also one film which especially reflects upon the strained relationship to an animal and man’s self-perception in the face of nature (Moby Dick).

COREP-AD 43W Knowledge and Doubt We will explore the relation of knowledge and doubt in a wide variety of texts in different genres, historical periods, and cultural contexts. Some our questions will be about sources of knowledge and evidence, while others will be about the nature of our capacities for knowing things. Questions include:  what sources of knowledge can we trust, if any? Are there ways to achieve knowledge by transcending our normal sensory and rational capacities?  Might we be systematically deceived about the world and, if so, could we still find happiness in such a condition? Is our knowledge inevitably dependent on others or are our best sources of knowledge found within?  How can our knowledge be distorted by strong emotions such as hatred or love? Readings will be from Mo-Tzu, Sophocles, Nagarjuna, Ibn Tufayl, Dante, Montaigne, Cervantes, Descartes, Hume, Rousseau, and Proust. This course is writing intensive.

Why do we laugh, and what does it mean? How does laughter function within us as individuals, in our local circles, and as a global community? What evokes laughter that transcends culture, and what is culturally specific? In this course students will confront laughter and its capacity to disarm, connect, heal, teach, debunk, humiliate, reform, confront, expose, progress, politicize, humanize, and empower. The course readings will include literature, visual art, theater, film, television, animation, new media, psychology, and biology. Students will encounter such artists, writers and thinkers as Nasreddin Hoca, Aristophanes, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Margaret Cho, Jim Henson, Frida Kahlo, Oscar Wilde, Jane Austen, Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, Joss Whedon, Tina Fey, and Takashi Murakami.

COREP-AD 45 Narrative and (Un)knowing The fundamental question we will probe in this course is how narratives represent our coming to know.  Ever since the Enlightenment, the West typically assumes knowing to be the achievement of a rational subject moving progressively through lawful space and time—and figuring things out.  Only a lawful world allows the questing subject to arrive at knowledge and self-knowledge.  This progressive story serves as a central target of modernist and postcolonial critique.  Writers such as Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kafka, Freud, Faulkner, and Beckett call into question the narrative of the knowing Western subject.  Garcia-Marquez’s postcolonial One Hundred Years of Solitude simply dispenses with Western priorities of knowing and self-knowledge.

COREP-AD 46W Extinction Scientists believe that our planet is experiencing its sixth mass extinction (the fifth, caused by a meteor collision, occurred 65 million years ago).  Many even have called for the recognition of a new epoch, the Anthropocene, to mark the massive impact of human activities and human-induced extinctions on its biosphere.  But how do we make sense of this era’s accelerating rate of species death?  What is the relationship between the extinction of a species and the extinction of cultures, languages, and lifeways?  How have biodiversity loss, language death, the vanishing of “savage races” and aboriginal populations, genocide, and the specter of self-extinction shaped our understanding of what it means to be human?  This course examines the human encounter with biotic, cultural, and metaphorical extinctions in a variety of genres, from Darwin’s reflections aboard the Beagle to the preservation of Ishi (“the last wild Indian),” and from flood narratives to apocalyptic fantasies.  This course is writing intensive.

It was, however,  not until Freud’s insights into the subjective nature of dreams and especially neuroscience’s explorations of the material basis of dreams and their cognitive function, that dreams were considered to belong in the realm of metaphysics. Thus, they served supernatural powers as a vehicle for prophecy and premonition. Literature has made use of these specific qualities in order to reflect on the dreaming persons’ ethical motivations, impulses to act, finding their identity, being deluded or informed and changing their ways. The class spans texts and one film (Kubrick) that represent dreams, either literally or metaphorically, from Antiquity (Cicero) to the present day (Borges) and across a variety of civilisations.

COREP-AD 48 Humans Deformed and Transformed All cultures attempt to define what it is to be human. In the process, all cultures ponder individuals who do not fit definitions of the human—individuals who fall short or soar above their peers by commingling human with nonhuman ways and forms of being. Werewolves, wild men, fox women, and bird people test human nature against other natures. Sometimes these creatures find human nature lacking, and supplement the lack by reaching out into other natures; other times their transformations stage confrontations between civilization and chaos. We will survey how poets and narrative artists have imagined the commingling of humanity and non-humanity across several centuries and cultures. What are the attractions of getting beyond, or sinking below, the limits of the human? How do cultures set those limits? What resources does literature offer for thinking about self-definition in relation to social responsibility?   Spring 1 2015; 7 Weeks Susan Crane - MW, 2:10 - 4:50 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

China, India, and the Philippines are sending most migrants; the most important host areas are Europe and the United States; and expats make up more than 60% of the total population in Qatar and the UAE. How has migration been represented in and shaped by literature and art? This course reviews exemplary texts, striking images, and important films. Focus is on the United States from around 1880 to World War II and on Europe in the second half of the twentieth century, then opening up toward students’ examination of cultural work by and about contemporary migrants from around the world. Readings include autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and creative visual work. Among the topics for discussion are metaphors and theories of migration (from uprooting and bird-of-passage to expatriate and melting-pot); labor arrangements; scenes of departure, voyage, and arrival; vibrant migrant communities and migrant alienation and pain; negotiation between places of origin and of arrival.

COREP-AD 50 Slavery and Freedom This course draws upon literature, folk tales, films, and paintings to connect and compare the ways in which slavery has been imagined, experienced, narrated, and contested in different parts of the world from antiquity to the present. We will start by charting cross-cultural debates over “slave” and “citizen” through the ages, before proceeding to explore texts and images that positioned the “slave” as subject, and used literacy as a mode of resistance. How did these narratives define “freedom” and shape international abolitionist publics? How might we read them for evidence of slave culture and community, and imaginaries of race, gender, and nation?  How do novels and films serve as sites of public memory --or amnesia -- about slavery? What do they tell us about the threshold between history and literature? How does historical context serve to explain fiction? How do novelists and artists both use and challenge the archives to imagine “agency” in ways that official history writing does not accommodate? Course materials may be drawn from the works of Aristotle, Manu, Kautilya, Bartolomé de las Casas, George Fitzhugh, Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Toni Morrison, Caryl Phillips, Amitav Ghosh, Rayda Jacob, and Abdurazak Gurnah, as well as the Uncle Remus Tales, and paintings and excerpts from the films Gone with the Wind, Amistad, Beloved, Twelve Years a Slave, Ceddo, Razia Sultan, Rue Cases Nègres, and Quilombo.

COREP-AD 51 Utopias & Dystopias We all think about wanting to live in the perfect world, but what happens when definitions of “perfect” conflict with one another?  In this Pathways of World Literature course, we will explore the ways that writers and artists have wrestled with the question of “utopia” and, more particularly, the ways in which utopias always seem to fall short of their ideal.  As we examine these failed utopias, we will consider the ways in which these texts explore the increasingly fraught relationship between humanity and technology, and between the community and the individual.  Drawing on written and cinematic texts from around the world, this course will consider whether any attempt at utopia is doomed, given the human proclivity for violence and xenophobia.  We will also consider why, in recent years, dystopian worlds have become the mainstay of pop culture, from novels to video games and movies. The course may include contemporary work by Hiyao Miyazaki, Chan Koonchung, and Vladimir Sorokin, as well as such classics as Thomas More’s Utopia, Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland, and Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis.” Summer 2015 Deborah Williams Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

Often the call for tolerance is grounded in relativism—the thought that there isn’t a fact of the matter. After all, on what basis could we insist that others share our beliefs if those beliefs are subjective, a function of upbringing or our peculiar tastes and concerns? But should we accept relativism? Can relativism justify tolerance? If not, then how can we justify tolerance?   This course is writing intensive.

CORES-AD 02 Wealth of Nations This course examines the determinants of economic development in the modern world. The course is divided into two parts. The first reviews theories that place factors of production such as labor and technology as the main cause of cross-country differences in economic wealth. The second part of the course investigates the role of institutions, culture, religion, geography, and luck as deeper causes of comparative development. The main questions addressed throughout the course are: Why are there such large differences in income per capita across countries? Why have some countries developed steadily over the past 200 years while many others have not? Why do some governments adopt policies that promote economic development while others set up barriers to economic activity? These questions are analyzed from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

CORES-AD 04W Prejudice This course covers historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.

CORES-AD 05a Relationship of Government and Religion This course examines the relationship between government and religion. To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: "Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.

We examine how animals are socially or culturally constructed in “traditional” and “modern” societies, and consider proposals for studying animals as minded social actors. Readings include religious, scientific, philosophical, and political texts from Arabic/Islamic, Chinese, and Judeo-Christian literatures.   This course is writing intensive.

The human sciences, born of the Enlightenment’s quest to recreate Man in its image, gave rise to a paradox. In brokering reconfigurations of the essence and boundaries of the human, new models for socio-political organization, and claims to inalienable human rights, they also demarcated and fortified the supposedly ‘natural’ fault lines between sexes, races, cultures, and peoples. The course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the nature of cultural distinction and the historical development of the Image of Man in a variety of global case studies, from the eighteenth century to the present.

CORES-AD 12 Love, God, and Politics The course grapples with love, a blind spot in social theory, and its relation with religion, transcendence, sacrifice, and faith. On the one hand, sexuality and gender have become objects of intense concern, politicized by religious movements around the world from the fundamentalist Christians in America to Islamists and pietists in the Islamic world. On the other hand, for large numbers of young people in the Western world not only has sexuality become increasingly unhinged from love, but love has become a troubling category, something uncertain and dangerous to believe in. This course examines the relation between love, sex, and religion as they reverberate in both the private and public spheres.

CORES-AD 13 Family, Gender, and Modernity This class examines a few universal, global patterns in the history of families and the many ways that families are culturally diverse. We begin with a historical survey, from the "traditional" families that once dominated throughout the world, to the "modern" (industrial) and "post-modern" (post-industrial) family values that appear today. Then we focus on particular aspects of family life: childhood; dating and courtship; sex and reproduction; husband-wife relations; old age; female-headed and other non-traditional families.  Students in the NYUNY Sociology Dept: This course counts for Sociology elective credit Fall 1 2011; 7 Weeks Linda Gordon - MR, 1:10-3:50 Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

CORES-AD 14 Self-Representation There are many different ways in which human beings represent themselves. I represent myself as a living being, as belonging to a given society and culture, as having a given character, and so on. But do I have a representation of myself as the author of those representations? Exploring this question casts light on central questions of philosophy, for instance the relation between mind and body, the relation between self and other, or the belief that we have freedom of the will. Readings may include selections from Western philosophy and Buddhist philosophy as well as neuroscience, psychology, psychoanalysis, and literary works.

CORES-AD 15W Politics and the City Cities are probably the most efficient social networks. They allow for increased communication and innovation. They are natural spaces for deliberation and collective action.

CORES-AD 16 Family and Kinship Being part of a family and of being related, or kin, to other human beings is a universal human experience; it is fundamental to our sense of ourselves. Yet what we mean by family or by kinship changes dramatically across societies and through time. This course introduces social scientific approaches to and methods for understanding and analyzing this diversity; it therefore asks students to explore the relationship between the universal and what is specific to particular societies and cultures.   Fall 2011; 14 Weeks Marzia Balzani - MR, 11:30-12:45 Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

From credit derivatives to pyramid schemes, home mortgages to credit cards, finance both underwrites the aspirations and lines the underbelly of the contemporary economy. Finance also shapes the urban environment, producing new city forms and social structures. Drawing on sociology, anthropology, fiction, and film, our seminar examines finance as a mode of social relations and cultural meaning in contemporary capitalism.  This course appears in...

How does gender intersect with other axes of identity such as class, nation, and ethnicity in a globalized world? The course introduces students to select women’s issues (e.g. employment, political participation, reproductive rights and healthcare, feminism vs. multiculturalism, gender based violence, and peace building) that have emerged in the global context and the international debates that surround them. In addition, the course looks at the relevance of women’s representation to address barriers to gender equality in the ‘democratic process’ as well as the shortcomings of democratic mechanisms to achieve women’s rights and some proposed solutions to these limitations.

CORES-AD 22W Cultures and Modernities “Culture,” wrote Raymond Williams, “is one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language.” Modernity, arguably, is another. Moreover, “culture” and “modernity” are often held to be at odds with one another; if modernity can be defined by its claim to universal applicability, then culture(s) mark the disjunctures and discrepancies that repeatedly disrupt this narrative. This course examines the (cross-) cultural politics and imaginaries of “modernity” to ask: What does it mean to be modern in the global present? This course is writing intensive.

CORES-AD 23 Financial Systems as Social Forms Financial systems direct flows of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. This course compares the theories implicit in the U.S. and UAE financial systems and describes how they work in practice. Whereas credit and interest are central to U.S. banking, Shari’ah law forbids interest, so Islamic banking uses profit- and loss-sharing to organize investment. By comparing these two systems, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in a global context.

CORES-AD 24W Landscapes of Memory This course explores the ways in which urban landscapes have traditionally served as fragile repositories for collective memory from the first monuments of Near Eastern civilizations to the modern architecture of contemporary global cities. Some cities seek to preserve their pasts, while others aggressively brush aside older forms and structures to make way for the new. Students examine the “politics” of urban memory, exploring historical and contemporary debates about the conflicting demands of preservation and modernization in a variety of cities from around the world.

A gift can be a material object or money, but it can also be an act of kindness or love. A gift is free but it can also come with the expectation that it will be matched by a return gift. Gift giving is therefore part of a complex structure of economic and social exchange. This course considers gift giving from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and the arts; it explores gift exchange through ethnographies as well as texts on market economies and art, gender, death, altruism, risk, and the impacts of colonialism on traditional exchange societies. Readings will include seminal works on gift exchange by Marcel Mauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, Franz Boas, and others.

CORES-AD 26 Legitimacy What are the foundations of political legitimacy and to what extent do governments abide by them? In this course, we will explore these questions using both classical and contemporary accounts. The first half of the course focuses on political systems in Ancient Greece, Rome, Medieval Europe, and Early Modern Europe through the lens of great thinkers, including Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Burke, Weber, and Marx, as well as a series of primary source documents. We then proceed to the “post-1789” world and discuss legitimacy in the context of democratic government. Topics covered include the role of legislators, issue representation, descriptive vs. substantive governance, and the ongoing debate between advocates of majoritarianism and those of proportionalism.  Fall 2012; 14 Weeks Adam Ramey - MW, 1:10-2:25 Taught in Abu Dhabi Fall 2013; 14 Weeks Adam Ramey - MW, 2:35-3:50 Taught in Abu Dhabi Fall 2014; 14 Weeks Adam Ramey - TR, 3:35-4:50 pm Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a “just war,” as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

CORES-AD 29W Property The institution of property describes one of the fundamental relationships between people: the relationship between people as it pertains to things. In this seminar, we explore how understandings of property have been influenced by cultural and ethical norms in different civilizations; how property rights have evolved with technological progress and changes in the demands of the environment; how property is affected by and influences the sphere of individual freedom, the relation between the individual and the state, and the organization of productive activity.  As examples, we will look at property in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome; consider the views on property expressed in Christianity and Islam as well as the role that changing views on property played in the Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution. We will use our insights to debate contemporary issues in property rights of interest to seminar participants. These might include intellectual property rights, rights to genetic material, inheritance, airwaves, financial regulation, the rights of indigenous tribes of the Amazon rainforest, claims on the Arctic, or the trade-off between rights to privacy and freedom of the press.   This course is writing intensive.

Still others argue that political authority is never legitimate.  We shall explore the classical views of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and the anarchist tradition embodied by Robert Paul Wolfe, and read in both western and non-western traditions, secular and the non-secular traditions.   Fall 2 2012; 7 Weeks Jules Coleman - UMW, 4:00-5:40 Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 1 2014; 7 Weeks Jules Coleman - TR, 10:00-12:30 pm (Sem 1) Taught in Abu Dhabi Spring 2014; 14 Weeks Jules Coleman - TR, 1:10-3:50 pm (Sem 2) Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

CORES-AD 34J Polarization Polarization has been a feature of societies around the world since the inception of human civilization. To this day, individuals routinely sort themselves in to groups based on share political, social, religious, or cultural beliefs. In turn, these sorted groups often find themselves at polar extremes from one another, something that has often led to intense, and sometimes violent, conflict. In this course, we will explore the history, emergence, and pervasiveness of various kinds of polarization: ethnic, linguistic, religious, political, and geographic. We will begin the course by defining polarization and looking at examples of it from antiquity to the present. Thereafter, we will look at the consequences of polarization for politics, social interactions, and economics. The course will be taught using classical works by kings and statesmen (e.g., Constantine of Rome, Louis XIV of France, Woodrow Wilson), as well as contemporary scholarship from a diverse group of scholars: historians, demographers, political scientists, biologists, and economists. Special attention will be given to social media and social networking, a pervasive aspect of contemporary social polarization; it will serve as the basis for a course-long project.

CORES-AD 35 Hard Choices Life is rife with hard choices. Should you become a doctor or a lawyer? How much should you sacrifice in order to help others? Should you marry and have children? This course examines the phenomenon of hard choices by focusing on two questions: (1) what makes a choice hard? and (2) what should/does one do when faced with a hard choice? We explore answers to these questions from a variety of perspectives – philosophical, religious, literary, psychological, and neuroscientific.

CORES-AD 36W Ideas of the Sacred The question of God(s) pertains to the existence, manifestations, meaning, and attributes of the sacred.  Although conceptions about the sacred are inevitably shaped by history and culture, the fundamental question of God(s) has had an enduring presence throughout human experience.  This course takes up this perennial human question from the context of some of the world’s major religious traditions including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism.  What similarities do these great traditions share, and how does their understanding of the sacred differ?  Additionally, the course explores the relation between reason and faith.  How does the empirical verification characteristic of an increasingly pervasive scientific and technological worldview impact on belief in God(s)?  Readings for the course are drawn from a variety of disciplines with a focus on primary sources and seminal works. This course is writing intensive.

CORES-AD 37W Slavery and Freedom in Comparative Perspective This course examines slavery in historical and comparative perspective by focusing on Greek and Roman slavery, African and Islamic slavery, and slavery in the American South, Brazil, and the Caribbean.  We will examine the nature and centrality of the institution of slavery, the difference between societies in which slavery existed and those which can be thought of as “slave societies, “ asking such questions as how did enslavement occur and who were the people enslaved and in what ways were did they differ from non-slaves? What “rights” or standing in the law if any did slaves possess? What was the nature and extent of the master’s power over their slaves? What were the social, economic and political functions of slavery? These are important questions for understanding slavery.  But the study of slavery inevitably involves broader, more fundamental issues concerning freedom, personhood, social inclusion and belonging.  As Orlando Patterson put it in the most far-reaching study of slavery, Slavery and Social Death,  “the idea of freedom and the concept of property were both intimately bound up with the rise of slavery, their very antithesis.  Once we understand the dynamics of slavery, we immediately realize why there is nothing in the least anomalous about the fact that an Aristotle or a Jefferson owned slaves."

CORES-AD 39W Revolutions and Social Change Revolutions, i.e. the rapid, massive and often violent change in the political and economic arrangements of society, mark the modern epoch starting with England in the 1640s, America in 1776, and France in 1789.  Revolutions obviously continue today. But what are revolution’s causes, typical course and consequences? Why such passion and energy? A systematic comparison of different revolutions informed by both the classical and contemporary theories of revolution might offer a few startling insights. This course is writing intensive.

CORES-AD 40 Corruption Political corruption exists everywhere, but which countries are most corrupt? Do highly corrupt countries have common characteristics? How much corruption is there? The social costs of political corruption, from stealing public funds to paying bribes to avoid basic safety and healthy regulations, are often extremely high. Why are most attempts to fight corruption unsuccessful? The course is comparative and historical, and as far as possible requires no background knowledge.

CORES-AD 42 Economics of Everyday Life There is the economics of economists, highfalutin and opaque theoretical models, and then there is economic activity as we experience it in our everyday lives and settings. Between the two stands a wall of incomprehension. From work to love, from social networks to family life, consumption, money, witchcraft, slavery, digital economies, slums, and ghettos, these spheres of everyday life ask us hard questions about the nature of the economic realities we inhabit. This course will seek to explore the everyday life of economic experience in a way that can capture its richness, diversity, and complexity. To that end, we will be drawing on a range of sources, from classical philosophy, to journalism, sociology, anthropology, manga, film, history, literature and even economics in search of a few answers.

How do a series of sometimes disparate beliefs about issues come together to form an ideology? How do ideologies change and reform over time? In this course, we explore these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. We begin by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, we read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Robespierre, Burke, Jefferson, Marx, Lenin, Mosca, and (Benedict) Anderson.  Thereafter, we look at how to measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter). In the last part of the course, we examine how shifting ideologies beliefs have (or might have) consequences for a wide range of human phenomena, ranging from interpersonal interactions to elections and international conflict.

CORES-AD 44 Consumption and Material Culture What are the social, political, and economic forces that bring consumer goods into being, keep them there, and then cause them to disappear from household use and enter the world’s waste stream? Searching for what anthropologist Mary Douglas called “an anthropology of consumption,” we will look across history and places, to pre-modern Japan, Renaissance England, the contemporary UAE and North America.  We ask about the politics of things and their shifting roles in everyday life. What is the nature of taste? of shopping? How do shifts occur depending on object, place, and time? We will explore the logistics of fashion, the link between goods and geography, production systems, and distribution through retail markets.  We stretch theoretically across the political economy of Marx, neo-classical economics, and the more recent cultural-social schemas of Bruno Latour and Howard Becker. For a final project students will focus on a specific object that they research and present to class, based on readings, discussions and original research.

CORES-AD 45 Language and Thought The course is about the nature of language, of thought, and of the relation between them.  Among the questions to be asked are: Are there such things as meanings, and if so, what sorts of things are they?  How do the meanings of linguistic expressions depend on the speech acts the expressions are used to perform?  Is linguistic representation to be explained in terms of mental representation?  Vice versa?  Or is neither to be explained in terms of the other?  How from a finite stock of words is it possible for a language to construct an infinite number of sentences, each with its own meaning?  How is it possible for a child to acquire—in just a few years and without any instruction—the ability to understand indefinitely many sentences never previously encountered by herself or anyone else?  In grappling with these and other questions we will study work in philosophy, theoretical linguistics and cognitive psychology.

The size, composition, and distribution of a population may change over time. This course sets out to understand the causes and consequences of population change across the globe, and engage the students in ongoing debates over population policies. Population change takes shape by births, deaths, and migration. These fundamental population processes are influenced by institutions of marriage, education, health care, and the economy. Population change may lead to different cultural phenomena and individual behaviors and varying levels of economic development. It may also have implications for the distribution of human welfare, which may in turn elicit perception of injustice and even political action. We will engage the interdisciplinary scholarship on global population, and contemplate issues faced by different countries. We will emphasize general principles that help us understand global population change, and try to come up with policy solutions to related issues.

CORES-AD 48 Subjectivity Human beings differ from machines, and perhaps also from other animals, in the way we encounter the world—always from a first-personal perspective, an awareness of oneself in the world and not merely of the world. But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, by finding some particular function of the brain? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called “the human condition”? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any single other topic, have had something important to say. We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek and Jaina intellectual cultures, and look critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovskiy; and at dissenters from Vasubandhu to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion—or, worse, a deceit.   Fall 2014; 14 Weeks Jonardon Ganeri - TR, 10:40-11:55 am Taught in Abu Dhabi This course appears in...

CORES-AD 49 The Great Divergence In 1500 the economic, social, and political differences between Europe and Asia were small.  By the twentieth century, the gaps were enormous.  How can we explain this Great Divergence between Europe and Asia?  The course will discuss the classical answers to this question given by Weber, Smith, Marx, and Malthus.  Has modern research confirmed or contradicted their views?  The roles of demography, politics, law, globalization, social structure, science, and technology will be discussed as well as the interconnections between them.  The course aims to expose the methods that social scientists and historians use to answer grand questions of social evolution, so that the approaches can be compared, contrasted, and assessed.

CORES-AD 50W Emotions Emotions have been understood since Antiquity to stand at the heart of human motivation and agency, as well as to influence diverse facets of the human condition, from family formation, empathy, and socialization, to choice-making, aggression, and war. Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical, and social-engineering projects, and the collusion of emotional and political regimes, it further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants, beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. Course readings include works by Homer, Aristotle, Dharmakīrti, Ibn Sina, Abelard and Heloise, Shigesuke, Descartes, Spinoza, Campe, Darwin, and Freud, as well as relevant secondary scholarship.

CORES-AD 51 Shame and Guilt We will read and discuss works of major writers to explore the role that the moral emotions, shame and guilt, have played and still play, in our individual and collective lives.  We will ask whether these two emotive forces are parallel or antagonistic in their effects on our behavior.  We will apply the concepts of shame and guilt to the understanding of psychology and moral value systems, and of different patterns of culture and politics.  We will attempt to understand how shame and guilt can both serve adaptive (life-supporting) as well as maladaptive (life-destroying) functions.  Finally, we will ask whether developing the capacity to love can enable us to transcend the destructive outcomes that both shame and guilt, and the ethical systems they motivate, can generate.  Authors studied will include Homer, Sophocles, the Bible, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Freud, Ruth Benedict, Pierre Bourdieu, Salman Rushdie and Kanan Makiya.

Course description: Most English-speaking people can answer the question, “What is your religion?” … even if the answer is “I am an atheist, so I don’t have one.” Yet the things we call religions are remarkably diverse. They differ, for example, in whether they address one God, no gods or many; how important they think explicit creeds are; how much attention they give to prayer, fasting and other rituals; and whether adherents are expected to dress or eat or engage in other everyday practices in a distinctive way. In this course we’ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science—E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim. Among our questions will be, “Is religion a European concept?” *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

CORES-AD 54J Surveillance and Privacy This multidisciplinary course examines the historical, sociological, cultural, and political significance of surveillance, with a particular focus on the relationship between surveillance and privacy. Drawing on a wide range of sources (­including academic research, historical documents, literature, film, and social media), the course explores how developments in the practice and technologies of surveillance have shaped the ways in which we think about privacy, identity, and personal information over the last 3000 years. Among the central questions that animate the course are: What is the relationship between surveillance and governance?  How has the emergence of various forms of electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about identity and individual privacy? How do we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security in a world characterized by increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of state and private surveillance? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, paying particular attention to the ways in which certain major events (such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States) have shaped how we think about surveillance and its relationship to privacy, security, and democracy. *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana's economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.
