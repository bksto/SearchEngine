One of the new regulations focuses on the need for institutions offering distance education to acquire authorization from any state where the institution has currently enrolled students. As the details regarding this regulation continue to be clarified, San Bernardino Valley College (SBVC) is investigating the processes involved in gaining authorization from other states. Depending on the outcome of this investigation, SBVC could notify students residing in a particular state that they are not eligible to register for distance education courses. In cases where SBVC students are affected by this change, San Bernardino Valley College will provide assistance to students to resolve this matter. Complaint Resolution The ultimate rationale for Out-of-State Authorization is the protection for students enrolling in out-of-state institutions who become victims of "predatory practices" regarding tuition, student loans, and financial aid. Although SBVC is not guilty of such "predatory practices,"  SBVC is required to provide current and prospective students with contact information for filing complaints. For complaints regarding grades follow the San Bernardino Valley College policies found on pages 27 and 30 of the SBVC catalog.  For other complaints follow the "Student Grievance and Due Process" section of the SBVC catalog. If an issue cannot be resolved internally, you may file a complaint with your state. WCET provides links to the phone numbers, e-mail, and/or links to state educational agencies.  And here is a direct link to a list of the offices in each state where complaints may be addressed. San Bernardino Valley College is accredited by the Accrediating Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) under the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The ACCJC site provides complaint procedures against the accrediting commission or its accredited institutions.  For questions concerning the complaint process or the new U.S. DOE regulations affecting distance education, please contact the Office of the Vice President of Instruction at SBVC.
