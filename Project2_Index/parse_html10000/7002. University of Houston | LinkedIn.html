University of Houston The University of Houston’s success is essential to the city and the nation, and we have a bold vision for our future. Welcome to the Powerhouse. See the UH 2014 President's Report here: http://www.uh.edu/presidents-report/2014/ 2014 President's Reportuh.edu Looking back at the University of Houston's accomplishments of the last year and looking ahead to its aspirations for the future.

I disagree with you and the idea that, “it's success is essential to the Nation is a bit of a reach.” Here’s why: Upon meeting me, the chair of the department of the M.S. program at Temple University wanted to discuss the amazing research UH (Dr. Heath) has done and is working on now. So, yes – UH’s success is essential to the nation considering how much of their research exists in praxis and dominates how I, and all communication professionals, conduct day-to-day operations and create strategic plans for business development. 10 days ago Christina Ferraz Further, the “recent embellishments” made in media cannot be correlated to what you may consider embellishment in regards to school rankings/progress reported in the President’s Report. Brian Williams lied about his plane being shot down during war correspondence whereas UH rankings can be quantified. The two aren't even remotely comparable. 10 days ago Add a comment...
