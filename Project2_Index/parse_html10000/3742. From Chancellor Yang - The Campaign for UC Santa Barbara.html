Yang Chancellor Greetings! On behalf of our campus community, I am honored and pleased to thank you for your generosity and participation in The Campaign for UC Santa Barbara. Our enthusiasm and momentum continue to grow, and we have now reached the $973-million mark on a steady march toward our billion-dollar goal. We are particularly inspired by and grateful for the leadership of our Campaign co-chairs, Jeff Henley '66 and Lady Leslie Ridley-Tree H'12; our honorary Campaign chair, Michael Douglas '68; our many regional committee members; and our Trustees, faculty, alumni, parents, friends, and volunteers, as well as the hard work of our Development team, our administrative and faculty colleagues, and our staff and student volunteers. Your visionary guidance and generous support are key factors in helping UC Santa Barbara maintain and enhance our stature as a preeminent global university with the highest reputation in research, teaching, and service at the frontiers of every area in which we excel. Your involvement also signals an unwavering belief in what is and will always be our university's greatest resources: faculty, students, and staff. Our top-notch faculty not only work tirelessly in research, teaching, and service, but also help bring in substantial research funds, raise private funds, and even donate their own personal money. Our staff members have devoted – some for generations! – their indispensable proud and hard work to afford us a living and learning environment that is the envy of the world. We are proud that our students are generous philanthropic leaders as well, involved in many charities, giving of their time and energy, and serving as ambassadors for our campus. By focusing on the importance of giving back, our students are helping to cultivate a "culture of giving" among their peers and future generations of UCSB alumni. We are excited about our future, and encouraged by your vision and generosity as we work together to continue our dash to the finish line of our Campaign and beyond. Our legacy is the promise of the highest standards of excellence, opportunity, and innovation, as well as our rich resources of diversity. The Campaign for UC Santa Barbara ensures that during our time and for all generations ... The Promise Continues. Henry T.
