We are especially proud to be one of “America’s Best Colleges” in the 2012 U.S. News & World Report. The Division of Academic Affairs, led by the Office of the Provost, spearheads the academic mission of the university. All of the academic disciplines embrace the teaching of theory through application. A biology student might use digital image analysis to monitor the virus multiplication. An urban and regional planning student might use GIS (geographic information systems) to chart the shrinking of low-income housing in an urban area. This focus on actions and solutions turns our students into skilled workers, integrative problem solvers, creative researchers, and well-balanced leaders.
