Whether or not you believe your coursework will be transferable, you will be required to report ALL college and university coursework undertaken in your application. No final decisions on transfer credit will be made until you officially apply and enroll at UCSB. You may also be required to demonstrate English language proficiency. Minimum Transfer Eligibility Requirements Foreign Academic Records When you apply, you must report ALL foreign coursework as it would appear on your foreign academic records. You are required to report your junior/community college or diploma program courses along with all other post-secondary coursework and grades received in your application. However, UCSB generally does not transfer credit from junior/community college programs that are technical or vocational in nature, or that do not lead on to further academic study at a university. Meeting English Composition Coursework Requirements One of the admission requirements for all transfer students is two transferable courses in English composition with grades of "C" or better. If you are applying to transfer directly from a foreign college or university where English is not the language of instruction, you are strongly encouraged to take as much English as your curriculum will allow. It is very unlikely that any of your English courses will transfer to UCSB, but your English preparation will make your application more competitive. You will need to demonstrate your English proficiency with one of the approved examinations. Determining Course Transferability Check to see if your school is recognized by your country’s Ministry of Education (or the appropriate government agency) or a U.S. accrediting agency. The school must be well recognized in order for UCSB to accept any credit. You must also be enrolled in a university level academic degree program comparable to a U.S. associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Terminal vocational or technical programs are often not transferable to UCSB, even if taken at recognized institutions. Determine if your subjects are similar to any subjects offered at UCSB. We will only consider transfer credit for subjects that are similar to those offered in the UC system. If you cannot find a comparable course at UCSB, then look in that catalogs of the other UC campuses. A course may also be transferable if it is offered somewhere in the UC system. Remedial academic subjects, such as English taught as a second language and high school level math, are not transferable. Whether or not you believe your coursework will be transferable, you will be required to report all college and university coursework undertaken in your application. No final decisions on transfer credit will be made until you officially apply and enroll at UCSB.
