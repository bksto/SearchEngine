UC Riverside maintains an active patenting and patent licensing program through Research and Economic Development’s Technology Commercialization program, ensuring that the results of our research are made available for the public’s use and benefit. UCR has had many remarkable research success . Our inventions have run the gamut from research in plant varieties, plant genomics, biomedical sciences, materials science and engineering. The UC system has used patents and licensing for more than 40 years to promote the development of research while also preventing that emerging research from straying outside the inventor’s control. The Process of Transitioning to Market Transitioning a product or technology from the lab to the marketplace involves several steps, all of which are designed to protect the rights of the person or persons whose breakthroughs will be in great demand. These steps include: Publication – Proper publication and disclosure of an invention is crucial to ensuring patent rights to the invention, both domestically and abroad. Reporting – University policy calls for disclosure of all inventions for which a patent could conceivably be necessary. Evaluations – The university will help an inventor determine whether an invention is likely patentable, what its commercial potential may be and how much it likely will cost to protect the invention with patents in the U.S. and abroad. Patent applications – The University Licensing Office coordinates the process of seeking a patent. The inventor works closely with a patent attorney to complete the process and answer questions from a U.S. patent examiner. The process can take two years, but it is the safest way to protect an invention for the benefit of the inventor and the university.
