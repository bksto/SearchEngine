Prospective Students University of Redlands > Prospective Students > High School Students & Guidance Counselors > How To Apply How To Apply Who Should Apply as a Freshman? Freshmen applicants are those who will enter Redlands with fewer than 24 transferrable college semester credits. If you’re a high school senior, this is probably you! When Should I Apply? The University of Redlands offers fall admission in two phases: Early Action (Nov. 15) and Regular Decision (Jan. 15). Applications submitted beyond these deadlines will be considered on a space available basis.  However, there are other deadlines for freshmen applicants, mostly relating to scholarships and financial aid. How Do I Apply? Step 1: Submit the SAT I or ACT We require either the SAT I or the ACT. You may take both tests as many times as you’d like, and are encouraged to send us all scores from all your sittings, as Redlands will mix-and-match scores. You should arrange to have your scores sent to the Office of Admissions. Our Standardized Test school code is 4848 for the SAT and 0464 for the ACT. We do not require SAT II subject tests. For more information, please see our standardized test policies. Step 2: Complete the Application You may apply online using the Common Application. As part of the application, submit the $30 application fee. Step 3: Submit the “Secondary School Report” Form The Secondary School Report Form (also called the Counselor Recommendation) should be filled out by an administrative official (director of guidance, counselor, principal, vice principal or dean) and sent directly to the Office of Admissions. Some high schools are now submitting the School Report Form online through the Common Application system. Please consult with your counselor to see if this is an option for you. Step 4: Submit a Teacher Evaluation The Teacher Evaluation form should be completed by an academic instructor, and sent to the Office of Admissions. Academic subjects include math, science, English, history, foreign language, humanities and social sciences. Please note that recommendations from coaches, club advisors, music directors, AVID instructors, or other extra-curricular advisors are generally not accepted as a primary recommendation. You are welcome, however, to submit them as secondary recommendations. Some high schools are now submitting the Teacher Evaluation online through the Common Application system. Please consult with your counselor to see if this is an option for you. Step 5: Submit Your Official High School Transcript An official, endorsed transcript of your high school work must be sent directly from your school to the university. Transcripts that are mailed or hand-delivered by the student are not considered official. Transcripts should be mailed to our admissions office or submitted by a school official via Common Application. Step 6: Submit Official College or University Transcripts If you have participated in any for-credit courses at a community college or university you will need to submit an official, endorsed copy of the transcript to the admissions office. This includes courses taken concurrently while in high school or during the summer. Please note that students who have graduated from high school, but do not have 24 transferrable semester units, will be reviewed as a freshman applicant. The transcript must be sent directly from the college or university to our office. Transcripts that are mailed or hand-delivered by the student are not considered official. Transcripts should be mailed directly to our admissions office. Step 7: Submit Additional Forms, As Needed Some students, including those students planning to participate in specialty programs within the university, must submit additional applications or forms. These include: School of Music Johnston Center for Integrative Studies Homeschooled Students Step 8: Schedule a Visit We welcome visits - in fact, we think your campus visit will tell you a lot more than we can in print or on the Web. Consider visiting during your spring break or when your schedule allows, and note that if you're applying to the School of Music, you should audition on one of the Audition Saturdays. More about scheduling... Step 9: Explore Financial Aid If you're applying for need-based financial aid, we encourage you to complete and submit your admission application to Redlands by January 15. You can begin the actual financial aid process Jan. 1 - which is the earliest you may submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA should be submitted by March 2 to the Department of Education. Our U.S. Department of Education Institutional Code is 001322. California residents should also complete the Cal Grant GPA verification form by March 2. This form is available at your current school. You may also request the form from the Office of Financial Aid or the California Student Aid Commission.   Take Action Apply Online Download Application Forms View information about Financial Aid » Site Navigation About Redlands Admissions & Aid Academics Centers of Distinction Innovation & Research Student Life Athletics Support Redlands In This Section: High School Students & Guidance Counselors Why Redlands Before You Apply Helpful Resources Download Forms Redlands In Your Area How To Apply Requirements & Deadlines Re-Applicants Johnston Center Applicants School of Music Applicants Home-Schooled Applicants Once You've Applied Information for Guidance Counselors Información de admisiones en español Meet Us Take a Virtual Tour Visiting the Redlands Campus Information For: Prospective Students Current Students Parents & Families Faculty & Staff Alumni & Friends Journalists News Calendars Bulldog Cam Library Offices & Directories Contact Redlands University of Redlands Office of Admissions P.O.
