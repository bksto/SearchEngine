Hosted by: Zephyr Frank "I chose this book because it has a great deal of meaning to me personally-- it was the first really great work of modern Latin American literature that I read as a student. I have used it in courses here at Stanford and each time I go back to teaching it I feel like I learn something new and gain new perspective on Mexican history and literature-- its just an inexhaustible source of interest."
