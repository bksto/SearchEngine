The group’s founders are twin musicians, Michael and John Fatum, who started performing together at the age of four from behind the piano. Raised in Chicago, they fell in love with Gospel music from the South Side of the city as well as the story-telling festival community. Eventually they found the trumpet and drums respectively, and fell in love with jazz music. At 18 they began the Fatum Brothers’ Jazz Orchestra (Now the Fatum Crittenden Jazz Orchestra) which recorded two albums and did two extensive U.S. tours before the boys graduated college.   Their group is comprised of young musicians, all recent graduates from top conservatory programs. They have already completed two cross-country tours, developed a “Jazz For Young People . . . By Young People” curriculum, and produced two records of all original music. Michael Fatum finished his degree at New York University and John Fatum at the Eastman School of Music. They have taken their leadership skills onto such projects as the Rad Trads. The group's concerts includes sold out performances at the Blue Note, Chicago Jazz Festival, and San Jose Jazz Festival.  Their recording “Live in Chicago” includes new compositions from the next generation of leading jazz composers and arrangers.  When in New York City, the boys lead their own small group projects of a trio and quintet. Members of the orchestra will give a free masterclass at 11 a.m. in the band room in the Fine Arts Center. For more information, one may contact Dr. Ken Carroll, professor of jazz studies. All seating is reserved.
