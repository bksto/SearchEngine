As Noted by the NAAB: In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-yearterm of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially,  constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. The University of Houston Gerald D. Hines College of Architecture Offers the Following NAAB-Accredited Degree Programs: Bachelor of Architecture (160 undergraduate credits) Master of Architecture Level I (non-pre-professional degree + 97 credits) Master of Architecture Level II (pre-professional degree + 60 graduate credits)  Next accreditation visit for all programs: 2022 Part II. 4.
