Schedule a Campus Visit. Campus Tours Student-led walking tours are one of the best ways to become better acquainted with our campus. Our student tour guides fill the tours with facts and personal stories, providing an overview of academic and student life at UMass Amherst. During the 90-minute tour, you'll see the Campus Center, Student Union, Du Bois Library, a model dorm room, Recreation Center, Commonwealth Honors College, and an academic building. Please be aware that these are general tours and not specific to any particular major. With a 1,400 acre campus and 90-plus majors, we can't show or tell you everything that UMass Amherst has to offer, but our tour guides can answer most questions and are available to give you directions or contact information for any department at the conclusion of the tour. Tours originate from the Robsham Memorial Center for Visitors. Please note that these walking tours cover about a mile, rain or shine - so be prepared for the New England weather! Admissions Information Sessions Prospective students who have not yet been offered admission to UMass Amherst are welcome to attend an Admissions information session prior to your tour. These sessions are conducted by an Admissions Representative, last about 45 minutes, and are specific to the freshman application process. They're a great way to learn more about the application and review processes.   Admitted Student Open Houses  If you are an admitted student and would like to attend an Admitted Student Open House, you are able to register through your SPIRE account.
