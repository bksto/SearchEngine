Academic Advising 2. Advanced Placement 3. Courses 4. Degrees 5. DegreeWorks 6. Diplomas 7. Enrollment 8. Enrollment Exceptions 9. General Education/Breadth 10. Grades 11. Other Institutions 12. Privacy 13. Transcripts 14. Verifications 15. Waitlists 16. Miscellaneous 1. Academic Advising A. I would like to speak with an academic advisor. Is this the right office for me to contact? No. The Registrar's Office does not provide academic advising. Each school has an Academic Advising Office with academic counselors to advise students in that school. This includes enrollment counseling. 2. Advanced Placement A. My AP scores are missing from my academic record. What should I do? AP scores are received by the Office of Admissions, who evaluates and posts them to your academic record (transcript). Contact the Office of Admissions regarding your AP scores. B. How do I correct discrepancies to the Advanced Placement (AP) scores on my academic record? AP scores are received by the Office of Admissions, who evaluates and posts them to your academic record (transcript). Contact the Office of Admissions regarding your AP scores. 3. Courses A. How may I get a course description of a particular course offered during the current academic year? Course Descriptions can be found in the UCI General Catalogue. B. How can I find classes in the Schedule of Classes? The easiest way to find classes in the Schedule of Classes is to search by Department Name. For example, if you are looking for a class in Anthropology, use the pull down menu to highlight Anthro. Click on Display Web Results. You can then view all the anthropology classes offered for the given quarter. C. Can I audit a class? No. Auditing of classes is not allowed. Irvine Academic Senate Regulation 340 states: "No student may enter upon any organized instructional activity until the student has registered and enrollment has been approved by the appropriate study list authority." Class attendance is limited to students who are pursuing a degree, have paid that quarter's tuition and fees and are enrolled in the course. Alternately, UC Irvine Extension has a program called Access UCI through which some UCI courses can be taken for a fee. D. The course I would like to enroll in has a restriction. What does this mean? A restriction on a course indicates that there are requirements that a student must meet in order to enroll in the course. Course restrictions are determined and placed by the department offering the course. When and if a restriction is removed, is also determined by the department offering the course. Therefore, courses may continue to be restricted throughout the Enrollment by Window and Open Enrollment periods. Questions regarding restriction codes placed on a course should be directed to the Schedule of Classes Coordinator of the department offering the course. Existing restrictions are identified in the Rstr column of the Schedule of Classes (SOC). Refer to our list of Course Restriction Codes for detailed descriptions of the various restriction codes. E. How do I find a course's prerequisites? Most course prerequisites can be found by using our Course Prerequisite Tool. If the course you are interested in has an "A" restriction in the Schedule of Classes (SOC), but no prerequisite link exists, contact the department offering the course. F. Why is the course I want to enroll in restricted to New Only? Departments place the New Only restriction to reserve seats for new students who will be enrolling in classes during their orientation sessions over the summer. Contact your academic advising office for enrollment counseling. 4. Degrees A. When will my degree post to my academic transcript? Degree information is available on transcripts: Fall: 8 weeks after instruction ends Winter: 6 weeks after instruction ends Spring: 6 weeks after instruction ends Summer: 6 weeks after Summer Session II instruction ends (for all Summer Session terms) You may order your transcripts at any time, and indicate that your transcripts are to be released only when your degree has posted to your academic record. Further information is available in the related question in our transcript FAQ. To verify the posting of your degree, view your transcript on StudentAccess. B. Who certifies my degree? Degree certification is the process of determining a student's eligibility to receive his or her degree. Undergraduate degrees are certified by the dean of the student's major. Graduate degrees are certified by the Dean of Graduate Division. The certification process will be completed seven to eight weeks after instruction ends. C. How can an employer verify my degree? Degree awarded and dates of attendance are public information. Therefore, an employer may obtain verification of your degree without your authorization. Written verification can be requested in person or by mail. Verbal verification can be obtained by telephone: (949) 824-6124. Further information is available on our Verifications webpage. 5. DegreeWorks A. I completed IGETC (Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum) prior to transferring to UC Irvine, but it is not checked off on my degree audit. How do I correct this? Contact the academic advising office in the school of your major. B. The transfer course work I completed outside of UC Irvine (e.g., community college) was sent to Admissions, but the courses are not visible on my degree audit. How do I correct this? Contact the academic advising office in the school of your major and ask them to contact the Registrar's office on your behalf to update to your transfer record. C. Transfer course work that should fulfill my degree requirements appears in the Electives section of my degree audit. How do I correct this? Contact the academic advising office in the school of your major to have these exceptions applied to your degree audit. The Registrar does not apply transfer course exceptions to your audit. Only your academic advising office can determine which courses fulfill degree requirements and can adjust your degree audit appropriately. D. Why is my degree audit not updated with the course(s) I completed to fulfill my General Education requirements? Contact the academic advising office in the school of your major for assistance. E. I fulfilled my language requirement at another institution or through a placement test. Why is my language requirement not marked as completed on my degree audit? Contact the academic advising office in the school of your major for assistance. F. I completed my University Requirements but they are not marked as completed on my degree audit. How do I correct this? Contact the academic advising office in the school of your major for assistance. G. The term just ended. When will my degree audit be updated with my grades? Your degree audit will be updated with your most recent grades by the Sunday evening following the Friday when grades are available on StudentAccess. H. I see my transfer work in StudentAccess but not in DegreeWorks. What should I do? Updates to your transfer course record may take up to 24 hours to be reflected in DegreeWorks. If 24 hours have passed and your transfer courses are still not displayed on your degree audit, contact the academic advising office in the school of your major. Ask them to update your degree audit. Some audits require a manual update which can be done by a counselor. I. I want to take a course next quarter, but am not sure if I will receive credit for it because the topic overlaps. What should I do? Contact the academic advising office in the school of your major for degree requirements, or consult the General Catalogue. J. My degree audit is not viewable. Instead, I received an error message. What should I do? Please contact the University Registrar Help Desk for assistance. 6. Diplomas A.When will my diploma be available? Degrees are noted on official transcripts approximately six weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are awarded (approximately eight weeks for fall quarter). Diplomas are typically available four months after the end of the quarter in which the student's degree is awarded. You will be notified by mail when your diploma is available. B. My minor is not noted on my diploma. Is this a mistake? Minors are not noted on diplomas; they are posted on your transcript. C. I have a double major. Will I receive two diplomas? Students with a double major within a single school will be awarded one degree and issued one diploma. The diploma will list both majors. Students with a double major within a single school with different degree types will be awarded two separate diplomas. An example of different degree types would be a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.). Students with a double major within two different schools will be awarded a degree from each school and will be issued a diploma from each school. D. Can I get a copy of my diploma? Only one diploma is issued per student. The Registrar's Office does not retain a copy of your diploma. If an employer or institution requests a copy of your diploma, we can issue an official transcript or verification that will state your degree awarded and award date. E. I lost my diploma, can I get a replacement? A replacement diploma may be requested if your original diploma has been lost or destroyed, or your name has changed since graduation. More information is available on our diplomas page. F. Can I have my diploma notarized? Yes. As a service to UCI students and alumni, the Registrar's Office offers a notary service for official university documents produced by or distributed by the University Registrar. Notarization requests may be made by mail or in person by appointment. Visit our Notary Service webpage for information about obtaining a notarization, fees, foreign use of notarized documents, and using your own notary. 7. Enrollment A. When can I view my enrollment window? Use WebReg or StudentAccess to view your enrollment window. Your enrollment window for the upcoming term is first viewable Monday of the 7th week of instruction of the current term. Specific dates for the Enrollment by Window period are always available on our Quarterly Academic Calendar. B. How was my window assigned? In general, enrollment windows are assigned by class level. Further information is available on our Enrollment Windows webpage. C. When can I use WebReg to enroll in courses? You may use WebReg to enroll in courses during the Enrollment by Window and Open Enrollment periods. The dates of these enrollment periods are always available on our Quarterly Academic Calendar. D. WebReg is no longer available. How do I modify my class schedule (add, drop, or change)? Beginning Monday of the 3rd week of instruction, enrollment modifications require an Enrollment Exception Request. There is no guarantee that your request will be granted. E. I am currently enrolled in 21 units but would like to waitlist additional classes. Can I increase my maximum allowable units? Your academic advising office can authorize you to enroll in more than 21 units. Contact them to discuss your situation. F. Why do the letters "mc" appear beside a class in my schedule? The "mc" signifies that there has been a change to the meeting time or meeting place of the class. When you list your classes and see the "mc" notation, the time and place that you see are the NEW time and place. G. Why is the course I want to enroll in restricted to New Only? Departments place the New Only restriction to reserve seats for new students who will be enrolling in classes during their orientation sessions over the summer. Contact your academic advising office for enrollment counseling. H. I'm a new freshman. How do I select and enroll in classes? The mandatory SPOP (Student Parent Orientation Program) includes academic advising and enrollment counseling. I. How do I enroll in classes if I am unable to attend any of the SPOP (Student Parent Orientation Program) sessions? Contact your academic advising office for enrollment counseling. J. I am transferring to UCI. Do I need to wait for orientation to enroll in classes? Contact the academic advising office of the school of your major for enrollment options. 8. Enrollment Exceptions A. When may I submit an Enrollment Exception request? You may submit an Enrollment Exception request beginning Monday of the 3rd week of instruction. The enrollment deadline for adds, drops, and changes is the end of the 2nd week of instruction. B. Can I request an Enrollment Exception to drop at 5:01 p.m. Friday of the 2nd week of instruction? No. You can request an Enrollment Exception beginning Monday of the 3rd week of instruction at 8:00 a.m. C. Where should I go to make an Enrollment Exception request? Log into StudentAccess and click on Applications in the navigation menu. From there, click on the Enrollment Exceptions tab. D. Who approves or denies my Enrollment Exception request? Depending on your request, your Enrollment Exception will require approvals from two or three of the following: 1. Instructor of record (or designee) 2. Dean of the department offering the Course (or designee) 3. Dean of your Major (or designee) Further information can be found on our Enrollment Exception approval process chart. E. How long will it take to process my Enrollment Exception request? The Enrollment Exception process requires multiple approvals and each required approval is typically reviewed within 2-3 business days. F. How will I be notified if my request has been approved or denied? You must return to the Applications section in StudentAccess to review the status of your Enrollment Exception request. Monitoring the status is the responsibility of the student. G. My Enrollment Exception request was denied, what can I do? First, make sure you have carefully read any messages sent to you and complied with any requests necessary to approve your Enrollment Exception request. If you have done so and your request was denied, you have the option to resubmit your Enrollment Exception request, but there is no guarantee that your subsequent request will be approved. H. Is there a fee for submitting an Enrollment Exception request? Beginning Monday of the third week on instruction, a single fee of $3 will be charged for all approved enrollment transactions that are submitted on the same day, and will be billed on ZOT Account Online. I. All I want to do is change discussions, but keep the same lecture. How can I do this? If you would like to only exchange the zero (0.0) unit components of your course (e.g., a zero unit discussion or zero unit lab), but remain enrolled in the component that has units (e.g., 4.0 unit lecture), use the switching option in the Enrollment Exception menu. This will permit you to exchange zero (0.0) unit components without having to drop the component that carries the units for the course. J. What is switching? Switching is the process of exchanging one zero-unit co-class that is linked to a unit bearing class for a different zero-unit co-class that is linked to the same unit bearing class. K. Can I switch in WebReg? No. Switches are requested via Enrollment Exceptions after the Enrollment by Window and Open Enrollment periods have passed. 9. General Education/Breadth A. Can you provide something in writing stating that I have completed my General Education/Breadth requirements? The Registrar's Office does not monitor nor evaluate General Education/Breadth requirements. Contact your academic advising office. 10. Grades A. Why did I receive a grade of NR for the class I took? NR stands for No Report. This likely means that your instructor has not submitted grades for the class. You can confirm the No Report status of your class by visiting the Late Grade link on our home page. B. What is needed to make the dean's honor list? Any undergraduate student is eligible for the dean's honor list if they are enrolled in at least 12 units for grades and that quarter's grade point average is 3.5 or higher. The required 12 units do not include courses repeated by the student in which the student has already received a passing grade. Since a failing grade (F) awards no units, a student repeating a previously failed course is eligible to count the repeated course toward dean's list criteria, provided that the student has not already exhausted the repeat rule as outlined in the Course Catalogue. 11. Other Institutions A. I'm taking courses at another institution. Can you tell me if my courses will fulfill my General Education/Breadth requirements at UCI? The Registrar's Office does not evaluate General Education/Breadth requirements. Contact your school's academic advising office. B. I took a class at another college. Where should I send my transcript? Transcripts from other institutions should be sent to the Office of Admissions. C. Another institution sent my transcript to UCI, when will the coursework be reflected on my UCI academic record? The Registrar's Office does not receive, evaluate, nor post credit from other institutions. This is handled by the Office of Admissions. D. I am applying to a school that requires semester hours on their application. How many quarter units equal a semester unit? Multiply quarter units by .667 to obtain semester units. 12. Privacy A. How do I remove my address and phone number from the UCI directory? Use StudentAccess to update the options to release and publish your student address and phone information. You can select "do not release to the public" and/or "do not publish in the campus directory" for your student address and phone data, and for your permanent address and phone data. The campus directory is updated nightly by OIT. Therefore, changes made through StudentAccess will be reflected the following day. B. My son/daughter is a UCI student. I would like to view his/her grades, class schedule, etc. How may I gain access to this information? When a student reaches the age of 18 or begins attending a post-secondary institution regardless of age, the privacy rights guaranteed by FERPA and the UC Privacy Policy are transferred to the student. Consequently, only non-restricted Directory Information (Public Information) may be released to a third party, including parents and legal guardians. To view anything other than Directory Information, you should request the information directly from your son/daughter. Both unofficial transcripts and class schedules are printable and available to the student, free of charge, at the Registrar's Office. Further information regarding FERPA and the UC Privacy Policy can be found on our Privacy Page. 13. Transcripts A. How do I order an official transcript? Official transcripts can be ordered online, in person, by mail, or via fax. Detailed information on ordering official transcripts is available on our page on Official Transcripts. B. What is the fastest way for me to obtain my transcript? 1. In person. Official transcripts are issued immediately upon request and payment. Payment may be made by cash or check during the Central Cashier's business hours. You must bring photo ID. To authorize another individual to pick up your transcript for you, refer to the related question in the transcript section of our FAQ. 2. Online. Transcripts may be ordered online using a major credit card or a check card (debit card with a Visa or MasterCard logo) when ordering online through the National Student Clearinghouse. Ordering online eliminates the need to send your request to the Registrar's Office by mail, thereby allowing the processing of your transcript order to begin sooner. Typically, transcripts are sent within two business days after processing begins. (Transcript processing does not occur during University holidays and recesses. Therefore transcripts ordered during Winter Recess will not be processed until the campus reopens in January.) C. May I authorize someone else to obtain my transcript for me? Yes. You may authorize another person to obtain your transcript for you. To do so, you must provide the person or the Registrar's Office with a signed letter authorizing him/her to obtain copies of your transcript. Your letter must include the following: • the specific name of the person you are authorizing • your name • your Student ID number (if known) • your birth date • last four digits of your Social Security Number (if you have one) • your signature Your authorized representative must provide a valid photo ID. Therefore, indicating "my mom" or "my friend" will not be sufficient. Your authorized representative must arrive during the Central Cashier's business hours, to pay any applicable fees for your transcript. The Central Cashier does not accept credit or debit cards for payment. You may pay for your transcript order online using a major credit card through the National Student Clearinghouse and have your authorized representative pick up your transcript in person once payment has been received by the Registrar's Office from the Clearinghouse. You may also fax your authorization letter directly to the Registrar's Office. Our fax number is: 949-824-7896. However, the fee payment for your transcript would still need to be received before your order can be processed. D. I am a current or former student. Can a third party (e.g., employer) order my academic transcript directly? Yes. You and the third party should refer to the procedures outlined on our page on Third Party Transcripts. E. I am a third party (e.g., an employer). How can I obtain an academic transcript for a current or former UCI student? You may obtain an academic transcript for a current or former UCI student by following the procedures outlined on our page on Third Party Transcripts. F. May I pay for my transcript with a credit or debit card? You may pay for your transcript with a credit card or a check card (debit card with a Visa or MasterCard logo) when ordering online through the National Student Clearinghouse. Transcript requests made in person or through the mail must be paid to the Central Cashier. The Central Cashier does not accept credit or debit cards for transcripts. However, payments may be made electronically to the Central Cashier via Western Union. G. I am a foreign resident and do not have a US bank account. How may I pay for my transcript? You may pay for your transcript online with a major credit card or check card (debit card with a Visa or MasterCard logo) when ordering online through the National Student Clearinghouse. Alternatively, the Central Cashier accepts Western Union payments and international money orders, made payable to: UC REGENTS. H. While ordering my transcript online, I was informed that there is a hold on my record. Will my transcript order be processed? No. If there is a hold on your record your order will be canceled. If you are a current student, sign in to WebReg or StudentAccess to view any holds on your student record, and then contact the office that placed the hold. Links to WebReg and StudentAccess are available on the University Registrar's website. If you are not a current student, contact the University Registrar who will direct you to the appropriate office to resolve the hold. The University Registrar is available from 8:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding university holidays). I. What is the difference between official and unofficial transcripts? The major difference between official and unofficial transcripts is the paper they are printed on. Official transcripts are printed on official transcript paper that contains the University Seal, the Registrar's signature, and a variety of security features to prevent the use of duplicate or fraudulent copies. Unofficial transcripts are printed on regular blank white paper and may be photocopied, should you require multiple unofficial copies. Unofficial Transcripts do not have UCI or University of California, Irvine printed on the transcript. Selecting which type of transcript to order should be determined based on what you need the transcript for. If an institution or employer requires an official sealed transcript, then you should obtain an official transcript. However, if an official transcript is not required, or if it is for your own personal use, a free unofficial transcript should be sufficient. Official transcripts reflect a cumulative gpa and total units completed at the end of the transcript. Unofficial transcripts will reflect this information as well, however they will also show a quarterly running total of units completed and gpa. J. What is the difference between an official transcript and a verification? An official transcript will show your entire UCI academic record. A verification will show specific information you select (e.g., enrollment status, good student discount status, loan deferment eligibility, degrees awarded). It is possible that a verification can provide your requestor all the necessary information without providing a complete record of your entire academic history. K. I'm ordering multiple official transcripts to be sent directly to me, will they all be individually sealed? Yes. If you order multiple official copies to be sent to you directly, each transcript will be individually sealed in an official transcript envelope. If you have both undergraduate and graduate records, each complete set will be individually sealed. Reasons why some students order multiple official transcripts sent to them directly: • so they may attach official transcripts themselves to their applications • in order to hand deliver their official transcripts • to keep official transcripts on hand for future use L. Will you reseal my official transcript envelope once I've opened it? No. Once your official transcript envelope has been opened, we will not reseal it, nor will we place it in a new envelope for you. You will always have the option of purchasing a new copy. If you want to see what is on your transcript without opening it, request a free unofficial copy. M. My official transcript requires an attachment. Is there an additional fee for this? No. There is no additional fee for attachments. Some institutions require forms to be attached to official transcripts for identification and processing purposes. We attach these forms to transcripts prior to sealing official transcript envelopes. We will not place letters, notes, Post-its, etc., inside official transcript envelopes. We will forward these, along with your transcript in a larger envelope that will contain your correspondence and sealed transcript. However, we recommend that you send any correspondence directly to the institution. N. May I email my transcript request? No. Transcript requests are accepted only: • Online through the National Student Clearinghouse • in person • by fax (when payment is made using Western Union) • by mail O. I have both undergraduate and graduate transcripts. Can I have only my graduate transcript sent? No. We will send your complete academic record. Your complete academic record consists of both undergraduate and graduate transcripts. P. Can you send an electronic version of my transcript? No. Transcripts are printed on paper and will be issued: in person, by mail, by express delivery, or by fax. They cannot be downloaded, emailed, scanned, or sent electronically. Q. Why doesn't my transcript show my work in progress (WIP) courses? UCI transcripts do not include work in progress for a current quarter. They only list courses and grades from completed terms in attendance. If you need documentation of your work in progress, you may order an enrollment verification, requesting that it list your current courses. R. I took courses through UCI Extension. How may I get transcripts for those courses? The Registrar's Office does not maintain records for course work taken through UCI Extension. If you need transcripts for courses taken through UCI Extension, please visit their website. S. Will the UCI Access courses I took be posted on my UCI transcript? UCI students will have the units and grade points of courses taken through Access UCI transferred to their record when they have been admitted or readmitted to regular student status. This applies only to UCI Access courses taken during the winter 2009 term or later. T. When should I order my transcript so that it will include my most recent grades? You may order your transcripts at any time. If your most recent grades have not yet posted to your academic record and you would like your transcript to include those grades, you must indicate this when ordering your transcript(s). If ordering online, select After Grades are Posted as the Processing Option in the Delivery Options section of the online order form. If ordering by mail or in person, check the appropriate boxes in the hold section on the Request for Official Transcripts. • Check the box that says Hold for the following • check the box that says Grades • Indicate the upcoming term from which you would like your grades posted before sending your transcript To view the date official transcripts are available, refer to the current Quarterly Academic Calendar in the section labeled Quarter Activity. Students with an active UCInetID may also verify the posting of their grades by viewing their transcript on StudentAccess. U. When should I order my transcript so that it will include my degree? You may order your transcripts at any time. If your degree(s) has not yet posted to your academic record and you would like your transcript to include your degree(s), you must indicate this when ordering your transcript(s). If ordering online, select After Degree is Awarded as the Processing Option in the Delivery Options section of the online order form. If ordering by mail or in person, check the appropriate boxes in the hold section on the Request for Official Transcripts. • Check the box that says Hold for the following • Check the box that says Degree • Indicate the upcoming term when your degree(s) will be awarded To view the date degrees post to transcripts, refer to the current Quarterly Academic Calendar in the section labeled Quarter Activity. Students with an active UCInetID may also verify the posting of their degree(s) by viewing their transcript on StudentAccess. V. When will my degree be posted to my transcript? To view the date degrees post to transcripts, refer to the current Quarterly Academic Calendar in the section labeled Quarter Activity. W. I recently graduated. How soon may I obtain official transcripts that will reflect my degree awarded? There is a seven week period after instruction ends before degree information is available on official transcripts. You may order your transcripts at any time, and indicate that your transcripts are to be released only when your degree has posted to your academic record. Further information is available in the related question in our transcript FAQ. To verify the posting of your degree, view your transcript on StudentAccess. X. My official transcript was never received. Can you resend it? Yes. We can resend your official transcript to the same recipient address free of charge if all of the following conditions apply: • You have verified with the recipient that your official transcript was not received. • At least thirty calendar days have passed since your official transcript was sent. • No more than ninety days have passed since your official transcript was sent. You always have the option to reorder your transcript. 14. Verifications A. What is the fastest way for me to obtain a verification? 1) The fastest way to obtain a verification is to come in person or authorize another person to pay and obtain a copy for you. In person, verifications are issued immediately upon request and payment, during the Central Cashier's business hours. The Central Cashier does not accept credit or debit cards. Bring photo ID. 2) If you are unable to obtain your verification in person, you may request a verification to be sent via express shipment. To do so, fax or mail a written request to the Registrar's Office. Your written request must include: • student's name on academic record • student's social security number (optional, not required) • student's birth date (if available) • specific information to be verified • any forms to be included with the verification • address where verification should be sent • Fee made payable to UC REGENTS › verifications are $17 per copy › domestic express shipments cost an additional $25 per domestic address › international express shipments cost an additional $35 per international address If faxing your request, payment may be sent electronically to the Central Cashier through Western Union. (The Central Cashier does not accept credit or debit cards.) 3) You may send your written request via an express shipping service to the Central Cashier, rather than using regular postal mail. B. May I authorize another person to obtain my verification for me? Yes. You may authorize another person to obtain your verification for you. To do so, you must provide the person or the Registrar's Office with a signed letter authorizing him/her to obtain copies of your verification. Your letter must include the following: • what information you would like verified • the specific name of the person you are authorizing • your name • your Student ID number (if known) • your birth date • last four digits of your Social Security Number (if you have one) • your signature Your authorized representative must provide a valid photo ID. Therefore, indicating "my mom" or "my friend" will not be sufficient. Your authorized representative will also need to pay any applicable fees for your verification. Therefore she/he will need to arrive during the Central Cashier's business hours. The Central Cashier does not accept credit or debit cards for payment. You may also fax your authorization letter directly to the Registrar's Office. However, the fee payment for your verification would still need to be received before your order can be processed. If faxing your request, payment may be sent electronically to the Central Cashier through Western Union. (The Central Cashier does not accept credit or debit cards.) 15. Waitlists A. I dropped a discussion in order to add a different discussion, but by the time I tried to add the new discussion, it was full. As a result I was dropped from the lecture as well. What can I do to enroll in this course? If the lecture is full, waitlist the lecture and a discussion. If the lecture is open: • Enroll in the lecture • Enroll in an open discussion (even if it is not your first choice) • Waitlist your preferred discussion If a seat becomes available, the waitlist system will drop you from the enrolled discussion and add you into your preferred waitlisted discussion.
