Starting Monday, December 15 we’re updating the library catalog to give it a fresher look and feel and to improve the mobile experience. We’re also introducing a new catalog feature, “add to my lists,” that allows you to save lists of materials you might be interested in later. But don’t worry. Popular catalog features you’ve come to rely on – like send via text and preferred searching – are staying put. We’ll continue to improve the catalog over the next few weeks.
