The 123 points easily topped the previous program and Big Sky record of 111 points scored by the squad last year at Weber State. The 47 made field goals by the Hornets also broke the previous program record of 41 and was one shy of the Big Sky record as Sacramento State shot a season-best 54.0% from the field. With 16 steals in the game the Hornets also broke the Big Sky single season steals record with 449, besting the previous mark of 434 set by Idaho in 1982-83. With the win Sacramento State (13-14, 11-5 Big Sky) moved one game in front of Eastern Washington for second place in the Big Sky with two games left in the regular season. Montana beat Eastern Washington on Saturday to clinch the regular season conference title and will serve as host of the Big Sky Tournament. Portland State (3-24, 1-15 Big Sky) dropped its 12th consecutive game. Junior Adella Randle-El led six Hornets in double figures with 23 points, making a career high 5-of-6 from 3-point range and 9-of-13 overall. Senior Fantasia Hilliard had 19 points and eight assists, senior Andrea Chenier hit four 3-pointers and totaled 14 points, and Gretchen Harrigan (13 points), Takara Burse (11), and Hallie Gennett (10) also reached double figures. All 15 active Hornets played in the game and all scored at least two points. Sacramento State was 47-of-87 (54.0%) overall from the field and 18-of-41 (43.9%) from 3-point range. The squad could have had an even high score if it had shot better from the free throw line, going 11-of-24 (45.8%) in the contest. The Hornets committed just four turnovers in the game and forced 27, outscoring the Vikings 50-7 in points off turnovers. The home team also had a 52-20 edge in points in the paint and got 71 points off its bench. The game was competitive in the first half, with neither team leading by more than four points over the first 15 minutes of the contest. Portland State led by five, 42-37, with four and a half minutes left in the half before the Hornets took over, making 11 of their last 13 shots of the half and outscoring the Vikings 26-3 over the final 4:27 to lead 63-45 at the intermission. Sacramento State made its first five shots of the second half as well and the Vikings opened the second half 2-of-14 from the field. The Hornets opened the half on a 9-0 run, extending to a 35-3 run overall to open a 27-point advantage with still 18 minutes to play. Sacramento State broke 100 points on a layup by sophomore Ashlyn Crenshaw with 10:09 left in the game and had a game-high 48-point lead at 115-67 with three minutes remaining. Incredibly, the last 2-point field goal made by either team came with more than seven minutes remaining, as Sacramento State's last four made shots were threes and Portland State's last six made shots were threes, failing to make a 2-point shot over the last 14 minutes of the contest. The 46-point final margin of victory was the largest against a Div.-I team in program history and tied for the seventh largest win overall. Sacramento State outscored Portland State 60-32 in the second half, forcing 14 Viking turnovers in the period, and over the last 24 minutes of the game outscored the Vikings 86-35. Portland State shot a solid 46.4% from the field but attempted 31 fewer shots than the Hornets and also missed 11 free throws. The Vikings had a 43-40 rebounding edge but Sacramento State pulled in 21 offensive boards, right on its NCAA-leading average. Portland State, with just eight dressed players, had two in double figures led by 27 points on 8-of-14 shooting from Emily Easom, who played nearly the entire 40 minutes. Mikaela Rivard had 19 but nine turnovers for the Vikings, who lost by 32 points when the teams met in Portland on Feb. 7 in a game in which the Hornets broke the Big Sky steals record with 30. While Montana has clinched the top seed for the Big Sky Tournament the Hornets can claim second place with two more home wins next week. Sacramento State hosts Southern Utah at 7 p.m. Thursday and closes the regular season hosting Northern Arizona at 2 p.m. next Saturday.
