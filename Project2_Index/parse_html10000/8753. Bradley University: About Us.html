The focus of the College of Engineering and Technology at Bradley University is engaging, hands-on, team based engineering education. Our faculty have achieved a high level of technical competence in their field, and are committed to teaching and mentoring students. Some of this hands-on activity is participation in student projects such as the ASCE Concrete Canoe and Steel Bridge Competition, the SAE Formula car competition, and participation in the University's Exposition of Student Projects. Virtually all our senior projects are industry supported real problems for which the student teams provide real engineering solutions. With available co-op positions, summer internships, and our unique industry practicum program, our students can gain valuable "on the job" experience that makes them sought by industrial employers. I invite you to explore the Bradley University College of Engineering and Technology by following links from our home page to learn about our different departments, programs, and student activities.
