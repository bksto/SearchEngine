Once you've installed a client to your computer, you will need your IT Active Directory/Exchange user name and password to configure the software. Access your Exchange account from any computer with an Internet connection using Outlook Web App (OWA). The Web browsers below will work best with the Web interface for Exchange. Note: We do not recommend using OWA on mobile devices.  Exchange Email & Calendar Software Recommendations Windows Mac OS X Mobile Outlook 2013 Outlook 2011 iOS 6.0, 6.2 & later (iOS 6.1.x not recommended) Outlook 2010 Apple Mail (latest) Android 2.3 & later Outlook 2007 Apple iCal (latest)   Exchange on the Web (OWA) Browser Recommendations Windows Mac OS X Linux Internet Explorer 7.x & later Safari 3.x & later Firefox 3.x & later Firefox 3.x & later Firefox 3.x & later   Chrome 3.x & later     Note: The software, operating systems, and browsers that work best with Exchange may not be the same as UMass Amherst IT's Supported Software list.  Last Updated: Aug. 27, 2014 Facebook Like Printer-friendly version Related Topics Exchange F.A.Q Get IT Help Request Help Live Chat Contact the IT Help Center: 413-545-9400 (8:30 a.m. - 4:45 p.m., M-F) Email: it@umass.edu Suggestions & Feedback   IT Home About UMass Amherst IT Policies Employment Forms Learning Commons IT Transparency Initiative UMass Home This site is maintained by UMass Amherst Information Technology. © University of Massachusetts Amherst. • Site Policies.
