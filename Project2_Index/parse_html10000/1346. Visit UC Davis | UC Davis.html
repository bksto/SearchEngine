Students can hop on a bike and get to their next class quickly. The Quad, seen here from the porch of North Hall, is a major hub for student activities. UC Davis, one of the top five eco-friendly colleges and universities for 2013, is known for its student-run bus system. The campus is filled with public art. Here, a student sits on one of the "Yin and Yang" Eggheads near Wright Theatre. The UC Davis Arboretum is considered the jewel of our beautiful campus. The 12,000-plus member Aggie Pack is always there to cheer on our team. The Band-Uh!, also known as the California Aggie Marching Band, performs during games. As part of our football tradition, the Aggie flag is carried around the stadium each time our team scores. When it opened in 2007, Aggie Stadium was the first college stadium in the country to set the goal of zero waste. The Main Reading Room in Shields Library offers a quiet space for students. The Memorial Union's Coffee House is a great place to get a bite to eat between classes. Students also find the Coffee House a convenient place to link up with others. Davis experiences all four seasons: fall when the leaves change… …a few winter rainstorms… …many sunny days during spring… …and summer. In fact, the average 265 days of sunshine encourages outdoor activities to take advantage of our campus.
