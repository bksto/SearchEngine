UC Transfer Admission Planner What to Expect When You Transfer The academic experience at UCSB for transfer students is both challenging and stimulating. Academic preparation at your current campus is the most important factor in making a smooth transition to UCSB. More comprehensive and challenging lower division coursework can help prepare you for university work and increses your likelihood of academic success. Concentrate on classes required as preparation for upper division work in your intended major. Completing your major preparation coursework and general education requirements before you transfer can make you a more competitive applicant and help you graduate in a timely manner. Transfer students will be stepping into a new environment, and success in adjusting will depend on personal initiative. Here are a few tips for transfer applicants to transition to UCSB:  Concentrate on preparing for your major at your community college. Read transfer tips from the College of Letters and Science. Expect rigorous coursework. If you are transferring from a semester system, plan for the faster pace of UCSB's quarter system. Give courses priority over work. Seek out career contacts early. Get involved in the Transfer Student Association or other clubs and organizations. Admissions Guide Connect with Admissions Counselors Stay connected and informed about what’s happening at UCSB.
