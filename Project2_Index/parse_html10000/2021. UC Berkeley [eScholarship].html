Center for Studies in Higher Education From Our Faculty "eScholarship is a great publishing platform for our California Journal of Politics and Policy. We wanted to transition the journal to an open-access platform, and eScholarship allows us to publish in a way that is accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world. Given the reliability of publishing with eScholarship and its affiliation with one of the world's greatest universities, eScholarship is an ideal option for publishers of serious academic work." — Ethan Rarick, Director, Robert T.
