One side argues that austerity is expansionary when achieved via spending cuts rather than tax increases. An alternative view, consistent with textbook prescriptions for countercyclical fiscal policy, suggests that fiscal consolidation is harmful to growth when implemented in the midst of a crisis. Both camps, however, ignore the wealth of information inherent in comparing the economic performance of countries that pursue fiscal austerity with those that opt for a different path.

Read more — Biography: Professor Nicholas Economides Department: Economics — Opinion The Negative Way to Growth? - By Nouriel Roubini Monetary policy has become increasingly unconventional in the last six years, with central banks implementing zero-interest-rate policies, quantitative easing, credit easing, forward guidance, and unlimited exchange-rate intervention. But now we have come to the most unconventional policy tool of them all: negative nominal interest rates. Read more — Biography: Professor Nouriel Roubini Department: Economics — Opinion Why Public Investment? - By A. Michael Spence The world is facing the prospect of an extended period of weak economic growth. But risk is not fate: The best way to avoid such an outcome is to figure out how to channel large pools of savings into productivity-enhancing public-sector investment.

Michael Spence Department: Economics — Opinion New Research Shows Online Movie Buzz is a Good Predictor of Box Office Success Just in time for the Oscars, Professors C. Samuel Craig and William Greene of the NYU Stern School of Business, and co-author Anthony Versaci of AIG, are releasing a new study demonstrating that online buzz prior to a film’s release is a good indicator of its future box office success. The authors contend that movie studios are in a position to use “e-buzz” to their advantage by adjusting advertising budgets and marketing strategies in real-time to increase the film’s likelihood of success.

The bank’s strategic challenges were made clear in late January when its fourth-quarter results showed return on equity of 2.6%, about 20% of its cost of equity capital. Management said the performance was “encouraging” – but the equity market continues to value the bank’s shares at only half book value. Read more — Biography: Professors Roy C. Smith and Brad Hintz Department: Finance — Opinion Fair Debt Relief for Greece: New Calculations - By Thomas Philippon Fairness is a loaded word, but, whether we like it or not, it is at the heart of the political economy of debt restructuring in Europe. Until we reach some understanding on this issue, the conversation will continue to run in circles. Clearly the odious debt argument does not apply to Greece (Beck 2015). Greece was and is a democracy. Greek citizens elected the governments that ran the reckless fiscal policy that drove Greece into a deep financial crisis.

In their new paper, House Prices, Local Demand and Retail Prices, the researchers demonstrate that rising house prices lead to a corresponding increase in local retail prices. Read more — Biography: Professor Johannes Stroebel Department: Finance — Research Highlights How to Lead in Ambiguous Times - By Ian Bremmer A glance at today’s headlines leaves little doubt that we have entered a new era of geopolitical turbulence. Acts of terror and violence, humanitarian crises, and public health emergencies are rarely localized events. Instead, these shocks transcend borders, presenting global challenges. Just as one crisis fades, another rises to take its place. Adding further complexity, today’s enemy (unlike in that previous period of great geopolitical uncertainty, the Cold War) is often unseen or unknown.

Bottom line: Cuba may well become a rising star in the region and an attractive economic partner for the U.S. if things are managed well. In financial terms, Cuba will be a "buy" when the time comes. A recent visit revealed some impressive strengths buried not far below the surface. Read more — Biography: Professor Ingo Walter Department: Finance — Opinion Corporate Tax Cuts and the Economy - By Alexander Ljungqvist The new Congress is sure to take up the eternal question of reforming the tax code, and just as surely there will be debate about whether cutting corporate taxes will help stimulate employment and boost income. Read more — Biography: Professor Alexander Ljungqvist Department: Finance — Research Highlights Prof. Deepak Hegde's research on patents and disclosure Excerpt from Science 2.0 -- "The change in the law created an opportunity for Graham and his colleague Deepak Hegde, an assistant professor of management and organizations at NYU's Stern School of Business, to examine which inventors were choosing to opt into the secrecy loophole, and whether their patents differed in important ways. They examined 1.8 million granted patents filed at the USPTO from 1995 to 2005 and analyzed the disclosure preferences of the inventors. Their analysis found that, among those not seeking foreign protection, about 85 percent of inventors filing a patent since 2000 chose to disclose information about their patents prior to their approval." Read more — Biography: Professor Deepak Hegde Department: Management and Organizations — Research in the News The Human Element in Investment Decisions - By Zur Shapira When managers make strategic investment decisions, they tend to anchor their decisions on the average return on investment, or average ROI, that can be expected post-investment, rather than on the anticipated marginal profit measured by the discounted cash flow, or net present value (NPV) – thereby deviating from a firm’s overall goal of maximizing profit. This decision-making behavior, subtle but critical, was recently demonstrated by NYU Stern Management Professor Zur Shapira. Read more — Biography: Professor Zur Shapira Department: Management and Organizations — Research Highlights Prof. Paul Romer and Research Scholar Brandon Fuller's research on urbanization Excerpt from Forbes -- "...Prudential Investment Management recently issued a report arguing that urbanization across the globe is in its 'prime time.' The report cites a projection from New York University professors Paul Romer and Brandon Fuller that cities worldwide will gain more than 60 million people annually over the next three decades." Read more — Biography: Professor Paul Romer Department: Economics — Research in the News Research Debunks Perception that Inventors Prefer to Keep Patent Know-How Secret - By Deepak Hegde In a new study, Professor Deepak Hegde of the NYU Stern School of Business and Stuart Graham of Georgia Institute of Technology discredit the conventional wisdom that public disclosure by inventors of their proprietary knowledge when their patents are pending is costly for them because it alerts rivals and facilitates imitation by others.

Some are hoping for more constructive engagement between Congress and the president, now that the GOP might want to try to show that it, too, can govern. But there's good reason to believe that's wishful thinking. The destructive dynamic of recent years is not the result of one or two factors that can be easily reversed. Rather, it is the result of at least 10 trends that have played out over the past half-century. Here are the most important things to understand about how Washington became so broken.

Read more — Biography: Dean Geeta Menon Department: Marketing — Research in the News Prof. Alexander Ljungqvist's research on corporate tax breaks Excerpt from The Huffington Post -- "According to a working paper by Alexander Ljungqvist and Michael Smolyansky, economists at New York University, corporate tax breaks at the state level don’t help create jobs. There’s one exception: Tax cuts do help create jobs and boost incomes when they are implemented during recessions, the paper says."

From Tiananmen in China to Tahrir in Egypt, student movements have elevated public discourse on human rights. On some human-rights issues that affect universities themselves, such as in addressing global sweatshop practices, student groups have served as catalysts, prompting colleges and universities to assume a leadership role in our society.

Proponents of "wisdom of the crowds" contend that such data may contain within it some key insights about specific variables of interest. So can we find any evidence of this wisdom in big data?  Read more — Biography: Professor Vasant Dhar Department: IOMS — Opinion Popular Science - By Adam Alter The first thing I learned in law school is that law school is not for learning the law. My decorated professor explained that we would spend twenty hours each week reading and discussing cases—and that very few of those cases would ever again figure in our lives as lawyers. Those hours were not wasted, but it was not because they filled our heads with legal content that they were useful.

Not for the highly-regarded work on competition between small numbers of firms with which his career began more than thirty years ago but for more recent work on how carefully structured regulation can improve performance relative to unbridled market forces. This is a reminder that serious students of market performance take market failures seriously.

Studies have predicted that up to 40% of the U.S. workforce population will be part of this ‘on-demand’ labor pool (contractors, freelancers and temp workers) within the next six years. The primary motivation for companies to crowdsource, whether for labor, design, ideas or funding, is to reduce costs in a challenging economic environment, as well as to harness the skills, collective knowledge and wisdom of the crowds to complement the skills of their employees.  Read more — Biography: Professor Anindya Ghose Department: IOMS — Opinion Women in Data Science Are Invisible. We Can Change That. - By Claudia Perlich I have to admit that I never really gave the number of women in data science much thought until recently.

And about half of my predictive modeling group peers at IBM Research were female. And half of the PhDs here at Dstillery are female.

Details of this transition will be high on the agenda as ICANN stakeholders meet in Los Angeles this week.
