Through an engaged and innovative curriculum that responds to state and regional needs, the anthropology program trains students in qualitative and quantitative research methods that include ethnography, participant observation, visual ethnography, social documentation, ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, and applied archaeology. The anthropology major distinguishes itself through long-term collaborative research projects that enhance student learning experiences, promote the interests of local communities, and practice complementary exchange between the university and the community. There are two options providing different paths to completion of the anthropology major: Medical Anthropology or Indigenous Anthropology. MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY—focus on the study of medical systems, health care systems, access to and utilization of health care, medicinal concepts and practices, ethnobotany, and forms of diagnosis, prognosis, illness causation, and disease etiologies. Advanced students conduct field research and internships in the context of community-based research projects, health care settings, and internships. INDIGENOUS ANTHROPOLOGY—focus on working collaboratively with regional indigenous communities on long-term research and social documentation projects. Advanced students conduct field and laboratory research in collaboration with community-driven social documentation projects. FUTURE OPTIONS—currently interwoven into the existing anthropology options and programmed to become independent anthropology concentrations include: visual anthropology, ecological anthropology, and the anthropology of religion. © Copyright 2013 California State University San Marcos.
