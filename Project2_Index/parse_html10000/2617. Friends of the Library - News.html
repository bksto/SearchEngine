New Dean, University Library In concurrence with President Gonzalez, I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Ms. Amy Kautzman as the new Dean of the University Library. She will begin March 2, 2015. Ms. Kautzman currently serves as Associate University Librarian, Academic Services, University of California, Davis.  She was selected through a national search with a strong pool of applicants. Prior to her current position, she was the Associate University Librarian, Humanities and Social Services and Acting Head of Access Services at UC Davis. Before she joined the UC Davis Library, she served as Department Head for Research, Reference, and Collections at the University Library at UC Berkeley.  In her nearly 25 years of university library professional experience she also held senior librarian positions at Harvard College Library, Harvard University, Cambridge and at the University Library, Northeastern College, Boston. Ms. Kautzman is a very strong and prolific scholar/librarian with numerous publications and conference presentations and has substantial experience leading and managing academic services in the library that supports research, teaching, learning, access and special collections services.  Her strong national experience also includes leading reorganization of libraries that map libraries to campus strategic goals for student success.  She earned her BA in Literature from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities Campus, Minneapolis; her Master of Science in Library Science from Simmons College, Boston and an MA in Literature from Northeastern University, Boston.  We look forward to welcoming Ms. Kautzman as the new Library dean early in the Spring 2015 semester.  Meanwhile, please join me in thanking Dr. Janet Hecsh, Professor in the College of Education who has served as Administrator-in-Charge of the University Library during the search process for a new library dean.  The University is immensely grateful to Dr. Hecsh for her very effective leadership and management of the Library during a period of transition.
