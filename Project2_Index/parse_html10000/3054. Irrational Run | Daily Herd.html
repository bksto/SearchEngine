This race, aptly titled the ‎Irrational Run, will be held on Saturday, 3-14-15, at 9 a.m. “This is a special day in which to celebrate WPI’s sesquicentennial and our beautiful campus, with the WPI community,” says Amy Morton, WPI’s chief marketing officer. “It will transform the campus into a fun and festive environment”, she joked, “even if we still have 3.1415926 feet of snow.” The course will traverse the campus, going by the Rubin Campus Center, Sports and Recreation Center, East Hall, Gordon Library and the Fountain, among other landmarks. The university Facilities and Police departments will make sure the course is clear and safe, and there will be music at the finish”, Morton said. Chartwells catering will supply water and fruit, and post-race refreshments. Could make for a crowded field, with approximately 400 runners expected. Walkers are welcome, too. “We’ve never done a Pi Day race before,” Morton says. “In 2015, Pi Day has a special meaning, not only because it is our sesquicentennial year, but because it adds the next correct digit to pi.” Registration/check-in will start at 8 a.m., with the race kicking off at 9. The first 26 runners to finish will receive a special prize. There will be other activities the day of the event, sponsored by some of WPI’s student organizations. Please note that every individual running the race must sign a waiver, and is required to complete a registration form. The Irrational Run is free to the WPI Community-faculty, staff, students and alumni. For more information contact: irrationalrun@wpi.edu.
