Creating a positive environment that promotes their health, wellness, safety and security is of upmost importance to the university, and we’ve established guidelines and expectations for program administrators, faculty, staff, students and volunteers. All programs that are registered with the university follow the U-M Standard Practice Guide: Policy on Minors Involved in University Sponsored Programs or Programs Held in University Facilities. These guidelines apply to programs and activities under the direction and authority of the university on all campuses (Ann Arbor, UMHS, UM-Flint, UM-Dearborn, Athletics) or off-campus. Additional guidelines exist for programs that are not sponsored by the university but take place on university campuses or facilities.
