Academics Campus Life Money Matters Beyond CSUSM IN THIS SECTION Money Matters Cost of Attendance Financial Aid Education Pays fgj Don’t be startled by the sticker price of a college education. Your cost of attendance (COA) doesn’t just cover your college tuition; it takes into account your basic living expenses too. So think about this: it is going to cost you the same amount to live for the next few years whether you’re in college or not…. and college graduates earn an average of $20,000 MORE a year than students who only completes high school. When comparing financial aid packages from other schools, make sure you are comparing the total cost of attending that school, not just the total financial aid awarded. It is important for you to budget and make wise decisions regarding how to utilize the financial aid funds you receive. Students are not allowed to receive aid that exceeds their cost of attendance.
