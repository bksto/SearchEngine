Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. NOTE: At UCI, an "applicant" becomes a "student" at the time of submission of their Statement of Intent to Register form. Disclosure The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), by the State of California Education Code, and by University policy and procedures implementing these laws which protect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confidentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of personally identifiable information from their student records; to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; to file complaints with the Family Policy Compliance Office regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, confidential information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student (a) in connection with conditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is complying with a judicial order or subpoena; and (c) when authorized federal or state officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs. There are also other situations in which the University is required to disclose information. See Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part B, Section 130.721 for a list of exceptions. Public and UCI Directory Information Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identifiable information which can be made public: student's name date and place of birth addresses (local and/or permanent)† campus email address telephone numbers† dates of attendance major field of study grade level degrees and honors received number of course units in which enrolled enrollment status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time) most recent previous educational institution attended participation in officially recognized activities, including intercollegiate athletics name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate University athletic teams photo However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. Please view the UCI Student Information Release Matrix to see what information is available for release, and what groups may have access to that information. † Students with an active UCInetID can update this information through StudentAccess. Restricting UCI Directory Information Students may restrict all or part of their directory information by updating their release options through the University Registrar. Physical addresses, next of kin addresses, and phone numbers can be updated through StudentAccess by students with an active UCInetID. Students without an active UCInetID must contact the Registrar to update their release options. Updates are sent directly to OIT, who is responsible for maintaining the campus directory. OIT processes the data received on a nightly basis. Changes made to directory information through StudentAccess will be reflected the following day, and should be reviewed by the student to ensure that the information selected to be restricted is no longer visible in the directory. Implications of Restricting Student Records If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the campus cannot release for publication any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the student. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a student cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure their degree granted and the date on which their degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed to a third party without the written consent of the student. Third parties include graduate schools and employers. Maintaining Student Records It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as personal data changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Physical addresses, next of kin addresses, and phone numbers can be updated through StudentAccess by students with an active UCInetID. More Information Students are informed annually of their rights under the University's student records policies and FERPA. Copies of FERPA and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Langson Library. In addition, University policies are published in Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded students by FERPA may be filed with the Family Policy Compliance Office. Types and locations of major student records maintained by the campus are listed in the Student Record Location Index. Consult the Campus Directory or building directories for room numbers. For questions, email the FERPA Analyst. NOTE: Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), individual institutions may implement disclosure policies that exceed those outlined in the Act. It should be noted that University of California policies are more restrictive than those outlined in FERPA. The disclosure policies for the UC campuses are outlined in the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, sections 130.00-134.00. © 2008 UC Regents University Registrar registrar@uci.edu • tel: (949) 824-6124 • fax: (949) 824-7896 215 Aldrich Hall • Irvine, CA 92697-4975 hours: Monday–Friday, 8:00 a.m.–5:00 p.m.
