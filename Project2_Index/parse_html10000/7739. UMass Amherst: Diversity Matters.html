Skip navigation UMass Amherst Diversity Matters Message from Debora Ferreira Executive Director for Equal Opportunity and Diversity Welcome to Diversity Matters at UMass Amherst, where you can find information about the exemplary work that is being done in the area of diversity on our campus and in the local area. Diversity in all its forms is integral to the success of this institution. UMass Amherst safeguards freedom of speech and prohibits discrimination due to race, color, religion, creed, sex, age, marital status, national origin, political belief or affiliation, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic information and disability. As always, to report any civil rights related concerns that you may have, you can contact the Office of Equal Opportunity & Diversity by phone or email at: eod@admin.umass.edu. UMass Amherst is a diverse and multicultural community that values, supports and is accepting of differences; a community that continually strives to be equitable, fair and inclusive. This website will showcase best practices for diversity programs that work on our campus and in the local area. A key goal for this website is to enhance communication and collaboration in the area of diversity, both across campus and in the surrounding communities.  As a brief background, during the spring of 2010, new steps were taken to strengthen and revitalize diversity initiatives on campus. Then Chancellor Holub formed the Chancellor’s Diversity Advisory Committee to serve as an advisory board on matters of diversity. This Committee brings together offices, programs and individuals who do important work to advance the campus’s commitment to diversity and equity, and is comprised of faculty, staff, students and community members. As charged, the Committee developed a Diversity Mission Statement for the campus, and contributed to the development of a comprehensive diversity and equity plan. The Diversity Plan describes UMass Amherst’s continuing efforts to promote diversity and outlines priorities that will help to guide our steps and focus our efforts as we move forward in this important arena. Matters of diversity are a top priority at UMass Amherst. Each of us contributes to and has a role in building the diversity of our campus community. In order to further this important message, you are invited to share events, programs and activities related to diversity. This website is a work in progress and your feedback and updates are welcome.   Welcome Message from Executive Director of EO&D Chancellor's Diversity Advisory Committee Administrative Policies and Procedures Title IX Reports and Data Training and Workshops Academic Programs and Opportunities Student Resources Faculty and Staff Resources Campus and Community Resources Upcoming Events The Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity Phone (V/TTY) 413.545.3464 Contact us: diversity@admin.umass.edu EVENTS UMass Amherst Calendar Fine Arts Center Calendar Five College Arts Calendar UMass Multicultural Events Calendar Amherst College Multicultural Resource Center Calendar Hampshire College Cultural Center Calendar of Events Mt.
