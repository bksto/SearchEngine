Forms Parents Faculty / Staff Parents Information for Parents of Undergraduate Students The Parent Contribution The parent contribution is a central component to helping your child meet their educational expenses. While undergraduate costs can be significant, Stanford’s financial aid program can assist your family with these expenses. To better understand financial aid at Stanford, our section on How Aid Works can provide you with information about how we calculate your parent contribution and how aid eligibility is determined. Financing the Expected Parent Contribution You have many options when it comes to financing educational costs. The best option varies with individual family situations. Some families choose to use their student’s federal student loan eligibility to help finance the expected parent contribution. See our information about Federal Direct Loans for the student loan program most commonly used. Some families prefer to do any borrowing in the parents' names. The Federal Direct PLUS Loan is one available option. In addition, Stanford is working with SoFi to offer lower-cost parent loan options for parents with a good credit record. Feel free to review our comparison between the two loan programs on our Private/Alternative Parent Loans page. Installment Payment Plan Student Financial Services, the billing office at Stanford, offers an Installment Payment Plan (IPP) that allows undergraduates to spread payments of large University fees over three monthly installments per term, or 9 months for the entire academic year. Installments may be calculated based on remaining charges after anticipated financial aid has been taken into account. There is no finance, interest or enrollment fee to participate in the IPP. For more details please refer to the Student Financial Services website. Note that the enrollment deadline for fall quarter is July 15th. Parent Access to Student Records Stanford’s Office of the University Registrar posts Stanford’s policies regarding privacy of student information under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Under FERPA, our office will not disclose any student’s financial aid information to parents unless the student provides written consent. Likewise, we will not share detailed parent information with the student (or others) without parent consent.
